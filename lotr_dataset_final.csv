'''Voronwë Aranwion''' was a mariner of [[Gondolin]].

==History==
Voronwë was affiliated with the [[House of Fingolfin]] through his father, [[Aranwë]], and to [[Círdan]] through his mother, who was one of the [[Sindar]] Elves of the [[Falas]].

In {{FA|455}}, following the [[Dagor Bragollach|breaking of the Siege of Angband]], [[Turgon]], the King of Gondolin, sent out a few of his people on a secret errand; they went down to the [[Mouths of Sirion]] where they built ships. It accomplished little, however, as the Noldor lacked the art of ship-building, and they were only able to go so far as the [[Isle of Balar]] where they established lonely dwellings.<ref name=""tcg"">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

After Turgon learned of the [[Fall of the Falas|ravaging of the Falas]], and of Círdan's relocation of a remnant of his people to the [[Isle of Balar]], he sent further messengers, including Voronwě.<ref name=""tcg"" />

Voronwë delayed on the road, tarrying in [[Nan-tathren]] and because of this he was the final one to embark on the last ship that Círdan, at the request of Turgon, had built for them. After sailing for seven years without reaching the lands in the West, his ship attempted to return to Middle-Earth defeated. In a storm within sight of the coast the ship was wrecked and all save him were drowned. By the grace of Ulmo, Voronwë was saved from the wreck and washed ashore in [[Nevrast]], near [[Vinyamar]]. He was sitting at its wall when he encountered [[Tuor]] and heard his story as the messenger of Ulmo and led him back to Gondolin.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]] he was ordered by Tuor to guard [[Idril]]. He escaped the sack.

It is said that he may have left Middle-earth with Tuor and Idril.<ref name=""Tuor"" />

==Etymology==
''Voronwë'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Steadfast""<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Voronwë""</ref> or ""steadfastness"".<ref name=""Eldarin"">{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 189</ref>

The [[Sindarin]] cognate for ''Voronwë'' was '''''Bronwë'''''.<ref name=""Eldarin"" />

His epithet '''''Aranwion''''' was his patronymic, meaning simply ""Son of [[Aranwë]]"".<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ""Aranwë""</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', his [[Qenya]] name ''Voronwë'' meant ""the Faithful"", but he was mostly known in [[Gnomish]] '''''Bronweg''''' (""the Constant One"").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Bronweg""</ref> As in later works, he is the guide of Tuor, but also the father of [[Littleheart]] &ndash; a figure that does not recur elsewhere.<ref name=""LT2Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}, passim</ref>

According to the earlier and most accounts, he sailed with [[Eärendel]] on his voyages, not Tuor.<ref name=""SM"">{{SM|Q17}}</ref>

'''Brodda''' was an [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]] who was made a lord in [[Dor-lómin]] by [[Morgoth]] following the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]. He took possession of [[Húrin]]'s lands and was eventually slain by [[Túrin]].

== History ==
During the [[First Age]], after Morgoth captured the land of [[Hithlum]], Brodda was made a lord. He took to wife (against her will) [[Aerin]] of the [[House of Hador]], a kinswoman of Húrin, and took Húrin's lands and possessions.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 68</ref> When in {{FA|495}}<ref>{{GA|288}}</ref> Túrin, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin, he learned from Aerin that his mother, [[Morwen]], had left [[Hithlum]]. In his rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who burnt herself alive in her [[Brodda's hall|hall]], and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] now was persecuted even more cruelly.<ref>{{CH|12}}, pp. 188-90</ref>

{{familytree/end}}

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Brodda already appears in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. The concept of the Easterlings invading [[Hisilómë]] was not present, but he is the lord of those lands inhabited by [[Men]], as well as a horrible husband for [[Airin]]. When [[Mavwin]] decided to leave Hisilómë and asked to Airin that Brodda took care of her properties, he accepted without problem. But once Mavwin and [[Nienóri]] left, he added all her goods to his own, and did not take care her house or lands, so he was considered a bad lord and thief by his own people. When [[Turambar]] heard about this, became enraged and went to [[Brodda's hall]]. Airin was not there, but he was welcomed to the dinner party that was taking place, although he rejected the food they offered to him.

{{blockquote|Then Turambar stepping out into the midst of them before the high place where Brodda sat said: ""Behold, I am Turambar son of the forest"", and men laughed thereat, but Turambar's eyes were full of wrath. Then said Brodda in doubt: ""What wilt thou of me, O son of the wild forest?"" But Turambar said: ""Lord Brodda, I am come to repay thy stewardship of others' goods,"" and silence fell in that place; but Brodda laughed, saying again: ""But who art thou?"" And thereupon Turambar leapt upon the high place and ere Brodda might foresee the act he drew [[Gurtholfin]] and seizing Brodda by the locks all but smote his head from off his body, crying aloud: ""So dieth the rich man who addeth the widow's little to his much. Lo, men die not all in the wild woods, and am I not in truth the son of [[Úrin]], who having sought back unto his folk findeth an empty hall despoiled.""}}

Seeing Turambar's crime, people in the hall revolted. Some did not appreciated Brodda and did not even unsheath their swords, but others attacked Turambar, of which [[Orlin]] was killed. Airin appeared and stopped everyone. She was shocked because of the crime commited, but spoke a favorable judgement against Turambar, recognizing how unfair Brodda had been towards Mavwin. Everyone approved, ignoring how horrible was Airin's life beside that man.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 89-91, 93</ref>

==History==
In ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', when the elves of the [[Woodland Realm]] capture [[Thorin and Company]], Tauriel takes an interest in the young dwarf [[Kíli]]. When she learns of his being struck by a poisoned arrow by [[Bolg]] in the Company's escape from custody in wine barrels, she goes after him in hopes of healing his wound. [[Legolas]] (who is shown to be protective of her) joins her in pursuit of the [[Orcs]] who were after the company. The two of them manage to reach them in [[Lake-town]] and kill many of them, while Tauriel also manages to heal Kíli with ''[[athelas]]'' found on the premises.

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', after she has succeeded in healing Kíli, the dragon [[Smaug]] attacks Lake-town. Luckily, she manages to escape the dragon's fiery  wrath. Later on, during the aftermath of Smaug's attack on Lake-town, Kíli confesses his love for her. After that, she accompanies Legolas to [[Gundabad]] to discover another Orc army heading for the [[Lonely Mountain]], as well as thousands of [[bats]]. They return in time for the [[Battle of Five Armies|Battle of the Five Armies]]. She kills many Orcs and [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]]. Nearing the end of the battle, she confronts [[Thranduil]] who ordered his troops to withdraw. Thranduil was about to kill her, probably because she threatened him and claimed that he had no love in his heart, most likely offending him, when [[Legolas]] intervened. Tauriel went off to look for the dwarf [[Kili]], attempting to save him. However, during the battle, she witnesses Kíli's death at the hands of [[Bolg]]. After the battle, she confesses her love over Kíli's body. It is unknown what happens to her after this.

==Etymology==
The name ''Tauriel'', ""daughter of Mirkwood""<ref name=""PJCasting"" /> (or more literally, ""daughter of the forest"") is made from the Sindarin word ''[[taur]]'' meaning ""forest"", and the patronymic ending ''[[-iel]]'' which means ""daughter of"".

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - The Stranger poster.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Stranger poster'' for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]

When the way into [[Aman]] opened to allow [[Galadriel]] and her fellow [[Elves]] access, a mysterious meteorite left Aman at the same time carrying with it an Istar as it flew towards [[Middle-earth]] above the [[Straight Road]]. Many of the inhabitants of Middle-earth bore witness to the fiery meteor as it tore across the sky including but not limited to: [[Gil-galad|High King Gil-galad]], [[Elrond]], [[Celebrimbor|Lord Celebrimbor]], [[Arondir]], [[Bronwyn]], some [[Ents]], and the [[Harfoots]].

The meteorite eventually crashed in a clearing close by to the [[Norfield Glen]] within the [[Rhovanion Hills]]. It was there where the Stranger was discovered by the two young Harfoots: [[Elanor Brandyfoot]] and [[Poppy Proudfellow]]. Elanor, commonly known as Nori, fell into the fiery crater and discovered that the flames in the crater were cold before moving the Stranger in a wheelbarrow to a makeshift tent. 

The next day, the Stranger woke up and began making markings of an unknown meaning on a fallen log. When Nori came back, he shouted, surprised, letting loose a gust of wind, though his surprise subsided after being offered a bowl of [[Snails]].

Later that night, the Stranger freed the [[Flies|Fireflies]] within the lanterns that the Harfoots used. He then forcibly manipulated them into forming the shape of an [[Hermit's Hat|unknown]] [[Constellations|Constellation]].

On the day of festivities before migration, Nori broke into the cart of the elder trailfinder [[Sadoc Burrows]] to look in his almanac, the [[Star-Book|Star-book]], for celestial arrays that match the constellation. Finding one, she brought the torn page to the Stranger before joining a ceremony of remembrance of Harfoots left behind. The Stranger, perusing the page in the light of a fire, accidentally set it alight and clumsily made his presence known to the other Harfoots. As a result of his presence and Nori's involvement, the Brandyfoot cart was to be last in the caravan.

===The migration===
To atone for his errors and to keep the Brandyfoots from being left behind, the Stranger served by pushing their cart. During the migration, Nori taught the Stranger basic language skills. He was able to fully pronounce the word ""Mi-gra-tion"" by the time the Harfoots passed the [[Weedbrook]]. The Stranger continued to aid the Brandyfoots while learning more and more throughout the migration. He aided them through the [[Emyn Muil|Undercliffs]], the [[Dead Marshes|Grey Marshes]], the [[Trout Bend]], and the [[Braids]] of the [[Thistledell]].

Upon reaching an eerie forest, the Stranger found himself needing to save Nori, Poppy, and [[Malva Meadowgrass]] from three ambushing [[Wolves]]. The Stranger drove them away, but at the cost of paralysing his right arm. However, he was able to attempt to freeze his arm into ice with a shallow pool of water, and speaking [[Quenya]] while doing so. When Nori attempted to stop him, he lost control and knocked her back a fair distance.

At the end of the migration, the Harfoots found the [[Grove]] had been destroyed by an [[Udûn (episode)|eruption]] from [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] to the south. [[Sadoc Burrows]] asked the Stranger to attempt to restore it. While the Stranger was able to heal the Grove, a branch of a tree very nearly crushed [[Dilly Brandyfoot]]. While he lost favour with the Harfoots, Sadoc still provided him with which direction he might find information on the constellation he sought after.

===The Grove===
Little did he know that the [[Mystics]], a group of three robed women, consisting of the Ascetic, the Nomad, and [[the Dweller]], had been tracking him. When they reached the [[Grove]] that night, Nori unsuccessfully attempted to misdirect them. The Dweller snatched a hair from Nori's head, magically set all the Harfoots' carts catastrophically ablaze, and with the other Mystics, continued onward in their pursuit.

Upon the Stranger reaching the [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]], presumably the [[East Bight]], the Mystics appeared to him, initially with the Dweller magically guised as Nori. Once they had him menacingly surrounded, the Dweller dropped the guise, and they knelt to him, proclaiming him to be [[Sauron|Lord Sauron]] their master, and told him finally that the constellation which he sought after was called the [[Hermit's Hat]] and was visible only in one place far to the east, in Rhûn.

While the Mystics quickly incapacitated him when he refused to calm down upon being told his identity, four Harfoots led by Sadoc attempted to rescue the Stranger by stealth. However, the Mystics turned the tables on them by the Dweller's use of dark magic to act as a decoy. Then the Ascetic murdered Sadoc, throwing a knife into his stomach. When the Stranger woke, he fell to despair, believing all that the Mystics told him. However, upon being encouraged by Nori, and upon her bringing him the Dweller's staff that she had stealthily taken, he banished the three Mystics back from whence they came. As he did so, the Mystics realized who he truly was: the [[Wizards|Istar]].

After returning to the [[Grove]], the Stranger departed alongside Nori, to venture into Rhûn in order to find out his true name and his origin.

===Journey to Rhûn===
The Stranger and Nori became lost on their way to Rhûn. While en route, they noticed that they were being followed by a mysterious figure. They set a trap for the figure and, upon capturing them, it was revealed that it was their friend Poppy Proudfellow. Poppy had brought Harfoot maps to aid in their journey.
[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Dark Wizard.png|left|thumb|386x386px|The Dark Wizard addressing his acolytes.]]
Later, at [[Caras Gaer]], a mysterious [[Dark Wizard]] admonished his [[Mystics|Mystic]] acolyte, the Dweller, who had failed to capture the Stranger. He changed his approach to capturing the Stranger and instead sent [[Brânk]] and his [[Gaudrim]] scouts to pursue him. Having realized they were being followed, the Stranger and his two friends changed their course to avoid detection. The journey proved arduous and, after running out of water, the Stranger collapsed from dehydration. 

Poppy and Nori soon stumbled upon a well and were able to soothe the Stranger's thirst. However, in doing so, they accidentally revealed their location to [[Brânk]] and the other [[Gaudrim]]. After finding a staff that he recognized from his dreams, the Stranger summoned a sandstorm and caused the scouts to flee. Not having full command of his powers, the staff disintegrated and the sandstorm swept Poppy and Nori away.

===Destiny revealed===
[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - The Stranger meets Tom Bombadil.jpeg|thumb|The Stranger speaking with Tom Bombadil.]]
Searching for the lost Harfoots, the Stranger happened upon a strange bearded man who revealed himself to be [[Tom Bombadil]]. After freeing a Stranger from the grips of a tree, Tom inferred that he is ""[[Eldest]]"" and that he was present before the creation of the [[stars]]. He then revealed that Rhûn was once a verdant land that had recently become a barren waste, and that he had come to see why that was. Tom then explained that it was the Stranger's destiny to combat both the Dark Wizard and Sauron.

Tom Bombadil later took the Stranger to a barren grove of dead trees where the Stranger is meant to find his [[Wizards|Wizard]]'s staff. The Stranger had a vision of Nori and Poppy in the captivity of the Dark Wizard and wanted to help them, but Tom says that he must decide between helping them and fulfilling his destiny as the enemy of the Dark Wizard and Sauron.

===Confronting the Dark Wizard===
The Stranger abandoned his search for the staff and travelled to the dwelling of the [[Stoors]] to save Nori and Poppy. He was met by the Dark Wizard, who implied that he had known the Stranger and was aware of his past, and that he wished for them to become allies who would supplant Sauron. However, after witnessing the Dark Wizard's violence against Brânk as the Gaudrim held Nori and Poppy captive, the Stranger rejected the Dark Wizard's offer. 
[[File:Rings of Power The Stranger Lifts Rocks.png|left|thumb|410x410px|The Stranger using his power to lift the rocks the Dark Wizard cast down from the rim of the Stoors' canyon.]]
The Dark Wizard grew angry and cast a spell which lifted and subsequently dropped many large rocks from the cliffs surrounding the canyon abode of the Stoors. Many of these rocks fell and caused a great deal of damage to the Stoor village, but the Stranger was able to suspend the remaining falling rocks with a counter-spell, saving the lives of the villagers and his Harfoot friends.

The village was in ruin from the damage caused by the Dark Wizard's magic, forcing the Stoors to migrate to find a new home. As they were leaving, the Stoors thanked the Stranger and called him ""Grand Elf"". After speaking with Nori, the Stranger found a branch from a tree in the canyon and adopted it as his new staff. 

Later the Stranger conversed with Tom Bombadil and reflected on the moniker the Stoors had deemed him with: ""Grand Elf"". Upon reflection, he had a moment of [[foresight]] and stated that he would come to be known as [[Gandalf]], and thus revealed his true identity.

== History ==
Princess Mika Milovana was one of three who survived the destruction of [[Dale]] by the dragon [[Smaug|Slag]], the others being a watchman and [[Thorin|General Torin Oakenshield]].<ref name=""video""/>

The Princess got angry when [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] refused to accept his prophesied role of the dragon killer.

The '''Goblin Scribe''' was a physically disabled [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblin]] who served as a scribe, messenger, and possibly translator for the [[Great Goblin]].

== History ==
The Goblin Scribe was an offspring of the Great Goblin, but was never given any proper recognition by him because his mother was someone who his father would like to forget.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', ""...And Under Hill"", p. 182</ref> Due to the fact that he was born tiny with malformed legs and long fingernails, he was not a fighter and therefore served as a scribe, messenger, and possibly translator for his father. He took advantage of his long fingernails to take notes and write messages on parchment, moving around [[Goblin-town]] on a pulley with a seat attached to it.

When the Great Goblin received the notice of [[Azog|Azog's]] bounty on [[Thorin|Thorin's]] head, the Goblin Scribe possibly translated the bounty for his father from the [[Black Speech]] to [[Westron]].

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], when [[Thorin and Company|Thorin and his Company]] were captured at the [[Front Porch]] and brought before the Great Goblin, the Goblin Scribe was given orders by his father to write and send a letter, possibly in Black Speech, to inform the Pale Orc that Thorin and his Company were in Goblin-town.

The '''Keeper of the Dungeons''',<ref group=""note"">Despite appearing in the ending credits of ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', he was never given an actual name, thus making him one of the only two Orcs with a speaking role, along with the [[Orc Underling]] from ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', to have no known name.</ref> was an [[Orcs|Orc]] of [[Dol Guldur]] who served as the keeper of the [[Sauron|Necromancer's]] dungeons. The Keeper of the Dungeons was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Conan Stevens]].

== History ==
The Keeper of the Dungeons participated in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] where he fought [[Dwalin]] and was scarred in the encounter. Years later, during the [[Quest of Erebor]], the Keeper of the Dungeons was summoned by the [[Sauron|Necromancer]] to the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. He first spotted [[Gandalf]] hanging in a cage in Dol Guldur. He removed the cage, and then opened it to remove Gandalf. He then started interrogating Gandalf about the [[Three Rings]] for the [[Elves|Elven-kings]], and suddenly spotted [[Narya]] on one of the [[Wizards|Wizard's]] fingers. While attempting to claim it for his master, the Keeper is interrupted by the intruding [[Galadriel]], who blasts the orc to pieces, killing him.

== Other versions ==
Unlike the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], the Three Rings are never mentioned in the theatrical version and the Keeper of the Dungeons never noticed Narya on Gandalf's finger, though he still attempts to kill Gandalf, despite the reason never being mentioned in that version.

The appearance of the Keeper of the Dungeons was originally intended as an early design of [[Azog]], though the design was later reused for [[Bolg]], and even appeared as such in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/azog-bolg-and-yazneg-the-trios-tangled-design-history/|articlename=Azog, Bolg … and Yazneg: The trio’s tangled design history|dated=16 December 2013|accessed=17 June 2017|website=[http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com A Tolkienist Perspective]}}</ref> However, that idea was scrapped and the design was later re-purposed again for a third time to be the appearance of the Keeper of the Dungeons.

'''Halbrand''' was a name and identity that [[Sauron]] took for himself during the late [[Second Age]] of [[Middle-earth]]. Halbrand was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]. He'' is portrayed by [[Charlie Vickers]].<ref>{{webcite|author=The Lord of the Rings on Prime|articleurl=https://twitter.com/LOTRonPrime/status/1492169017741778944|articlename=Charlie Vickers is Halbrand. #LOTRROP|dated=11 February 2022|website=[https://twitter.com Twitter]|accessed=15 February 2023}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
Following the defeat of [[Morgoth]], Sauron rallies a gathering of [[Orcs]] to swear allegiance to him. An Uruk leader named [[Adar]] feigns that he is going to place the crown of Morgoth upon Sauron's head and swear fealty to him, but he stabs him with it instead. A struggle ensues in which Sauron fails to fight off a number of Orcs before he is overwhelmed and stabbed repeatedly. His bodily form is slain and his spirit flees.

Sauron slowly reconstitutes himself in a cave, forming a rudimentary and amorphous physical form. He uses this form to crawl out of the cave and eventually finds his way onto a horse drawn cart and appears to absorb the cart driver into his body. After this absorption, he is able to create a male human form that would come to be known as Halbrand.

=== Shipwreck ===
[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Halbrand poster.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Halbrand poster'' for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]

After encountering a group of [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]] led by [[Diarmid]] fleeing some unknown force, Halbrand joins them aboard a ship sailing through the [[Sundering Seas]]. That night, a nameless thing known only as the [[Nameless things|worm]] attacked the ship, forcing him onto a raft alongside [[Abigail]], [[Astrid (The Rings of Power)|Astrid]], [[Doble]], [[Eamon (The Rings of Power)|Eamon]], and two others. Eventually, after drifting for some time, they came upon the Elf [[Galadriel]], but the encounter was short-lived, as the worm returned to finish them off. Halbrand broke a section of the raft, abandoning the others before pulling Galadriel onto it and asking her where she wanted him to take her.

Soon afterwards, a storm came upon them and lightning struck the raft, causing Galadriel to fall into the water, being dragged down by a weighted pole. However, with some slight hesitation, Halbrand rescued her before they both lose consciousness.

=== Númenor ===
Eventually, their raft is discovered by [[Elendil|Captain Elendil]], who brings them to the [[Armenelos|capital]] of [[Númenor]], where they are presented to the [[Tar-Míriel|Queen Regent Míriel]]. When Galadriel aggressively makes demands of Míriel, Halbrand intervenes before things could escalate further, warning Galadriel to not make any enemies there.

With Galadriel restricted to the palace grounds, Halbrand explored the city and met a [[Guild of Weaponsmiths|smithy]] who told him that he must get a guild crest in order to work for him. Halbrand later encountered a group of guildsmen while eating and gets them drunk. In the process, he stole a guild crest belonging to a man named [[Tamar (The Rings of Power)|Tamar]]. Upon turning a corner assured of his victory, Halbrand is soon made aware that the guildsmen followed him. Despite trying to give back the crest, the guildsmen begin taking blows at him, provoking Halbrand into violently retaliating, severely wounding them. Upon being caught, he allowed himself to be arrested.

Galadriel soon visited him, giving him a scroll from the [[Hall of Lore]] identifying the insignia he wore as the emblem of the Kings of the Southlands. Halbrand revealed to her that he picked up the insignia on a dead man believing that it suited him. Galadriel refused to listen to him.

Eventually, Halbrand gets released and sets out to begin a new start at life working as a blacksmith's apprentice, presumably attaining a guild crest to be able to do so. He is later is forced by Galadriel to join the Númenórean expedition to Middle-earth to retake the Southlands from Orcs.

=== Southlands ===
Upon arriving at Middle-earth, Halbrand rode with the cavalry across the [[Ephel Dúath]] to the village of [[Tirharad]]. Though they deal easily with the Orcs, their leader, Adar, flees with Galadriel pursuing him. While riding, Halbrand seized a spear from a corpse, and maneuvering through the forest, he ended up riding towards where Adar was heading. Using the spear to trip the horse, Halbrand dismounted Adar, who attempted to provoke him into killing him, though Galadriel prevented Halbrand from doing so. Later, Halbrand returned the favor by preventing Galadriel from doing the same during her interrogation of Adar.

Afterwards, Míriel introduced Halbrand to [[Bronwyn]] and the villagers of Tirharad as the promised King of the Southlands. Shortly after, Tirharad is destroyed when [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] violently erupted. In the ensuing chaos, Halbrand received a serious wound to his abdomen, and was brought to the Númenórean camp outside of the affected region. Upon Galadriel's arrival, it was revealed that his wound required Elvish healing. While Halbrand declared that he still intended to retake the Southlands, he rode alongside Galadriel to [[Eregion]].

=== Sauron Revealed ===
At the [[Ost-in-Edhil|City of the Elven-smiths]], Halbrand recovered quickly and meets [[Celebrimbor|Lord Celebrimbor]] in his workshop, learning of [[Mithril]] and the struggles of the [[Elves]]. Halbrand managed to get Celebrimbor to overcome his despair, and to work on saving his race.

However, Galadriel confronted him about a genealogical scroll that revealed that the last King of the Southlands had died thousands of years ago with no heirs. Halbrand was thus forced to reveal his identity as Sauron, ruining his chance at receiving aid from others in redeeming himself of his past evil deeds. Halbrand effortlessly blocked Galadriel's subsequent attack, entering her mind to try to prove to her that he desired to redeem himself to heal Middle-earth and everything he did as a servant of [[Morgoth]].

Nevertheless, Galadriel refused to believe that he was redeemable and Halbrand fled Eregion, returning to the Southlands, newly-renamed to [[Mordor]].

=== Brief reappearance ===
During the [[Sack of Eregion]], Sauron briefly duels Galadriel on a mountaintop overlooking the city. During this battle, he assumes different forms to goad Galadriel. One of these forms is a clean-shaven Halbrand.[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Halbrand in Mordor.jpg|thumb|200px|''Halbrand in Mordor'' from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]

== Etymology ==
The show's writers have never revealed the etymology behind the name ''Halbrand''. It has been speculated that it could possibly be a [[Sindarin]] name comprised of the element ''[[Brand (word)|brand]]'' (""towering; tall and massive"") and the [[Noldorin]] ''[[hall]]'' (""exalted, high"").<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.theonering.com/tolkien-encyclopedia/halbrand/|articlename=Halbrand|dated=|website=[https://www.theonering.com/TheOneRing.com]|accessed=23 April 2024}}</ref> But it seems more likely that the name is derived from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:brand#Old English|brand]]'' (""fire-brand, torch; sword""),<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413 (discussion on name ''[[Erkenbrand]]'')</ref> since the Southlanders do not generally seem to have used [[Elvish]] names.

== Genealogy ==
There is a genealogical scroll that appears face up within the final episode, ''[[Alloyed]]'', at the following time stamps: 39:15, 40:26, 40:27, and 40:28. If a translation of it has been made, then please replace this note with it.

In Scene 22, the words that Halbrand, having already revealed himself as [[Sauron]], says to [[Galadriel]] are almost the same words that Galadriel says to [[Frodo Baggings|Frodo]] in the chapter '[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]', the seventh chapter of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring|first book]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novel.

Halbrand's apppearance as Sauron in the sea in Galadriel's mind seems to be inspired by Sauron's dark form as seen in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings film series]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit film series]] by [[Peter Jackson]].

<center>{{Quote|In truth little fear was seen in her face or her bearing. Tall and strong she seemed; for great stature were those of Hador's House...|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', ""[[The Journey of Morwen and Niënor to Nargothrond]]""}}</center>

'''Nienor''', also called '''Níniel''', was the second daughter of [[Húrin]] and [[Morwen]] and the sister of [[Túrin]]. Her father was a great foe of [[Morgoth]] and was cursed by the Dark Lord. That curse would also extend to his family, leading to some of the greatest tragedies of the [[First Age]].

==History==
Nienor was born in [[Dor-lómin]], a region in [[Hithlum]], during the year that the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (""The Battle of Unnumbered Tears"") was fought. In the aftermath of the battle, her father Húrin was captured, and the treacherous [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] had settled into the land of [[Dor-lómin]], oppressing the [[House of Hador|People of Hador]]. Fearing for her son's life, Morwen sent Túrin to the kingdom of [[Doriath]] for safety. As a result, Nienor never knew what her brother looked like.<ref name=""Departure"">{{CH|4}}</ref>

When Túrin had reached Doriath safely, [[Thingol]] had messengers sent to Dor-lómin to have Morwen and Nienor brought to Doriath. While Nienor remained with her mother in [[Dor-lómin]] due to Morwen's pride,<ref name=""Departure"" /> messengers brought tidings to Túrin of Morwen and Nienor and, as Túrin grew to be taller than many [[Elves]], Nienor grew to be ""a flower in the grey North"". For nine years this continued, until travel to and from Hithlum became more dangerous and Thingol stopped sending messengers, causing Túrin to fear that Morwen and Nienor had met some ill-fate.<ref name=""Doriath"">{{CH|5}}</ref>

Many years later, due to the actions of the mysterious [[Mormegil]] at [[Nargothrond]], Morgoth's grip over Hithlum was loosened, allowing Morwen and Nienor (whom the Easterling chieftain [[Lorgan]], having heard of her beauty, was eager to take by force)<ref name=""Wanderings"">{{WJ|Hurin}}, entry for the year 494, p. 256</ref> to escape at last to seek for Túrin in Doriath. Despite finding Túrin gone with no evidence of where he went, Morwen and Nienor were treated in Doriath with honor as the guests of [[Melian]] and Thingol.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref>

After the [[Fall of Nargothrond]], many survivors fled to Doriath, bringing many rumors which Nienor and her mother heard. Of which, they all claimed that the [[Mormegil]] was actually Túrin. Morwen intended to leave Nienor in Doriath while she journeyed out to seek the truth of Túrin's survival. Nienor wished to stop her mother, but Morwen had left before she could even try. A company of [[Elves]] led by [[Mablung]] set off on Thingol's orders to keep Morwen safe, yet none of them expected that Nienor would sneak into their company. Nienor had initially hoped that she could convince Morwen to turn back, but Morwen refused, and tried to command her to go back to Doriath, but Nienor rebuked her saying that she had a will of her own. In the end, Morwen relented, and Mablung brought them to [[Amon Ethir]] while he sought for tidings.<ref name=""Journey"" />

Unfortunately, the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Glaurung]] had just sacked the Elven city, and, sensing their approach, caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the river [[Narog]]. The guards and horses of Nienor and Morwen panicked fled, and Nienor was thrown from her horse, at which point she decided to not give into despair and climbed the Amon Ethir to gain a better perspective of the situation. Upon reaching the hilltop, Nienor found herself faced with the eyes of the golden head of Glaurung, who happened to have been climbing the other side. Upon the sight of Nienor, Glaurung forced her into revealing that she was the daughter of Húrin, after which he used his enchantments to draw a great darkness filled with emptiness upon Nienor, thrusting her suddenly into a state of total amnesia.<ref name=""Journey"" />

[[Image:John Howe - Nienor and Glaurung.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|''Nienor and Glaurung'' by [[John Howe]]]]

Eventually, [[Mablung]] had returned to Amon Ethir, and intended to take her back to Doriath, but despaired upon the next morning when Nienor stumbled and collapsed. Yet he regained his hope when three of the dispersed guards returned. Though their journey was slow, Nienor slowly regained some of her strength, yet her mind was still blank.<ref name=""Journey"" />

Eventually, after many days, they neared the western border of [[Doriath]], intending to cross the [[Taeglin]] by a guarded bridge near [[Esgalduin]]. When the Elves decided to rest there, they were caught unaware ""by a band of [[Orc-hunters]]"" that roamed the region. Upon waking in the confusion and terror, Nienor let out a cry if alarm and sped into the [[Forest of Brethil]] with the Orcs in pursuit. While the Elves quickly slew the orcs, Nienor was lost to them. Mablung and his company hunted far, between the [[Ered Wethrin]] and the [[Mouths of Sirion]], yet their search was in vain,<ref name=""Journey"" /> and Nienor fled deep into Brethil, tearing off her garments one by one, and running naked through the forest that whole day until she fainted into ""a deep brake of fern"" when evening came.<ref name=""Brethil"">{{CH|15}}</ref>

The next morning, she awoke with a darkness preventing her from remembering anything but a shadow of fear. This shadow of fear made her wary of her surroundings and, as a result, she always searched for ""hidings"", slipping into thickets or climbing trees whenever she became frightened, only going forth again after peering out long with shy eyes. While running in the direction that she first entered the forest, she crossed the river Taeglin after quenching her thirst. Yet she was still cold and famished, not being able to seek any food. Eventually, she stumbled upon a [[Haudh-en-Elleth|green mound]]. Upon sensing the darkness from her past catching up to her, she fell upon the mound, intending to rest, but was prevented when a ""black storm"" of great rain and lightning from the South came upon the forest. Terrified of the thunder, she lay cowering without words as the dark rain fell over her.<ref name=""Brethil"" />

In that same hour, a group of [[Haladin]] happened to be passing by, coming from a skirmish against Orcs heading to a shelter nearby. Upon a flash of lightning, they found her, naked and terrified, at the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]]. The leader of the group, a man named Turambar, lifted her up, gave up his cloak to her, and took her to the [[Hunters' lodge]] that they were heading to. When they reached the lodge, a fire was lit and the woodmen wrapped her in coverlets. Upon opening her eyes and glancing on Turambar, she felt comforted, sensing that he was someone from before her darkness. When Turambar asked her for her name, kin, and what evil she had faced, all she could do was shake her head and weep. After giving her food, Turambar asked her the questions again, this time assuring her that she was safe with them. But again, she only wept a second time. At this, Turambar assumed that her story was a sad one and ceased his questioning, giving her the name ""Níniel, Maid of Tears"". Responding, Níniel repeated the name, voicing her approval, saying her first word since her darkness. Níniel rested at the lodge that night before Turambar and the Haladin took her with them to their home upon [[Amon Obel]].<ref name=""Brethil"" />

Upon halting at [[Dimrost]], Níniel began shivering uncontrollably - so much so that the name was changed to ""Nen Girith, the Shuddering Water"". The woodmen quickened their pace as a result. However, before they reached [[Obel Halad]], Níniel caught a fever.<ref name=""Brethil"" />

As Níniel lay sick, [[Brandir]] tended to her, and she was watched day and night by the wives of the woodmen. Yet she was only ever able to lie in peace without moaning whenever Turambar was with her. All throughout her fever, everyone who watched her noticed that she never spoke a word in any language. Eventually, when she was healed and began to eat food again, the women of Brethil taught her word-for-word how to speak again.<ref name=""Brethil"" />

Níniel loved Turambar and, after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.

It was then that rumors of Glaurung's approach reached Turambar, who went out to slay him. The dragon cast a spell on Turambar as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Turambar fell into a swoon. At this moment, Níniel, who feared for her husband's life, arrived and found him apparently dead. The dying Glaurung then removed Níniel's amnesia with his last words, forcing her to confront the revelation that Turambar, the man who she had married, was her own brother Túrin, and that she was carrying his unborn child. Nienor threw herself into the gorge of [[Cabed-en-Aras]].

[[Image:Steamey - The last moments of Nienor.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''The last moments of Nienor'' by Steamey]]

When Túrin finally awoke, he was told of Nienor's fate by Brandir, but he refused to believe it, and slew him in anger. Then [[Mablung]] of Doriath arrived and corroborated Brandir's tale. In utter misery, Túrin killed himself on his sword [[Gurthang]].

Nienor's body was never found, but her name was written on the [[Stone of the Hapless]] beside her brother's. Years later, the poet [[Dírhaval]] composed the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' about the tragedy of the children of Húrin.<ref>{{UT|2n}}, p. 146</ref>

==Etymology==
''Nienor'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning ""Mourning"",<ref name=""Departure"" /> although the only clear element is ''[[nie]]'' (""tear""). In ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] chose to write Nienor's name as '''''Niënor'''''.<ref>{{CH|Names}}, p. 308</ref>

'''''Níniel''''' is [[Sindarin]] for ""Tear-maiden"",<ref name=""Brethil"" /> from ''[[nín]]'' (""tear"") + ''[[-iel]]'' (feminine suffix).

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an early pencilled preliminary draft fragment of the tale of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', Nienor was called '''Vainóni''', and her spell of forgetfulness was caused by a baneful drink given to her by [[Kurúki]], an evil magician that Vainóni and her mother, [[Mavwin|Tirannë]], stumble across,<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, pp. 138-9</ref> though the spell was broken by [[Glaurung]] as it is in later versions. Vainóni's name was soon changed to '''Nienóri''' in the actual text of the ''Tale of Turambar and the Foalókë''.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, passim</ref>

'''Beleg Cúthalion''' was a [[Sinda]] who served King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] of [[Doriath]]. He was considered to be the best archer and huntsman of his time. He became a friend and brother-in-arms of [[Túrin]], before falling victim to the [[úmarth]] surrounding Túrin.

==History==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Beleg.jpg|thumb|right|Beleg in Taur-nu-Fuin (later interpreted as a Hobbit), from ""[[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Fangorn Forest.jpg|Fangorn Forest]]"" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]

Together with [[Mablung]], Beleg was one of the great captains of the [[Sindar]]. Beleg was captain of the [[Marchwardens]] and therefore was usually on duty on Doriath's northern borders near [[Brethil]], [[Dimbar]] and [[Nan Dungortheb]]. Beleg carried a black bow named [[Belthronding]], to which his [[epessë]] (surname) referred, and an arrow called [[Dailir]].

In {{FA|458}},<ref>{{GA|160}}. pp. 56-7</ref> following the capture of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] upon [[Tol Sirion]] by [[Sauron|Gorthaur]], a legion of Orcs invaded [[East Beleriand]], coming down through the [[Pass of Sirion]], and fought the [[Haladin]] near [[Brethil]]. To this battle Beleg brought a great strength of Elves armed with axes and bows, and issuing from the forest, they took the Orcs by surprise and utterly destroyed their host. This, for a while, stemmed the tide coming from the North, as enemies did not dare cross the [[Taeglin]] for many years after.<ref name=""Bragollach"" />

He took part in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]], together with King Thingol, Mablung, [[Beren|Beren Ercharmion]] and the great hound [[Huan]].

Along with Mablung, he was among the only Iathrim who joined the hosts of the Noldor in [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===With Túrin===
Later, he became a good friend and brother-in-arms of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], and thus became ensnared in Túrin's accursed fate. For a long time Túrin joined Beleg in Dimbar.

When Túrin fled from [[Doriath]], Beleg received permission from Thingol to follow him into exile and give his pardon to return. He deemed his bow unsuited for this task and from Thingol's armoury chose the sword [[Anglachel]] that [[Eöl]] had forged and given to Thingol in tribute. He took it despite Melian's warnings that the sword possessed the malice of its creator. 

Beleg was captured by the [[Gaurwaith|band of outlaws]] Túrin led near [[Amon Rûdh]] and was tortured, because Túrin was not present. He brought word from Thingol to Túrin that he was free to return to Doriath, but Túrin neglected the offer. After returning to Thingol to bring the news, Beleg returned into the north marches; when winter came, he set out again to join Túrin.<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref>

The outlaws had meanwhile taken about at [[Bar-en-Danwedh]], the halls of [[Mîm]], the [[Petty-dwarf]]. 

Together with Túrin, Beleg became for a while [[Two Captains|a captain]] of the Outlaws against [[Morgoth]]. The place where they dwelt became known as [[Dor-Cúarthol]], the ""Land of Bow and Helm"". Beleg healed [[Andróg]] from an arrow wound, causing the hatred of Mîm who not only hated the Elves, but also because Andróg was his enemy. When Mîm was captured by Orcs, he didn't hesitate to reveal where the outlaws had their refuge. 

After fierce battle upon the top of Amon Rûdh all men were slain and Túrin captured. Beleg was bound and left back alive, as was demanded by Mîm who wanted to deal with the Elf personally. But Andróg was still alive, though mortally wounded, and he chased Mîm away and cut through Beleg's bonds before dying.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref>

===Death===
Beleg followed the [[Orcs]] into [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], where he met [[Gwindor]], an Elf of [[Nargothrond]] who had been captured in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad but escaped from slavery in Morgoth's mines. With help from Gwindor, who had seen the passing by Orc-band, Beleg found the Orc-camp at night. He shot one by one the [[wolves]] who guarded the camp. He then was able to rescue Túrin, who was unconscious because of the torture he had endured, during a thunderstorm.

Beleg carried Túrin away from the camp and cut his bonds with his sword. But the blade slipped away and cut into Túrin's flesh. Awaking suddenly and filled with terrible memories of past torture, Túrin only perceived a shape bent over him with a blade and believed the Orcs were about to torture him again. Finding his hands unbound, in a sudden rage of self-defence, Túrin wrested Anglachel from Beleg and killed him.

Beleg was buried along with his bow Belthronding by Túrin and Gwindor. Anglachel had turned black and blunt when it spilled its master's blood. But Gwindor took it with him, for he deemed it better to use the blade for vengeance against Morgoth, than to leave it rotting in the earth.<ref name=""Death"">{{CH|9}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Once recovered of the shock of killing Beleg, Túrin made a song for him, named ''[[Laer Cú Beleg]]'', the Song of the Great Bow.<ref name=""Death"" /> Years later, Túrin faced his destiny in [[Cabed-en-Aras]], commiting suicide after addressing Gurthang, which answered him mentioning his past crime:

{{Blockquote|Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>}}

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Beleg Cuthalion.mp3|Ardamir}}
''[[Beleg (word)|beleg]]'' is a [[Sindarin]] word meaning ""great, mighty; large, big"".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''beleg''</ref>

His [[epessë]] ''Cúthalion'' is Sindarin for ""Strongbow"", from ''[[cú]]'' (""bow"") + ''[[thalion]]'' (""strong, dauntless"").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''cú'', ''thalion''</ref>

'''Beren Erchamion''' was a renowned [[Men|Mannish]] hero of the [[House of Bëor]] during the [[First Age]].

His romance with the [[Elves|Elf]] [[Lúthien]], and their [[Quest for the Silmaril|Quest]] to obtain a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of [[Morgoth]], was one of the [[Atanatárion|great tales]] of the [[Elder Days]].<ref name=""S19"">{{S|19}}</ref>

==History==
===Life in Dorthonion===
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Beren Gamlost heraldic device.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Beren Gamlost's heraldic device by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
Beren was the son of [[Barahir]] and [[Emeldir]] and was named after [[Beren (son of Belemir)|Beren, his maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref> He was a Man of the royal [[House of Bëor]] of [[Dorthonion]] for his father was most likely the last Chieftain of the House of Bëor. The [[Dagor Bragollach]] (""Battle of Sudden Flame"") befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his land. The young Beren lived with his father and ten loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the twelve of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of [[Morgoth]], the Dark Lord of [[Angband]]. But due to the treachery of [[Gorlim the Unhappy]], Barahir's [[Barahir's outlaws|outlaws]] in [[Dorthonion]] were slain at the hands of the [[Orcs]] of [[Sauron]]. Beren swore an oath to avenge his father. But he ""wept not, for his heart was ice"".<ref>{{LB|C2}}</ref> He slew the orcs responsible for the death of his people and recovered from them the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name=""S19"" />

Living as an outlaw, his daring feats won renown throughout the free world, and earned the hatred of Morgoth, who set upon his head a bounty. Thus, he was forced to abandon the land of his birth and the grave of his father. He passed through the horrors of [[Nan Dungortheb]] by paths traversed by no other elves or men, and came into [[Doriath]], where he met and fell in love with Lúthien — princess of the [[Sindar]], and daughter of [[Thingol]], King of Doriath and [[Melian]] the [[Maia]] — upon seeing her dancing in the woods of [[Neldoreth]], and she loved him too.<ref name=""S19"" />

===Quest for the Silmaril===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Beren leaves Menegroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Beren leaves Menegroth'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
{{Main|Quest for the Silmaril}}
Thingol refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage, as Beren was a mortal. He charged Beren that he would allow the marriage to take place only if he brought back a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren was determined. He set out on his quest with the aid of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] of [[Nargothrond]], but was soon captured by [[Sauron]] and imprisoned in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. There Finrod succumbed to death, at the hands of the wolves of Sauron, saving the life of Beren with his dying act. Lúthien, along with [[Huan]] the great hound, eventually came to his rescue, and they departed that place. Near to [[Brethil]], they were ambushed by two of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the latter of whom had swept Lúthien up into his saddle. To rescue her, Beren carried out his [[Leap of Beren|leap of renown]] to the steed of Curufin. Stripping him of his horse and knife, [[Angrist]], Beren bade the two brothers be gone. Curufin fired arrows at Lúthien as they fled, and Beren was hit. He was nursed back to health by Lúthien and Huan.<ref name=""S19"" />

[[Image:Ted_Nasmith_-_Transformed.jpg|thumb|''Transformed'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After a time, Beren continued upon his quest. Leaving Lúthien in the care of Huan, he travelled to the borders of [[Anfauglith]] and despairing, there sung the [[Song of Parting]]. Unlooked for, Lúthien and Huan heard his lament and came to him, and Beren tried to dissuade her from joining his quest, but then Huan spoke, counselling that their fates were now entwined. Then, disguising themselves as fell servants of Sauron, they crossed leagues of desert, ashes and dust until they came to the [[Gates of Angband]].<ref name=""S19"" />

Using Lúthien's powers to place Morgoth's court into a deep sleep, they were able to enter Angband where Beren cut a Silmaril from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf [[Carcharoth]], whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand, swallowing it along with the Silmaril, and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Thus Beren was called '''''Erchamion''''', ""One-handed"". Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of [[Manwë]]. Coming back to Thingol's court, both told him the tale of their quest and how Beren had fulfilled Thingol's demand, as he had one Silmaril in his hand. Thus, Thingol relented, and Beren and Lúthien were married; this was the first [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]].
Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Huan was slain and Beren was mortally wounded.<ref name=""S19"" />

Succumbing to grief over the death of her beloved, Lúthien died, and her soul fled to the [[Halls of Mandos]], where she moved [[Mandos]] to pity. So it came to pass that Lúthien and Beren were granted a life together in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""S19"" /> Both she and Beren were restored to life, but both of them would die the mortal death of Men, and go beyond the walls of [[Arda]] to the  unknown [[Doom of Men]].<ref name=""doriath"">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
{{Quote|(...) and whether the second span of his life was brief or long is not known to Elves or Men|''The Lost Road and Other Writings'', ""VI. Quenta Silmarillion""}}
Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on [[Tol Galen]] in the middle of the [[Adurant|River Adurant]] in [[Ossiriand]]. There they stayed apart from other mortals. Lúthien bore Beren a son, named [[Dior]], Thingol's heir.<ref name=""S20"" /> He was considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, the blood of Elves, and the blood of the [[Ainur]]. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]].
[[File:Turner Mohan - Beren and Luthien.jpg|thumb|''Beren and Luthien'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]

The taking of the Silmaril from Angband by Beren and Lúthien led [[Maedhros]], the eldest of the [[sons of Fëanor]] to lead a [[Union of Maedhros|union]] of Elves and Men in an assault upon Angband in the ill-fated [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. It was here that Morgoth gained a greater control over Beleriand and where [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]] was taken prisoner to Angband.<ref name=""S20"">{{S|20}}</ref>

Beren was involved with the events of the [[First Age]] only one further time. After the murder of Thingol, [[Mablung]] was sent by Melian to warn Beren. He gathered the [[Green-elves]], and with the aid of some [[Ents]]<ref>{{L|248}}</ref> they waylaid a group of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] who had [[battle in the Thousand Caves|destroyed]] Doriath and stolen its treasures. They ambushed the Dwarves and vanquished them in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]]. Because the [[Naugladur|Lord of Nogrod]] cursed the treasure, Beren threw it in the river [[Ascar]], but salvaged the [[Nauglamir]] which he brought to his wife. Their son Dior left to restore and rule [[Menegroth]].<ref name=""doriath"" />

Beren and Lúthien died together on Tol Galen. Among the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] the final death of Beren and Lúthien is accounted in {{FA|503}}, for in the Autumn of that year Dior received the Silmaril in Doriath, and it was taken as a sign of his parents' death. In truth the date of their death is unknown.<ref name=""doriath"" /><ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 306</ref>

==Characteristics==
Beren had golden-brown hair and grey eyes. He was taller than most of his kinsmen, but (according to the trait of his House) he was broad-shouldered, and his limbs were very strong.<ref name=""n46"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Beren Erchamion.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Beren'' is glossed as ""bold"" in [[Noldorin]] of ''[[The Etymologies]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root ""[[BER]]""</ref>

==Other names==
His epithet '''''Erchamion''''' means ""one-handed"".<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp. 51, 231</ref> Its [[Quenya]] cognate was '''''Ercambo'''''.<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 8</ref> It has been suggested that '''''Camlost''''' means ""empty-handed"". Both epithets contain [[Sindarin]] ''cam'' (""hand"").<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''cam''</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first pencilled draft of the story of Beren and Lúthien, Beren was a mortal Man.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.52"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 52</ref> However, Tolkien erased it and wrote the ""[[Tale of Tinúviel]]"" of the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' over it. In this version, Beren was an Elf: one of the [[Gnomes]] of [[Dor-lómin]], the son of [[Egnor bo-Rimion]] the Forester.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.11"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 11</ref> 

He arrived in [[Artanor]] (an early form of Doriath) and saw Tinúviel (the early name of Lúthien) as in the later work, although the backstory regarding the outlaws of Barahir is absent in the early tale. The displeasure of King [[Tinwelint]] against him was because the [[Dark Elves]] of [[Artanor]] considered those Elves treacherous.<ref>{{BL|Introduction}}</ref> After being sent to obtain a Silmaril by Tinwelint, Beren heads directly to [[Angamandi]], and is captured by orcs and brought before [[Melko]]<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel pp.14-5"">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 14-5</ref> rather than going to seek the aid of King Finrod Felagund. Throughout this early tale, the entire ""Nargothrond element"" is absent.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.53"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 53</ref> Instead of being imprisoned in Tol-in-Gaurhoth by Sauron, Beren is put to work as a scullion in the kitchens of [[Tevildo]], Prince of Cats, a very early narrative forerunner to Sauron.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.54"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 54</ref> Upon his rescue from the castle of Tevildo by Tinúviel, he emerged with a kitchen knife<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.29"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 29</ref> which he later used to cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Melko.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.33"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 33</ref> This weapon is used in place of Angrist, since the encounter with Celegorm and Curufin is absent in this early tale. 

After obtaining the Silmaril, the jewel and the hand of Beren were bitten off by the wolf Karkaras (an early name for Carcharoth).<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p.34"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 34</ref> Beren and Tinúviel then fled and were found by Huan, who brought them to Artanor.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel pp.35-7"">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 35-7</ref> This contrasts with the rescue of Beren and Lúthien from the gates of Angband by Thorondor and the [[Eagles]] in the published version of [[The Silmarillion]]; Christopher Tolkien remarks that ""far more is made of the healing of Beren's wound"" in the final work.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel p. 58"">{{LT2|In}}, p. 58</ref>

The death of Beren in the early tale follows a similar story arc, however Christopher Tolkien discusses the consequences of Beren's Elvish nature in the early tale here.<ref name=""LT2 Tinuviel pp. 59-60"">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 59-60</ref>

==Inspiration==
The story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was a central part of the [[Legendarium]]. Tolkien once referred to it as ""the kernel of the mythology"".<ref>{{L|165}}</ref> He went on to say that it ""arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks'"", which he visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during [[World War I]]).

Tolkien seemed to be somehow connected to this character, and parallels can be drawn with his relationship with [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]]. Furthermore it is possible that ''Beren'' (meaning 'brave') is a reference to the original meaning of his Germanic surname (Toll kühn) of similar meaning. It is said that, like the story of Lúthien dancing in the woods before Beren, that one day while Tolkien and his wife were on a picnic in the woods she danced for him, thus creating another parallel to Beren and Luthien. 

Tolkien was buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] (North [[Oxford]]) and this name appears on the stone:

:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 – 1973

The name of Lúthien also appears on the stone:

:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971



[[John Garth]] has theorized that the name Beren could have originally come from Beren’s Hill in [[Wikipedia:South Oxfordshire|South Oxfordshire]].<ref name=""VanityFair"">{{webcite|authorJohn Garth|articleurl=https://steadyhq.com/en/john-garth-on-tolkiens-life-and-works/posts/40c3274b-ffc1-4c1e-aba4-547f4d15bd6b?utm_campaign=steady_sharing_button|articlename=Where did Tolkien’s Silmarillion hero Beren get his name?|dated=22-March-2024|website=Steady|accessed=23-March-2024}}</ref>{{references}}

'''Varda Elentári''', known in [[Sindarin]] as '''Elbereth Gilthoniel''', was a [[Valar|Valië]], one of the [[Aratar]], the wife of [[Manwë]] and Queen of the Valar. 

==Attributes==
Varda knew all the regions of [[Eä]] and rejoiced in light. She was said to be too beautiful for words, as within her face radiated the light of [[Ilúvatar]]. [[Elves]] loved and revered her most of all the Valar because she created the stars, which the Elves beheld when they first awoke. They called upon her in their hours of deepest darkness.<ref name=""vala"" /> She appeared in shining white ''[[fana]]'' in visions to the Elves of [[Middle-earth]], and thus was called [[Fanuilos]] (Snow-white).<ref name=""AElbereth"">{{RGEO|7}}, p. 66</ref> 

Her handmaiden was [[Ilmarë]], a Chief of the [[Maiar]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

==History==
Before the [[Music of the Ainur]], Varda saw [[Melkor]]'s mind, and rejected him. Melkor feared and hated Varda the most out of all the Valar. In the beginning, Melkor had been unable to control light, which Varda was most associated with. When Manwë [[First War|contested]] with him for [[Arda]], Varda came from the deeps of Eä to his side.<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIb}}</ref>
[[File:Jerrel Salvatierra - Varda, Lady of the Stars.jpg|left|thumb|''Varda, Lady of the Stars'' by [[:Category:Images by Jerrel Salvatierra|Jerrel Salvatierra]]]]
During the [[Spring of Arda]], she filled the [[Two Lamps]] with light. After their destruction at the hands of Melkor, Varda and the rest of the Ainur forsook the outer lands and removed to Aman.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>

She resided with Manwë in [[Ilmarin]] and aided him in the rule of Arda. With her, Manwë saw beyond all eyes, through mist and darkness, and with him, Varda heard all voices from every corner of the world.<ref name=""vala"" /> In [[Valinor]], she kept the dews of the [[Two Trees]] in [[Wells of Varda|her Wells]]. When the Valar felt that the [[Awakening of the Elves]] was near, [[Mandos]] foretold that the Elves would see the stars first and how they would always look to Varda in reverence. Then Varda gazed the darkness in Middle-earth from Taniquetil and began the greatest work made by the Valar since their coming into Arda: taking the dew from the vats of [[Telperion]], she created new and brighter stars. She set many individual [[stars]], but also [[constellations]], the [[Sickle of the Valar]] among them. A long time took this labours, and once they were finished, the Elves awoke in Middle-earth and they beheld first the stars which Varda had made. For this, Varda was the Vala most loved and revered by the Elves.<ref name=""Captivity"">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Vessels.jpg|thumb|''Vessels'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]
She also hallowed the [[Silmarils]] of [[Fëanor]] when he created them, so that any being or creature of evil could never handle them without being burned.<ref>{{S|7}}</ref> 

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Varda was tasked once again with filling the world with a new light. Therefore she took the remaining flower of [[Telperion]] and the fruit of [[Laurelin]] and placed them in vessels made by [[Aulë]]. Varda bequeathed to them such light and power that they outshone the ancient stars. In doing so, she established the courses of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. Initially she purposed the Sun and the Moon to be in the sky together, but [[Irmo]] and [[Estë]] pointed out that she had deprived the world of night-time and the stars, which was still necessary for rest and sleep. Therefore Varda changed her counsel and altered the courses of the Sun so that it should spend a certain time hidden, allowing for the stars to be seen again.<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

At the decree of Manwë that [[Hiding of Valinor|Valinor was to be hidden]], Varda lifted her hands, palms eastward in a gesture of rejection, and summoned the vast mists and shadows that made it impossible for any living thing to find again the way westward to the shores of Valinor.<ref name=""PE17"">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp| 175}}

At the end of the [[First Age]], she placed [[Eärendil]] as a [[Star of Eärendil|star]] in the sky.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

In [[Middle-earth]], she was revered by the Elves who called her name and sung hymns to her (such as the [[Elven Hymn to Elbereth]]) and perhaps answered to prayers, even to [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{TT|Lair}}</ref> The very mention of her name was said to be deadly to evil spirits, such as when Frodo uttered the name in the presence of the Morgul Lord.

==Etymology==
''Varda'' is a [[Quenya]] name of [[Valarin]] origin meaning ""Sublime"",<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 402</ref> ""Exalted""<ref name=""Namarie"">{{RGEO|5}}, p. 61</ref> or ""Lofty"".<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 282</ref> It comes from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''baradâ'', from the [[root]] [[BARAT|BARAD]], being actually a honorific title used as a name.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 22, 65</ref>

In the early [[Qenya]], ''Varda'' comes from the same root as ''vard-'' (""rule, govern"") or ''varni'' (""queen"").<ref name=""Varda"">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Varda""</ref>

==Other names==
*'''''Elbereth''''' her usual [[Sindarin]] name, being more or less equivalent to '''''Elentári''''' (""Star-Queen"") in Quenya.<ref name=""AElbereth"">{{RGEO|7}}, p. 66</ref> ''Elbereth'' derives from Primitive Quendian *''[[elen]]-barathî'', being notable that ''[[bereth]]'' means ""spouse"", used for one who is ""queen"" of a king.<ref name=""Elbereth"">{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 22-23</ref>
*'''''Tintallë''''', given to her after she kindled new brighter stars with the dew of Telperion, meaning ""Star-kindler""<ref name=""Captivity"" /> or ""she that causes sparkling, kindles lights"".<ref name=""Namarie"" /> Its cognates were '''''Gilthoniel''''' in Sindarin<ref name=""Elbereth"" /> and '''''Gimilnitîr''''' in [[Adûnaic]].<ref name=""Adunaic"">{{SD|3vi5}}, p. 428</ref>
*'''''Fanuilos''''', another Sindarin title, which is inadequately rendered as ""Snow-white""<ref name=""AElbereth"">{{RGEO|7}}, p. 66</ref> or ""Everwhite"".<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 278</ref> Being a combination of ''[[fan]]'' (""white cloud, shape, vision"") + ''Uilos'' (the Sindarin name for [[Oiolossë]]) would more precisely mean ""Figure (bright and majestic) upon Uilos"".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 26</ref>
*'''''Avradî''''', her name in [[Adûnaic]].<ref name=""Adunaic"" />
*'''''Airë Tári''''', Quenya title for ""Holy Queen"".<ref name=""Shibb"">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 363-364, note 45</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
In the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', she is called ''Varda'' in [[Qenya]], and '''''Bridhil''''' in [[Gnomish]].<ref name=""Varda"" /> Her main title ""Queen of Stars"" is rendered in Qenya as '''''Tinwetári''''', while its [[Gnomish]] cognates were '''''Tinturwin''''', '''''Timbridhil''''', '''''Gailbridh(n)ir'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Tinwetári""</ref> She is also called '''''Súlimi''''' as the wife of Manwë Súlimo, while both together are called '''''[[Wanwavoisi]]'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Súlimo""</ref>

In narrative she is referred as Varda '''the Beautiful'''. She became the wife of Manwë, the Lord of the [[Gods]], and they had two [[Valarindi|children]]: [[Úrion]] and [[Erinti]].<ref>{{LT1|II}}, pp. 58-59</ref> During the [[Music of the Ainur]], she was the one who thought most on white and silver [[light]], and on stars. When she and Manwë entered the new world, they arose with wings of power that they gathered to travel through [[Vaitya]], [[Ilwë]] and [[Vilna]], the three airs. With them came many [[spirits]] of the airs that loved them, the [[Mánir]] and the [[Súruli]]. In those first days there were dispersed lights flowing through all the airs, and while she was playing in the sky, Varda set a few stars. When [[Aulë]] and [[Melko]] began making [[Two Lamps|two lamps]] to illuminate all the regions of the world, Manwë and Varda gathered a vast amount of the light, and kindled the lamps with it. After the lamps were destroyed and the Valar built their realm, Varda proposed to gather all the light that remained in the airs and spilled in the earth to make a beacon upon [[Taniquetil]], but instead the light was gathered in two cauldrons: [[Kulullin and Silindrin]]. To help [[Palúrien]] to make the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], two holes were opened next to the cauldrons and there were buried many magical things brought by the Valar, Varda contributing with a small star in the silver pit.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 65-66, 69-71</ref>

Years later, when Manwë informed her that the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves had awoken]], Varda rose joyfully and went to [[Valmar]], where Aulë was working with a basin full of light from the silver cauldron. Hearing the news, the Vala struck his hammer, creating silver sparks. Then Varda took the sparks and mixed them with the light of the basin and molten silver. With this, she flew to the sky and set a lot of new stars of great glory and slumbering power, like [[Morwinyon]]. Later, during the council of the Valar, she supported the idea of the [[Eldar]] coming to Valinor, as she always had the greatest love for them.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, pp. 113-114, 117</ref>
[[File:Lída Holubová - Varda.jpg|thumb|''Varda'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]

===Later versions===
In his last conceptions for his legendarium, [[Tolkien]] considered that the solar system was already created when the Valar entered into Eä. Their power would be limited to [[Arda]] and therefore the Stars would not be of their concern. In this version Varda did not create the Stars, at least not in general, but her concern acquires a new dimension, as she is the keeper of the [[Light of Valinor|Primeval Light]].<ref name=""Light"">{{MR|P5II}}, pp. 375-377, 380-381</ref>

{{blockquote|Therefore Ilúvatar, at the entering of the Valar into Eä, added a theme to the [[Music of the Ainur|Great Song]] which was not in it at the first Singing, and he called one of the Ainur to him. Now this was that Spirit which afterwards became Varda (and taking female form became the spouse of Manwë). To Varda Ilúvatar said: 'I will give unto thee a parting gift. Thou shalt take into Eä a light that is holy, coming new from Me, unsullied by the thought and lust of Melkor, and with thee it shall enter into Eä, and be in Eä, but not of Eä.' Wherefore Varda is the most holy and revered of all the Valar, and those that name the light of Varda name the love of Eä that Eru has, and they are afraid, less only to the name of the One.}}

Later, after the [[First War]], Varda gave Ari ([[Arien]]) a portion of the blessed light to inhabit the Sun, but the Maia is ravished by Melkor and the blessed light was lost.<ref name=""Light"" /> However, the original light of the Sun and Moon had been used to kindle the Two Trees.<ref>{{MR|P5V}}, p. 390</ref>

Although Varda did not create the Stars, it is said that she designed the patterns of the main constellations as prophetic signs for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]. However, she is still called ""Star-kindler"", for she made a great dome above Valinor to protect the airs from the spirits of Melkor. This dome was a ''[[Nur-menel]]'' (lesser firmament), a simulacrum of the true firmament (''[[Tarmenel]]''), and had very bright stars.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ""[Text] III"" and ""[Text] IV"", pp. 385-388</ref>

==Inspiration==
The Valar, being divine beings below the ultimate Creator, [[Ilúvatar]], are thought of as being the [[Middle-earth]] equivalent of angels;<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> it has therefore been suggested that Varda, in her role as the most loved and prayed-to Vala, may be an equivalent of the Virgin Mary in Tolkien's own Catholic faith.<ref>{{webcite|author=Lawrence Yuen|articleurl=https://themythpilgrim.com/2020/12/16/mary-in-lotr/|articlename=15: Mary in Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings|dated=16 December 2020|website=The Myth Pilgrim|accessed=18 March 2024}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Tuttle|articleurl=https://voyagecomics.com/2021/11/12/is-tolkiens-varda-the-best-representation-of-mary-in-middle-earth/#:~:text=In%20Tolkien%27s%20legendarium%2C%20she%20is,the%20text%20of%20The%20Silmarillion.|articlename=Is Tolkien’s “Varda” the best representation of Mary in Middle-Earth?|dated=12 November 2021|website=Voyage Comics (Blog)|accessed=18 March 2024}}</ref> Another suggestion is the goddess of wisdom, [[Wikipedia:Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], also associated with the stars.<ref>Rose Thomas, ""Is Varda the Wisdom of Eru?"", in ''[[Amon Hen 245|''Amon Hen'' 245]]'', pp. 15-16</ref>

'''Nori''' was one of [[Durin's Folk]] and likely dwelt in the northern [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the latter had settled there.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He was one of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Nori lived with his share of the treasure at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
===Family and birth===
Nori's parentage is unknown, although he was a remote kinsman of Thorin and a member of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name=""Durin""/> He was also the brother of [[Dori]], and a cousin of [[Ori]].<ref name=Person /> His birth year is also unknown. 

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was ""the eldest left"".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=""Durin""/> this would put Nori's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

===The Quest of Erebor===
Nori  was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  He wore a purple hood.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Nori (along with Dori and Ori) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  In Beorn's Halls, when [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Nori and Ori were the second two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Nori fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor alongside with Dori and Ori.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Nori lived a wealthy life after the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. His date of death is unknown but he was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=""Meetings""/>

==Etymology==
''Nóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It most likely means ""Little shaver, small bit of something"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The '''Blue Wizards''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] '''''Ithryn Luin''''')<ref group=""note"">The term ""Blue Wizards"" is mentioned only in an ""essay"" and is the only source where they are assigned a colour; although Tolkien revisited the concept of the remaining two Wizards, giving them different names and backgrounds, their assigned colour (whether blue or other) or title, is never specified again. However the term ""Blue Wizards"" is used by the fans to refer to all concepts of these two Wizards.</ref> were the two [[Wizards]] (''Istari)'' who were sent into the far [[Rhun|East]] and [[Harad|South]] of [[Middle-earth]] to contest the will of [[Sauron]], but never returned.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] conception of the two Blue Wizards changed dramatically between his earlier and later writings.
===Earlier writings===
The idea that there were two other [[Wizards]] in addition to [[Gandalf]], [[Saruman]], and [[Radagast]] was first conceived when Saruman, in his wrath, revealed that there were five members of the Order of Wizards:
{{Blockquote|Later! Yes, when you [Gandalf] also have the [[Keys of Barad-dûr]] itself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards...|[[Saruman]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', ""[[The Voice of Saruman]]""}}

Nothing more was said of these two Wizards in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as it was published. However, whilst preparing (in [[1954]]) an index for ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Tolkien wrote what his [[Christopher Tolkien|son]] later referred to as the 'essay on the Istari'. There it is said that of the chief Wizards who went to the North of [[Middle-earth]] there were five, and two of these were clad in sea-blue. Little was known about these two in the West of Middle-earth; even their individual names were unknown, but they were known collectively as ''Ithryn Luin'', or ""Blue Wizards"". It is said they travelled into the East with Curunír (Saruman), but they did not return into the West. Their fate was unknown, but some held that they fell into evil and became servants of [[Sauron]].<ref name=""UTIstari"">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

Tolkien expanded upon this last point in a letter written in [[1958]]: 
{{Blockquote|I really do not know anything clearly about the other two [wizards] – since they do not concern the history of the N[orth].W[est]. I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Númenórean range: missionaries to 'enemy-occupied' lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.|[[Letter 211]]<ref name=""Letter211"">{{L|211}}</ref>}}

[[File:Tom Cross - Alatar - Darkness-slayer.jpg|thumb|''Alatar: Darkness-slayer'' by Tom Cross<ref group=""note"">Tolkien did not associate Alatar with Morinehtar (which means ""Darkness-slayer"") and they should not be considered synonymous.</ref>]]

Tolkien also suggests that only Gandalf returned to [[Valinor]]:

{{Blockquote|Wilt thou learn the lore <nowiki>||</nowiki> that was long secret<br/>of the Five that came <nowiki>||</nowiki> from a far country?<br/>One only returned. <nowiki>||</nowiki> Others never again|''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ""[[The Istari]]""<ref name=""UTIstari""/>}}

In a brief narrative about a council of the [[Valar]], the origins of the other two Wizards are placed alongside those of the known three, Curumo (Saruman), [[Radagast|Aiwendil]] (Radagast), and Olórin (Gandalf). Whilst in the essay on the Istari the Blue Wizards were given no names, here these two are called Alatar and Pallando. [[Oromë]] chose Alatar to send to Middle-earth (to contest the will of Sauron), and Alatar decided to bring along Pallando as his friend. Christopher Tolkien has speculated that their association with Oromë could be because he was the Vala who had the greatest knowledge of the furthest regions of Middle-earth, and hence that is where the two Wizards journeyed.<ref name=""UTIstari"" />

[[File:Angus McBride - Pallando.jpg|''Pallando'' by [[Angus McBride]]|thumb]]

Based on the above material, the history of the two ""Blue Wizards"" can be determined as the following:

*[[Manwë]] summons a council of the Valar. They decide to send emissaries to Middle-earth. Oromë chooses to send Alatar, and Alatar brings along his friend Pallando.<ref name=""UTIstari"" />
** Notably, Pallando was originally affiliated with [[Mandos]] and [[Nienna]], though this was emended to Oromë.<ref name=""UTIstari"" />
*The two Wizards arrive in Middle-earth at roughly the same time as the other wizards, c. {{TA|1000}}<ref name=""AppB2"">{{App|B2}}</ref>
*The two, known as the ""Blue Wizards"", travel into the East of Middle-earth with Saruman. Saruman returns to the North-West, but the two do not.<ref name=""UTIstari"" />
*Together or independent of each other, the two fall from their appointed task. They may have founded ""magic"" cults amongst the peoples of the East and South, which existed beyond the downfall of Sauron.<ref name=""Letter211"" />

===Later writings===
[[File:Jef Murray - Slayer of Darkness.jpg|''Slayer of Darkness'' by [[Jef Murray]]|thumb]]

Towards the end of his life, Tolkien returned to the issue of the other two Wizards. In a brief outline he noted that the two Wizards were sent to [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Second Age]] and were destined to disrupt the work of [[Sauron]] in the East:

{{Blockquote|Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of [[Men]] that had rebelled from [[Melkor]]-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [?dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]] in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.|""[[Last Writings]]"", ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''<ref name=""PMLast"">{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-85</ref>}}

Therefore, Tolkien dramatically altered his conception of the two [[Wizards]]. They no longer arrived in Middle-earth along with [[Saruman]], [[Gandalf]], and [[Radagast]] in c. {{TA|1000}}. Instead they arrived much earlier, at roughly the same time as [[Glorfindel]] in c. {{SA|1600}}. Whilst Glorfindel was tasked with aiding [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] with the war in [[Eriador]], the Wizards were destined to journey to the East. Instead of mentioning that they drifted from their mission, Tolkien points out that they played a decisive role in the downfall of Sauron at the end of both the [[Second Age]] and the [[Third Age]]. They were known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, ""Darkness-slayer"" and ""East-helper"", and were successful in preventing the forces of the East from outnumbering those of the [[Free peoples]] in the West.<ref name=""PMLast"" />

Additionally, Tolkien stated that the interference of both Wizards, both in the East and South, was the reason that Sauron was not at sufficient strength to be able to resist the Númenor invasion:

{{Blockquote|Thus it was that though, as soon as [Sauron's] disguise was pierced and he was recognized as an enemy, he exerted all his time and strength to gathering and training armies, it took some ninety years before he felt ready to open war. And he misjudged this, as we see in his final defeat, when the great host of Minastir from Númenor landed in Middle-earth. His gathering of armies had not been unopposed, and his success had been much less than his hope. But this is a matter spoken of in notes on “The Five Wizards”. He had powerful enemies behind his back, the East, and in the Southern lands to which he had not yet given sufficient thought.|""Note on the Delay of Gil-galad and the Númenóreans"", ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''}}

Based on these later writings, a history of the two Wizards can be summarised as the following:<ref name=""PMLast"" />

*The two Wizards were known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, ""Darkness-slayer"" and ""East-helper"".
*The two Wizards were sent to Middle-earth at roughly the same time as Glorfindel in c. {{SA|1600}} (and similarly at the behest of the Valar), the Year of Dread, when Sauron forged [[The One Ring]] and completed the building of [[Barad-dûr]].
*The two Wizards journeyed into the East and South of Middle-earth, though it's uncertain whether they separated.
*They were tasked with finding Sauron's hiding place in the East. They failed.
*They brought ""help to the few tribes of Men [in the East] that had rebelled from Melkor-worship,"" and they encouraged rebellion against Sauron.<ref name=""PMLast"" /> They were able to hinder Sauron's gathering and training of armies in the East and South during the Second Age, aiding the defeat of Sauron in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] and beyond.<ref>{{NM|P3xviii}}</ref>
*They ensured that Sauron's forces in the East did not outnumber the West, thus ultimately helping secure victory for the Free peoples against Sauron in the [[War of the Ring]].

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Ithryn Luin'' consists of ''[[ithron|ithryn]]'' (""wizards""; plural of ''ithron'') and ''[[luin]]'' (""blue"").<ref name=""UTIndex"">{{UT|Index}}</ref>

==Νames and etymologies==
''Alatar'' and ''Pallando'' are [[Quenya]] names. The first is not clear, and possibly contains the Quenya elements for ""radiance"" (cf. [[Alatariel]]) and/or the ending ''-[[tar]]'' ""lord"" (cf.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
The Blue Wizards have not appeared physically in any adaptation of [[Middle-earth]] works so far, and they are mentioned and implied only in the following adaptations:

'''1993: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]: [[Valar and Maiar]]'':'''
:Alatar is the senior of the Blue Wizards. As the most physically skilled of the order, he favours the Elven long bow and is thus also known as the Old Hunter. He has become enamoured of power and has his own kingdom in the East. It is strongly implied that he may become a new threat after Sauron's fall.<ref>{{ICE|2006}}, p. 78</ref>

:Pallando has split from Alatar and now lives among those who follow his words. He is known as the Soul-keeper, which can be taken quite literally given that he is described as [[Valar_and_Maiar#Notable_artefacts|possessing artefacts that let him store souls]].<ref>{{ICE|2006}}, pp. 84-85</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Khundolar tribe of the [[Easterlings]] had among them the ""Blue Caste"" of sorcerers. Their Master, ""Yirokhsar the Blue"", forbade his followers to march with the Dark Lord's forces, but many still joined their kings who had fallen under the sway of [[Sauron]]. Also, the Jangovar Easterlings viewed Sauron as a god, but were confused why their master, ""Yetkeyin the Violet"", refused to obey Sauron.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:[[Gandalf]] mentions the Blue Wizards when he explains the number of Wizards, and says that he has forgotten their names.
:
:
:Since the film production team did not have the rights to include material from sources other than ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the decision to include the line ""Blue Wizards"" (only appearing in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 244</ref>) has been regarded as legally controversial.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Janet Brennan Croft]]|articleurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731034017/http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythsoc/message/23828|articlename=Source Material (message #23828)|dated=17 December 2012|website=[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythsoc/ MythSoc mailing list]|accessed=27 February 2023}}</ref>

'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''
:[[File:Middle-earth- Shadow of War .png|thumb|312x312px|An azurite figurine of the Blue Wizards in ''Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor'']]In the game, three artefacts describe the encounter of two Wizards whose names could not be remembered travelling side by side into [[Mordor]]. It is implied to be the Blue Wizards from the description of the artefact. Furthermore, a figurine depicting them has been carved out of azurite, a blue stone. More lore tells the player that the [[Black Hand]] could have been a king that brought Sauron the heads of two Istari. Whether or not this is true is unknown.

'''Gimli''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of the [[House of Durin]] who became famous as the only Dwarven member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].

==History==
Gimli was born in the [[Blue Mountains]] during a time of exile for the [[Durin's Folk]], about [[Third Age 2770|a century]] after the tragic destruction of [[Dale]] and the [[Sack of Erebor|Sacking]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Smaug]] the Golden. His father was [[Glóin]], a direct descendant of [[King of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Náin II]] and, through him, of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name=appdurin>{{App|Durin}}</ref> His father joined [[Thorin and Company]] in their [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] to reclaim the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]], but Gimli was forbidden because he was too young: only 62 at the time.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

The Dwarves were successful in their Quest and Gimli and his father were among the Dwarves who returned to Erebor. Years later, in {{TA|3017}}, Gimli witnessed the arrival of a messenger of [[Sauron]] (possibly a [[Nazgûl]]) inquiring about [[Bilbo Baggins]], old acquaintance of his father, and the [[One Ring|Ring of Power]], promising tempting offers. Gimli accompanied his troubled father to [[Rivendell]] for the dual purpose of warning Bilbo and seeking the counsel of [[Elrond]] on such weighty matters. He attended the [[Council of Elrond]] as a representative of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

===The Fellowship of the Ring===
Gimli, as the only young dwarf seen at the council of Elrond, was appointed as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He alone of the company wore a mail-shirt, and carried a broad-bladed axe. He quickly distinguished himself in the company by declaring that he ""[needed] no map"" and naming the [[Misty Mountains]] individually by their [[Khuzdul]] names, inspiring the comment from [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]: ""A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!""<ref name=""South"">{{FR|South}}</ref>
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Balin's Tomb.jpg|left|thumb|''Balin's Tomb'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Gimli stood more than all the others with [[Gandalf]] on the matter of passing through [[Moria]]. This may be influenced by his curiosity about the fate of his cousin [[Balin]], who went thither to [[Balin's folk|refound]] the ancient kingdom of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]], and also his vengeful nature. His first clash with [[Legolas]] occurred before the [[Doors of Durin]], in a brief dispute over whose fault it was (the Elves’ or the Dwarves’) that the friendship between the two races waned.<ref name=""Journey"">{{FR|Journey}}</ref> Gandalf quickly intervened, though it was not until [[Lothlórien]] that they would truly become friends.

He was quite helpful to Gandalf in explaining the Doors to the other curious members of the fellowship. Gandalf showed his appreciation of Gimli’s skills by letting him walk up front through the dark tunnels beside himself, and taking brief counsels with him when the way was unsure. It is probable that here Gandalf was tapping into Dwarven inborn or developed skills rather than actual knowledge of Moria itself, as Gimli had never personally been there.

Gimli reacted most indignantly to Sam’s suggestion that Moria was but ""holes"", going so far as to chant for him an ancient [[The world was young, the mountains green,|song]]. Gimli continued to be helpful to Gandalf on the rest of the dark passage, and boldly aided in the [[Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul]], protecting Balin’s tomb. After Gandalf remained behind to halt the Balrog, Gimli led the others across the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]].

He again showed great emotion when they neared [[Kheled-zâram]], taking [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] alone out of all the company with him to see it (though Sam followed as well).<ref name=""Lorien"">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> This hinted at a degree of affection for Frodo, though it may merely have been because he was the most important of the company. Despite his helpfulness, at [[Lothlórien]] he became the greatest hindrance to the Company, when he alone was required to be blindfolded and of all of them liked the idea the least (save for perhaps Legolas). The compromise was made that the entire company would go through the Golden Wood in this manner, that Gimli would not suffer alone.<ref name=""Lorien"" />

Despite this early struggle, it was Gimli of all the company that was most remembered for his deeds in Lothlórien. For his heart softened towards [[Galadriel]] and as a result toward Elves in general when that great lady sympathised with his sorrows, using the traditional Khuzdul names.<ref name=""Mirror"">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> In return he attempted to compliment her, as he saw her love and understanding. Though slightly clumsy in his first attempt, he distinguished himself when, as Galadriel gave the Company [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]], he asked only for a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three hairs with a blessing, probably remembering when [[Fëanor]] had requested a similar gift several millennia ago. She later referred to him as ""[[Lockbearer]]"". Gimli wept openly at the departure from Lothlórien, calling the light more dangerous than the darkness he had feared.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

By the time the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Gimli had become fast friends with Legolas the Elf, a result of Galadriel’s kindness. This, too, made him famous among all the Dwarves of the [[Third Age]].

===The Three Hunters===
{{Main|Three Hunters}}
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Pursuit in Rohan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Pursuit in Rohan'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], during which he and Legolas slew many [[orcs]], Gimli listened in silence as his only remaining comrades, [[Aragorn]] and Legolas, sang a [[Song of Boromir|lament]] for Boromir in the character of three of the Winds. Only the East Wind was left, and Gimli would not sing it, which Aragorn declared to be appropriate.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref>

For most of the chase he served as a commentator, usually leaving the decisions to Aragorn. His reaction was quite hostile to the suspicious [[Rohirrim]], especially after [[Éomer]]'s rash comments about Galadriel. Little did either know that they would become close friends in the times to come as fiery words passed between them. After the [[Three Hunters]] were lent horses, Gimli and Éomer parted in peace, with promises to one another of reconciliation.

Of the Three Hunters, Gimli seemed the most shaken by [[Fangorn Forest]] while they searched for traces of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Gimli felt no reluctance to shoot the “unarmed” old man whom they thought was [[Saruman]], unlike Aragorn and Legolas. After Gandalf was revealed to them, Gimli fell to his knees. Gandalf put his hand on Gimli’s head, and the dwarf laughed for the first time recorded during the [[Quest of the Ring]].

Gimli was delighted by the [[White Mountains]] and [[Helm's Deep]], declaring ""This country has tough bones"". He declared that if he had a hundred of his kin he could make the fortress invincible.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 532</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The Glittering Caves of Aglarond.jpg|thumb|left|''The Glittering Caves of Aglarond'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
During the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Gimli saved Éomer’s life outside the gates. He came in, boasting of his first two orc-kills to his friend Legolas. Legolas estimated his slaughter to amount to twenty, starting the good-hearted orc-killing game that continued through the rest of the battle. Gimli was among the first to the culvert when the orcs crept through, leaping heroically into their midst from the walls. He then proceeded to lead the blocking up of the culvert.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref> During the course of the battle, Gimli was one of those forced into the [[Glittering Caves]]. He was astonished to see the magnificence of these caverns, moving even Legolas with his glowing description of them.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, pp. 547-8</ref> This one sight would change his life.

His final kill score number was forty-two in that battle, surpassing his friend the elf by one.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 543</ref> Gimli shows a hint of humour and affection when he greets the two [[Hobbits]] Merry and Pippin comfortably situated among [[wikipedia:flotsam|flotsam]] and [[wikipedia:jetsam|jetsam]] in the ruin of [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 557</ref> He declared himself deep in Pippin’s debt when the hobbit lent him his spare pipe.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 563</ref>

Gimli shows some of the stone hardness of Dwarves when they meet [[Saruman]] at [[Orthanc]]. Saruman uses the power in his voice to sway [[Théoden]] to forgive him and make peace, and many of the [[Rohirrim]] are moved by his magic and are spell-bound. Unmoved, Gimli comments that Saruman's words cannot be trusted and that from Orthanc, help would mean ruin.  Saruman is angered enough by Gimli that for a moment he loses his charm.

As the fellowship of friends again began to break up – Gandalf and Pippin heading for [[Minas Tirith]], [[Théoden]] and his riders for [[Dunharrow]] – Gimli out of love and respect for Aragorn went with him, Legolas, the sons of Elrond, and the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] on the [[Paths of the Dead]].  He showed great reluctance before the [[Dark Door]], the final thought that drove him downward was the thought of being bested by an Elf underground.

He participated in the epic [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], returning with Aragorn and his other companions on the ships of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], and later recounted their journey to the fascinated Hobbits. He began to fear for Legolas, who seemed entranced by the Sea. His position on Elves completely changed, he remarked ""If all the fair folk take to the Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay"".<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref> He was much more sceptical as to the overall end of [[Men]] than his comrade.{{fact}}

Gimli fought in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], passing through unscathed, and finding the alive but bruised Pippin among the dead lying on the hill. He returned to the [[Field of Cormallen]] to be reunited with his friends, and there displayed open affection for all of them, even Pippin (""If only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never forget"").<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>

===After the War of the Ring===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Legolas and Gimli Reach the Shores of Valinor.jpg|thumb|right|''Gimli and Legolas reach the shores of Valinor'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]  
After the coronation of Aragorn, Gimli said farewell to his old friend Éomer, who begged for pardon as to his words on Galadriel, though he added that he still didn’t think she was the fairest in the world. When he added that he considered [[Arwen]] the fairest instead, Gimli was content with this.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 975</ref>

During the return journey he visited many places with Legolas, including Fangorn Forest and [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]]. Eventually he returned to Erebor, to find it nearly devastated by war. [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] had died, and [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]] was now King. Eventually, though, he returned to the Glittering Caves with a contingent of dwarves, becoming the ""[[Lord of the Glittering Caves]]"". He rebuilt the gates of Minas Tirith with ''[[mithril]]'' and steel, and in both [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]] accomplished great works. There he met his friends Merry and Pippin and the [[Appendix A|history of his people]] made its way to the [[Red Book]];<ref>{{App|A}}</ref> he also set out the genealogical tree of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] for King Elessar.<ref name=appdurin/>

In Aglarond, it is assumed, he lived on until he was old, and in {{FoA|120}} he sailed with his friend Legolas across [[Belegaer]] to [[Valinor]], becoming the first and only Dwarf to do so.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gimli.mp3|Ardamir}}
In [[1978]], [[Jim Allan]] noted that the name ''Gimli'' appears once in the ''[[Völuspá]]'' and three times in the ''Prose Edda''. Allan suggested that ''Gimli'' means ""One-of-Gimlé"" or ""One-of-Gimill"", where [[Wikipedia:Gimlé|''Gimlé''/''Gimill'']] in the ''Eddas'' is a hall of the after-life ""''inhabited solely by [[Calaquendi#Inspiration|Light-elves]]''"" (evoking Gimli's leaving for [[Aman]]). He also noted that the nominative form ''Gimlé'' of the dative form ''Gimli'' consists of the elements ''gim'' (""fire"") and ''hlé'' (""shelter"", ""lee"").<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in a draft letter after he had been questioned about the name ''Gimli'' that the  poetic archaic [[Old Norse]] word ''gim'' seems to have meant ""fire"".<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 382</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name ""[[Gimli (elf)|Gimli]]"" was first used by Tolkien for the name of a [[Gnome]] in the ''[[Tale of Tinúviel]]'', written in mid-1910s.<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>

In the [[Adûnaic]] language described in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ([[1945]]), ''gimli'' (pl. ''gimil'') is the word for ""[[stars|star]]"", derived from a [[root]] G-M-L and having the Characteristic Vowel I. From these derive others words such as ''igmil'' ""a star-shaped formation""; and ''Gimilnitîr'' ""Star-kindler"" ([[Gilthoniel]]), a name for [[Varda]].<ref>{{SD|3vi5}}, p. 427-428</ref>

'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:Gimli is chosen as the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] representative of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He departs second-last, in front of [[Legolas]].

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Gimli is portrayed as almost as tall as [[Aragorn]] and [[Legolas]]. He has a brown beard and wears a hood. [[David Buck]] provided Gimli's voice.

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Gimli is provided by [[Gail Chugg]].

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Both Gimli and Legolas are omitted from this adaptation, as it centres on Aragorn.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Gimli is provided by Vladimír ""Ady"" Hajdu. Hajdu portrays Gimli's voice as less gruff than most other adaptations, and though he is a fierce warrior, he is sensitive and insightful and often fairly cheerful. At one point in the series, when his companions in the Fellowship ask him if he heard a suspicious noise, he exclaims ""I only hear the whisper of stones and mosses"" (a possible reference to Tolkien's Dwarves being attuned to stone and the mountains as much as Elves are to the woods and sea).

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:[[John Rhys-Davies]] portrayed Gimli in voice and close-ups; Brett Beattie was his size-double. Jackson used the antagonism between Legolas and Gimli, although he placed most of it on Gimli's plate.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gimli is portrayed as a burly lumberjack, slightly smaller than Legolas, but the same size as Boromir. His moment of glory is in [[Moria]], where he aids the player (at this point, Frodo) in trying to find the Bridge. He is voiced by [[James Horan]].

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Now that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were no longer around to provide comic relief, Gimli was chosen to fill the spot. This has led to much criticism.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gimli is one of the three playable characters.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:As in the second film Gimli's character was somewhat controversially used to insert comic relief into the scenes he appeared in.

'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gimli is a playable character, with an aggressive fighting style. He and Legolas accompany Aragorn through Paths of the Dead, later he fights on Pelennor fields and at the Black Gate.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|Sierra's War of the Ring]]'':'''
:[[Bob Papenbrook]] provided the voice of Gimli, who is a Hero Unit for the Free People side. His first appearance is near the Lonely Mountain, where he and other dwarves fight orcs and later activate a giant catapult.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Gimil is a Hero Unit for the Rohan faction in skirmishes, though he accompanies the Fellowship in the storyline mode.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Gimli is now the Hero for the Dwarven faction.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gimli is first met by Dwarven characters in the intro taking place in {{TA|2941}}, shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, all characters meet him in Rivendell where Gimli accompanies them on a mission to the [[Misty Mountains]]. The player catches up with Gimli at several points during the Fellowship's journey and also fights alongside Gimli in the [[Glittering Caves]] during the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and in Northern [[Ithilien]] during the [[Army of the West]]'s march towards the [[Black Gate]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], Gimli and Legolas join the [[Gondor]]ian army in exploring and securing the Land of Shadow. There, Gimli finds a dwarven clan from the East who have been used as skilled slaves by the Dark Lord for centuries. He leads the survivors to [[Erebor]] and secures King [[Thorin Stonehelm]]'s permission for them to reside in his halls, before returning south to [[Minas Tirith]] for the wedding of Aragorn and [[Arwen]].

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:Gimli is a playable hero available in several missions.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Gimli can be found and talked to in Rivendell, he retains the appearance from the movies. While he provides insight into many events, interactions with him do not affect the main plot.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:When Thorin's Company are arrested in [[Mirkwood]], Legolas searches Glóin's possessions and finds a picture wallet. Legolas comments how ugly the portraits are and Glóin points out that it's his son's portrait, parodying the future friendship of the two.

'''2023: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria]]'':'''
:During the [[Fourth Age]], Gimli summons a company of Dwarves and tasks them with reclaiming the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of [[Moria]].

'''Figwit''', also known as '''Aegnor''' and the '''Elf Escort''', is an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Rivendell]] who appears very briefly in the films. Figwit was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]].

==History==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Figwit.jpg|left|thumb|Figwit's appearance at the Council of Elrond in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]
Figwit is first seen during the [[Council of Elrond]] where he is sitting next to [[Aragorn]] before the Council begins to argue. After Frodo shouts ""I will take it"" and everyone turns to look at him, Figwit appears in the background to the far right for only just a fraction of a second.

Figwit appears again when [[Arwen]] is leaving with a [[Wandering Companies|wandering company]] of [[Elves]] for the [[Grey Havens]] and has a [[Arwen's Vision|vision]] about her future son [[Eldarion]]. Figwit beckons Arwen to return to the other Elves. His exact words are ""Lady Arwen, we cannot delay"" and ""My lady"".

==Fandom==
Figwit's rise to fame began shortly after the first movie, and some fans believe that he was given dialog in the third movie because [[Peter Jackson]] was aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of the ''Return of the King'']]: <blockquote>''The decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them.''</blockquote>

===Figwit's ""brother""===
Figwit has a lesser known ""brother"", played by extra Blair Morton. '''Meorof''', also known as the ""Mystery Elf On (The) Right Of Figwit"", appears at the [[Council of Elrond]] sitting in the seat on Figwit's right<ref> {{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.theargonath.cc/characters/meorof/meorof.html|articlename=Meorof|dated=|website=[https://www.theargonath.cc/ www.argonath.cc]|accessed=28 August 2008}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name '''Figwit''' is a humorous acronym created by fans which stands for ""[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] is grea...who is THAT?!?""<ref name=""website"">{{webcite|author=inDUHvidual and Arwenelf|articleurl=http://www.figwitlives.net/faq.htm#|articlename=FigwitLives' FAQ|dated=|website=[http://www.figwitlives.net/ www.figwitlives.net]|accessed=23 August 2005}}</ref>

==Other names==
Figwit is credited in the credits of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' under the name '''Elf Escort''', and his [[Decipher Card]] gives the name '''[[Aegnor]]''', a name derived from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=""website"" />

In [[Fanfiction|fan fiction]], Figwit is sometimes called '''Melpomaen''', a shoddy translation of the elements ""fig"" (''melpo'' in [[Qenya]]) and ""wit"" (''maen'' in [[Noldorin]]).<ref name=""website"" />

Bret McKenzie's character in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' is '''[[Lindir]]''', who shares similarities with Figwit. Both are dark-haired Elves of [[Rivendell]] and courtiers of [[Elrond]]. It is unclear if the two characters are intended to be the same, which would establish a film ""canon"" name for Figwit.

==Other media==
In 2004, a 50-minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon, [http://www.enzedff.co.nz/filmsynopsis.asp?FilmID=1802&Archive=0&RegionID=1&EventID=8 ''""Frodo is great... Who is that?!!""''], was made by three [[Wellington]] filmmakers - Stan Alley, Nick Booth, and Hannah Clarke - all of whom worked on Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' adaptation. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to Edinburgh where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and ""elvish good looks"" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as [[Peter Jackson]], [[Barry Osbourne]], [[Mark Ordesky]], [[Ian McKellen]], and a pre-fame [[Taika Waititi]].

Figwit has also appeared in official merchandise of the movie franchise: once on an autograph card, and once on a card for [[Arwen]]. Both of these cards are made by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps Topps].<ref name=""website"" />

The '''yellow-fanged guard'''<ref name="":0"">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.029}}</ref> was an [[Orcs|orc]] in the company of orcs that kidnapped [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]].

==History==
Two or more orc were guarding the captured [[hobbits]]. These orcs spoke with each other in [[Orkish|their own tongue,]] but used [[Westron|Common Speech]] when talking to Pippin. The yellow-fanged guard threatened Pippin with this knife.<ref name="":1"" /> He also cursed the [[Orcs of Isengard|Isengarders]] and their leader [[Uglúk]] both in [[Westron|Common Speech]] and in a debased form of [[Black Speech]].<ref name="":1"" /><sup>,</sup><ref name="":3"">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix F]], ""The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age"", ""Of Other Races""</ref> [[Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búbhosh skai|His curse]] is one  of the two known phrases in Black Speech.

Soon a quarrel arose among the orcs about their future route and the fate of the prisoners.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.010}}</ref> The yellow-fanged guard joined the fray<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.028}}</ref> and was cut down by broad-bladed swords of the followers of Uglúk.<ref name="":0"" /> His body fell on top of Pippin,<ref name="":0"" /> who managed to cut the ropes tying his arms using the knife that the orc still held in his dead hand.<ref name="":2"" /> Four more orcs were slain by Uglúk<ref name="":0"" /> and other Isengarders<ref name="":2"" /> during that quarrel.

==Origin==
It is unclear whether the yellow-fanged guard was a [[Orcs of Mordor|Mordor Orc]] or an [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orc of the Misty Mountains]]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] himself in the [[Appendix F]] identified him as ""the Mordor-orc"" and as a soldier of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] whose captain was [[Grishnákh]].<ref name="":3"" /> On the other hand, [[Aragorn]] called some or all of the five orcs slain in that quarrel ""Northern Orcs from far away"".<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.02.011}}</ref> However, considering that the Fellowship previously encountered black [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] of [[Mordor]] in [[Moria]],<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 2.05.028}}</ref> both of these statements may be true in the same time.

{{quote|He looks more than half like a goblin.|[[Frodo Baggins]]<ref name=""FRI11""/>}}

The '''squint-eyed southerner''' was a brigand driven from [[Dunland]], rumored to have a strain of [[Orcs|Orc]]-blood in him. He initially acted as one of the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]'s most trusted agents, before being compelled into the service of the [[Nazgûl]] as an informant.

== History ==
Hailing from Dunland, the squint-eyed southerner was banished by his fellow [[Dunlendings|hillmen]] due to a rumor that he had Orc-blood coursing through his veins (implying he may have been one of the [[Half-orcs]] or [[Goblin-men]]).<ref name=""UT10"">{{UT|10}}, ""Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire""</ref>

Having entered the employ of the Wizard Saruman, the southerner was at one point stationed on the borders of [[the Shire]] to negotiate the purchase of ""[[pipe-weed|leaf]]"" and other supplies which were stored in [[Isengard]] in preparation for the [[War of the Ring|war]]. The squint-eyed southerner had been instructed by his master to infiltrate the Shire and learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding the [[Ring-bearer]]. The southerner was well supplied with maps, lists of names, and notes concerning the Shire.

In September of {{TA|3018}}, the Dunlending was traveling back to the Shire when the black-robed [[Nazgûl]] came upon him at the [[Tharbad]] crossing. When questioned, the southerner told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying the White Wizard; this proved Saruman was withholding information from his own master, [[Sauron]]. The Lord of [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]] was made aware of the name [[Baggins Family|Baggins]] and [[Hobbiton]] was singled out for immediate visit and inquiry.

The Witch-king put the [[Shadow]] of Fear on the southerner and sent him to [[Bree]] as a spy, warning him he now answered to the [[Eye of Sauron|Red Eye]] and not the [[White Hand]]. The Dunlending met up with [[Bill Ferny]] and at the [[Prancing Pony]] on [[September 29]]th, the two of them saw [[Frodo Baggins]] vanish into thin air. After reporting the information to the Nazgûl, the Nine Black Riders came to attack that night.<ref name=""UT10""/>

Aragorn kept the Hobbits safe through the night. The next morning, the squint-eyed southerner was spotted inside Bill Ferny's house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name=""FRI11"">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

Nothing else is recorded of the squint-eyed southerner. However in {{TA|3019|n}}, a large number of [[Ruffians]] occupied the Shire and oppressed the Hobbits.<ref>{{HM|RK}}, ""[[The Scouring of the Shire]]""</ref> It is possible the southerner was among them as many of Saruman's agents there resembled him. The Men were driven out of the Shire in the [[Battle of Bywater]] on November 3.

== Description ==
{{quote|Just what my father meant to convey by the 'squint-eyed Southerner' at Bree I'm not sure. I don't think that he can possibly have meant that the man had 'slit-eyes' (goblin-like). He may have meant that he actually had a squint (optical disorder), but that seems unnecessarily particular. So the likeliest meaning, I think, is that the man didn't look straight, but obliquely, watchfully, sideways, suggesting craftiness and crookedness.|[[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>""The Squint-eyed Southerner"", ''[[Beyond Bree]]'', May [[1990]], p. 9</ref>}}

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
: A character called '''The Southerner''' (loosely based on the novel character) attempts to talk Harley Bramble into joining with a gang of outlaws. After Bramble is convinced not to by [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], the Southerner threatens that his ""[[Mordor|powerful]] [[Isengard|friends]]"" will trouble the trio. If the player returns to Bree after the mission to [[Mount Gundabad]], it will be revealed that Ruffians have attacked the town but have been defeated, with Bramble claiming he himself made sure the Southerner will trouble Bree-folk no more.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''
:A character credited as '''Squint''' appears in the prologue in Bree. Along with another character credited as ""Bill Ferny Sr."" (loosely based on Bill Ferny), Squint has seemingly tracked [[Thorin]] to the Prancing Pony (presumably to collect on the bounty put out on Thorin's head). The two Men are preparing to confront Thorin when [[Gandalf]] goes over and sits and starts talking with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]. When it becomes apparent the [[Wizards|Wizard]] is not going anywhere, Bill and Squint get up and leave the inn.

'''Mundo Sackville-Baggins''' is a character created specifically for [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]. 

He was mistakenly identified by the [[Blackwolds]] to be the Hobbit carrying the Ring<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref> that they were looking for and taken to [[Bree-land]] in hopes of selling him to the [[Nazgûl]]. He was rescued by [[Strider]] and [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]], in which Amdir was stabbed by a Nazgûl. After the Nazgûl was driven off, they fled to [[Archet]] to recover. Shortly after, Archet was attacked by the Blackwolds and burned down. In the wake, Amdir was taken by the Nazgûl to become a [[Cargul]].

When he returned to [[the Shire]] he requested compensation for his treatment at Archet from the Mayor of [[Michel Delving]], [[Will Whitfoot]].<ref>{{VGC|SAP}}</ref>

He is the nephew of [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]].

'''Lurtz''' was the first of the [[Uruk-hai]] bred by [[Saruman]]. Lurtz was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Lawrence Makoare]]. Though an original character, Lurtz inherits traits from [[Uglúk]], the leader of Isengard Uruk-hai in the book.

==History==
Lurtz was the first of [[Saruman|Saruman's]] [[Uruk-hai]] to be bred, and led them into battle against the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] at [[Amon Hen]]. Lurtz also appeared to be the largest Uruk-hai, and his strength is highlighted when he strangles an Orc immediately after being spawned. In the book, [[Boromir]] is slain by an unnamed orc or orcs; he is described as having been ""pierced by many arrows"". In the film he is killed by Lurtz, who shot him three times. Before he could shoot a fourth arrow into Boromir, [[Aragorn]] intervened and a duel ensued. While Lurtz seemed to have the upper hand in the beginning due to his brute strength, he fell utterly short when it came to swordfighting; Aragorn quickly severed his opponent's sword arm and delivered a fatal thrust to the stomach. Lurtz tried to taunt Aragorn one last time, but was shortly after decapitated.

After his death, leadership of the troop of Uruk-hai passed to [[Uglúk]], as was always the case in the books.

==Etymology==
The name ""Lurtz"" may have been derived by [[Peter Jackson]] and his co-writers from the style of Tolkien's [[Orkish]] language, specifically the name [[Barad-dûr#Etymology|Lugbúrz]].

Lurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the film, and is only known from the franchise and credits.

==Other versions==
In video games, Lurtz has been voiced by [[Isaac C. Singleton Jr.]].

Lurtz is one of the playable heroes of the Isengard Faction in ''[[EA's The Battle for Middle-earth Anthology]]''.

'''Farin''' is one of the three main characters of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. Farin is a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] champion of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name=""Backstory Farin""/>

==History==
===Youth===
Farin's family originally lived in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. But after the attack of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] they went in exile to the [[Iron Hills]], where Farin was born. 

News of the return of [[Thorin]] to Erebor reached the Iron Hills when Farin was still very young. Because there was a great need for soldiers, Farin marched in the army of [[Dáin Ironfoot]] to Erebor. There he fought in the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], where he proved to be a very strong warrior. For this reason, Dáin made him a member of his personal guard.<ref name=""Backstory Farin""/>

[[File:The Lord of the Rings- War in the Nortgh - Farin (video game character).png|250px|thumb|Concept Art of '''Farin'''.]]

===Life as Dáin's personal guard===
After the battle Erebor was reclaimed by the Dwarves, and Dáin was crowned as [[King under the Mountain]]. Farin served him in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and fought together with the [[Bardings|men of Dale]] against the [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]]. Somewhere after {{TA|3001}} [[Bilbo Baggins]] visited Erebor to meet with his old friends. During this time Farin met Bilbo, and he was very impressed with him.

When a messenger of [[Sauron]] came to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in {{TA|3018}} and asked information about ""[[Baggins family|Baggins]]"" and  ""[[the Shire]]"", Farin was very worried. He thought that it was the task of his people to protect Bilbo Baggins and the Shire,  and therefore he did swore an oath that he would travel to that country and protect it. He searched for other companions, but none wanted to travel with him as Erebor was threatened by enemies. Therefore, he went alone after Dáin granted him permission to go.<ref name=""Backstory Farin""/>

===War of the Ring===
Farin arrived at the borders of the Shire and protected one of its access roads. He questioned travellers, and sent those who he didn't trust away. The [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] heard of Farin, and [[Halbarad]] tried to resolve this mystery. Halbarad disguised himself as a traveller and gained Farin's confidence, who told him about his mission. As Halbarad was convinced that Farin's intentions were good, he asked him to join the Rangers in their guard.<ref name=""Backstory Farin""/>

[[File:2011-12-23 00011.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and '''Farin''' in [[Bree]].]]Farin joined the Rangers at [[Sarn Ford]], and became a friend of [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Kilaran]] and [[Luin (video game character)|Luin]]. Just shortly before the [[Nazgûl]] attacked Sarn's Ford, he met [[Andriel]], who was surprised to see a Dwarf among the Rangers.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=3 January 2012}}</ref>

The next morning he assisted, together with Eradan and Andriel, the Rangers while they were attacked by the Nazgûl. They were defeated, and many of the Rangers were slain. However, shortly after the attack the [[Witch-king]] met with [[Agandaûr]]. Agandaûr tells the Witch-king that he had summoned the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and assembled an army in [[Fornost]]. The Witch-king send him back to Fornost, to attack immediately.<ref name=""Prologue"">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

Halbarad sent Eradan, Andriel and Farin to [[Bree]], to warn [[Aragorn]] about this news. The three companions meet him in [[Prancing Pony]], and tell him what happened at Sarn's Ford. Aragorn immediately sends them Fornost, to stop Agandaûr before he attacks.<ref name=""Prologue""/>

In [[Fornost]] Farin and his companions, Eradan and Andriel, find a chained [[Eagle]], captured by [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]]. After killing his jailers, he introduces himself as [[Beleram]], one of the Eagles of the [[Misty Mountains]]. While gathering news for his lord - [[Gwaihir]] - he was taken out of the air by siege engines and sorcerers. Farin and his companions make a plan with Beleram to destroy the siege weapons, so Beleram can safely fly over Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> 
On the top of Fornost's battlements, Farin pushes two siege weapons from the battlements while [[Beleram]] attracts the attention of the [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]]. The plan succeeds. Furthermore, they kill an Orc sorcerer and retrieve an unreadable scroll.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Battlements''</ref> 

[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Eradan, Andriel, Farin, Elladan and Elrohir.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Andriel]], [[Elladan]], [[Elrohir]], [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]] and '''Farin''' at the gate of the Citadel.]] Further on, in the inner wards, Farin, Eradan and Andriel meet the sons of [[Elrond]], who were sent by their father to scout Fornost. Andriel, who was trained by them, introduces her companions to them and explains their mission. They team up to kill [[Agandaûr]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer Wards''</ref> Although separating, both groups (with the help of Beleram) eventually reach the citadel of Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> The citadel gate, however, is protected by [[Magic]], and [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] need all their power and concentration to undo the magical protection. At the same time, a band of [[Orcs]] arrives which is successfully stopped by Farin and his companions.<ref name=""tower""/>

Inside the Citadel tower, the group overhears a conversation between Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], the leader of the [[Orcs]] of [[Mount Gram]]. The latter informs Agandaûr that intruders have been spotted. Agandaûr commands the Orc to find and kill the intruders immediately, after which Agandaûr leaves. The group attempts to follow him, but is separated again when Tharzog notices them and closes the gates. Farin, Eradan and Andriel kill Tharzog and his guard.<ref name=""tower"">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>

On the top of the Citadel tower they find Agandaûr fighting Elladan and Elrohir. Although he has the upper hand, he is not strong enough to fight Farin, Andriel, Eradan and the twins at the same time. He flees on the back of a [[Fell Beast]]. Although Beleram chases Agandaûr, the sorcerer summons a thunderstorm. After being hit by lightning, Beleram returns to the tower. They discuss the events concerning Agandaûr and Fornost, and decide to part: Beleram returns to [[Gwaihir]], the sons of Elrond return to their father in [[Rivendell]] and Farin and his companions travel to [[Sarn Ford]] to inform Halbarad.<ref name=""tower""/>

{{quote|Denethor looked indeed much more like a great [[Wizards|Wizard]] than [[Gandalf]] did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[Minas Tirith (chapter)|Minas Tirith]]""}}

'''Denethor II''' was the twenty-sixth and last [[Steward of Gondor|Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]]. He succeeded his father [[Ecthelion II]] at his death in {{TA|2984}}. Denethor was described as appearing noble and powerful, even to rival the lordliness of Gandalf. He was proud, tall, wise, far-sighted, and valiant; ""more kingly"" than any of his predecessors for a long time. He proved a masterful lord and a great ruler, seeing to all things large and small under his command.<ref name=""A"">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> During the [[War of the Ring]],  however, his good judgement became tainted by ""pride and despair,"" resulting from recent military losses at [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|Osgiliath]], the use of a [[palantir]], the death of his son [[Boromir]], and the threat to his Stewardship represented by [[Aragorn]]'s impending arrival in Gondor. <ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 5.07.034}}</ref> During the [[Siege of Gondor|siege of Minas Tirith]], Denethor set himself ablaze after wrongly believing [[Faramir]], his only other living child (whom he also attempted to burn), was killed in the battle. <ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 5.07.030}}</ref> 

==History==
===Early life===
Denethor was born the third child and first son of Ecthelion II, Ruling Steward of Gondor, in {{TA|2930}}.<ref name=""Elendil"" />

A northerner known as [[Thorongil]] came to the service of his father. He was the same age as Denethor and appeared like the [[Kings of Gondor]] of old.  He was a war genius and won Ecthelion's and the people's trust and affections, and many Gondorians saw him and Denethor as rivals. The stranger talked in favour of [[Gandalf]] whom Denethor didn't trust at all; it is possible that Denethor figured out that Thorongil was really [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]. If Denethor knew that the stranger was the Heir of Isildur, he could have thought that he would conspire with Gandalf to supplant him. Thus, Denethor was not sorry when Thorongil vanished to the east.<ref name=""A"" />
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Denethor and Finduilas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Denethor and Finduilas'' by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]
In {{TA|2976|n}} he married [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]], daughter of [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Prince]] [[Adrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]], whom he loved deeply. She gave birth to two sons: [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]]. He doted upon his eldest son, Boromir, while Faramir, his second son, with his actions and friendship with [[Gandalf|Mithrandir]], often displeased his father.<ref name=""A"" /> In the meantime, Faramir studied the lore of Gondor, including the archives that only he and his father could access. Part of his studies were devoted to the lore of the ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name=""pal"">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>

===Early stewardship===
Eight years after Denethor's marriage, Ecthelion died and he became Ruling Steward. Denethor was not viewed very highly in the eyes of his people in comparison to [[Thorongil]], but Denethor proved a masterful ruler. He listened to counsel, said little, and followed his mind, holding everything in his own hand.

Only four years after the death of Ecthelion, Finduilas died as well. Denethor was grief-stricken, and became more grim and silent. Moreover he anticipated [[Sauron]]'s assault during his time and desperately needed knowledge. Being proud and overconfident in his willpower, Denethor looked into the long-forbidden [[Anor-stone]] to seek knowledge.<ref name=""A"" />

The ''palantír'' showed him much of what he wanted to see, and his knowledge grew exceedingly, so that he was wondered at by the people. But eventually Sauron, looking into the captured [[Ithil-stone]], discovered that Denethor was using the ''palantír''.<ref name=""pal"" /> Sauron attempted to wrench the Anor stone to his will, but failed due to Denethor's strength of will, his integrity, and his right to the use of the stone.<ref name=""pal"" /> But this caused even greater stress upon the steward's already weakened body, coupled by the apparent invincibility of Sauron shown him by the stone and the manner of his viewing<ref name=""pal"" /> and aged prematurely.<ref name=""A"" />
[[File:Anna Kulisz - Looking into the Stone.jpg|thumb|''Looking into the Stone'' by [[:Category:Images by Anna Kulisz|Anna Kulisz]]]]
Denethor, meanwhile, looked not only at [[Mordor]], but also probably to [[Saruman]], and extracted information from the wizard to his benefit, which Sauron was helpless to prevent. He also sought to surpass Thorongil and Gandalf in wisdom, and to keep an eye on them.<ref name=""pal"" />

In all debatable matters of importance domestic, or external, however, even Denethor held [[Council of Gondor|Council]], and at least listened to what the Lords of the Fiefs and the Captains of the Forces had to say.<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> But he became blind to all struggles save that of him and Sauron, his people and Sauron's [[Orcs]]. He mistrusted all his allies who were not under his own rule, and though he cared for his nation, his concerns were largely political; he feared and opposed any potential rivals in the nobility, regardless of their intent, and despised lesser men.<ref name=""A"" /><ref>{{L|183}}</ref> He wore mail under his robes, to prevent himself from getting soft in his old age.<ref name=""siege"">{{RK|V4}}</ref>

===Stirring of trouble===
Faramir, his younger son, began to have dreams, speaking of [[Rivendell|Imladris]] and [[The One Ring|Isildur's Bane]]. Boromir convinced his father to send him instead of his brother. Boromir did not return from his quest; he was shot by [[Uruk-hai]] on [[Amon Hen]]. Faramir and Denethor both heard the [[Great Horn|horn of Gondor]]. Several days later his horn was found by watchers below the [[Entwash]], cloven in two. It was then brought to Denethor. Desperate after the death of his heir, he looked into the ''palantír'' more often than usual and so it grew his despair.<ref name=""A"" />

Knowing of the coming strike of Mordor, Denethor called in the [[Captains of the Outlands]] to defend [[Minas Tirith]]. [[Nazgûl]] began to fly over the city, out of view but still casting shadows of fear.<ref name=""MT"">{{RK|V1}}</ref>
[[File:Cor Blok - Pippin between Gandalf and Denethor.jpg|thumb|200px|""[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] between [[Gandalf]] and Denethor"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
Thirteen days after Boromir's death, Mithrandir arrived with the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]]. Denethor openly vented his rage at first, but at the same time was curiously attracted to the hobbit, a witness of his son's death, questioning him closely and suspiciously. When Peregrin offered his service in return for Boromir's sacrifice, Denethor was pleased and amused. After examining Pippin's [[Daggers of Westernesse|barrow-blade]], he accepted the hobbit's service courteously. He then confronted Gandalf. While they supped, Gandalf told of the fall of [[Isengard]]. Denethor hinted at his own abilities to see what happened in the world. He racked the hobbit with questions for an hour, and then gave his guests lodging.<ref name=""MT"" />

===Siege of Gondor===
Soon after, the [[Rammas Echor|Rammas]] was surrounded and Gondor placed under siege. Faramir returned from errands in [[Ithilien]], and told the story of his encounter with [[Frodo Baggins]], two days before, and of his journey to Cirith Ungol. At the name of this place, Gandalf himself seems to be extremely uneasy.

A discussion on the matter followed between Denethor, Gandalf, and Faramir, in which Denethor revealed he had guessed more than was said by his son. He noticed that Faramir had looked at Mithrandir to understand if he was saying too much. Denethor knew about the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and he was aware of Frodo's mission. He accused Faramir of condemning his people to certain death and told Gandalf that on this matter he would not have destroyed the ring, instead wishing to hide it without using it. Noticing his son's weariness, Denethor allowed Faramir to rest for the night. Denethor never said explicitly that he would have liked for Boromir to live and Faramir to die: when asked by Faramir, he said that he would have liked for their places to be exchanged, as if Boromir was in Ithilien he would have brought him a mighty gift (the Ring).<ref name=""siege"" />

In a council held [[11 March|the next day]], Faramir was sent to strengthen the garrison of [[Osgiliath]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> The decision was not taken by Denethor himself, but by the Council, led by Denethor but to which Faramir took part, agreeing in the end with his father's will.

Faramir recovered the lost ground all the way back to the [[Anduin]], but soon faced fresh troops from [[Minas Morgul]] and [[Harad]], led by the [[Witch-king]], a master strategist and one of terrible presence. Faramir was driven back to the [[Causeway Forts]], but these fell, and Faramir was forced to retreat, having lost a third of his men. The retreat was dogged by the Nazgûl, and Faramir was almost killed by a wound from a southern arrow, thought to be a poisoned dart.<ref name=""siege"" />

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Pyre of Denethor.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|''The Pyre of Denethor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
After [[Imrahil]] had brought him the body of Faramir, nearly dead, Denethor gave in to despair and seemed not to be interested into anything but his son's life. While the outer defences of the [[Pelennor Fields]] collapsed at many points, he looked into the ''palantír''; he found the Enemy stronger than ever on all fronts and feared that the Ring was in his hands; he sees a black sky and Frodo captured in Mordor.

Denethor suddenly seemed to have aged by many years, and his will was snapped. He abandoned leadership of the city to Gandalf and Imrahil, staying by his son's side in the [[Tower of Ecthelion|White Tower]], thinking that everything was lost for his family, his city, and his people. [[Rohan]] had been cut off and could not come to their aid; the first circle was also in flames: the latter piece of information was the final trigger for Denethor's suicide.<ref name=""siege"" />

He prepared a pyre for him and Faramir in [[Rath Dínen]]. He was hampered in his aim by [[Beregond]], one of his own [[Guards of the Citadel]], and Gandalf, who removed Faramir from the pyre. When Faramir called his name, Denethor seemed willing to abandon his suicidal designs, but suddenly he raised up the ''palantír'' and prophesied the doom of Gondor, acknowledging that a new enemy was about to arrive: the pirates from Umbar. In a final speech to Gandalf, he said that he would have liked for things to be as they had always been in his life: to be a ruling Steward of a free city, ruling in peace and with his sons masters of their own will. But if he had to see his city in the hand of an illegitimate [[Kings of Gondor|King]] and his son turned into the pupil of a [[Wizards|wizard]], then he preferred to have nothing and to decide how to end his own life:

{{blockquote|Better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to my pyre. No tomb for Denethor and Faramir! No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like [[Pre-Númenóreans|heathen]] kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the [[Númenor|West]]. The West has failed. Go back and burn!}}

He took the white rod of his office and broke it on his knee, casting it into the flames, symbolising the end of his stewardship and the end of the rule of the Stewards. He then laid himself down on the table with the ''palantír'' on his breast and so perished.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

===Afterwards===
Faramir did survive, and the city did not fall due to the timely appearance of the [[Rohirrim]] and the [[Dúnedain]] with Aragorn II.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> Faramir kept the title of Steward, but not of Ruling Steward, for he recognised Aragorn's right to take the throne. Using [[Athelas]] to save the lives of Faramir, [[Éowyn]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], Aragorn was first acknowledged as King by the people of Minas Tirith before he could actually claim the title. Faramir's reaction to his father's death is not recorded, but it is said that the news of his death wasn't given to him during the first days of his recovery, in order not to grieve him.

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Denethor.mp3|Ardamir}}
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Denethor (king of the Laiquendi)#Etymology|Denethor - Etymology]]. It is possible that Denethor II was named after the [[Nandor|Nando]] chieftain of the [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref>

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Denethor, played by [[John Noble]], appears in a flashback in the film's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]]. He appears at [[Osgiliath]] shortly after [[Boromir]] completes his successful [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|defence]] of the city against [[Sauron]]'s forces and tells Boromir of [[the One Ring]] being found, urging his son to go attend the [[Council of Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]] and try to persuade them to bring it back to [[Gondor]] so as to use it in defence of their homeland against Sauron. Denethor also makes known his preference of Boromir over [[Faramir]], which would further play out in the next film.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Denethor appears almost entirely devoid of hope and highly irrational after learning of Boromir's death. He demands his remaining son go on essentially a suicide mission to reclaim enemy-captured Osgiliath and stubbornly refuses to light the [[warning beacons of Gondor]] to call for the aid of [[Rohan]] (Pippin lights it instead at Gandalf's behest). Denethor then claims [[Théoden]] betrayed him when Sauron's armies begin attacking [[Minas Tirith]]). In the book, the danger of his madness is that it seems to follow a certain logic; Sauron ''does'' have vastly superior forces, all of which he has surely shown to the Steward in the ''palantír''. His actions, however, do not immediately proclaim his insanity; the Osgiliath mission is less obviously suicidal, as the city has not yet been overrun, and the warning beacons have indeed been lit, although Denethor expects little help.

:When Faramir is brought back from Osgiliath on his horse into the throne room, seemingly dead, Pippin attempts to stop Denethor from cremating his son (and himself with him), who he is sure is still alive. After Denethor throws Pippin out, the Hobbit rushes back to the battle to find Gandalf and stop the wanton murder of Faramir. When Gandalf and Pippin return astride [[Shadowfax]], Denethor snatches a torch and (after a cynical monologue about Sauron's power in the extended edition) lights the pyre himself. Gandalf rides in, throwing Denethor off the pyre. Pippin jumps in to pull Faramir off and douses the flames on his body. A maddened Denethor attacks Pippin, but just then, Shadowfax kicks him back onto the pyre. And it's from there that he sees Faramir showing signs of life. Consumed by madness and flames, Denethor screams and flees to the precipice of the citadel, throwing himself off it and plummeting to his death.

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Denethor is provided by Marián Slovák.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Denethor's role in the game is relatively minor, as, by the time the player reaches [[Minas Tirith]], [[Faramir]] already lies wounded and the Steward's will is failing. One notable change is his betrothal of Boromir to [[Lothíriel]] of Dol Amroth.

'''Barahir''' ({{FA|400}} – {{FA|460|n}}) was a [[Men|Man]] of [[Middle-earth]], heir to the [[House of Bëor]] in the [[First Age]] and most famous as the father of [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]].
{{Pronounce|Barahir.mp3|Ardamir}}

==History==
Barahir was the fifth and youngest child of [[Bregor]]. He had three elder sisters: [[Bregil]], [[Hirwen]], and [[Gilwen]], and an elder brother [[Bregolas]]. Barahir married [[Emeldir|Emeldir ''the Man-Hearted'']], who was also of the [[House of Bëor]] through the line of [[Belen]] (youngest son of [[Bëor]]). They had two children, the renowned [[Beren]] the ''One-handed'' and a daughter named [[Hiril (daughter of Barahir)|Hiril]]<ref name=""WJwest"">{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref><ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''The new genealogies of the Edain'', ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 232</ref>

In {{FA|455}}, Barahir fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] at the [[Pass of Sirion]]. Near the [[Fen of Serech]], he hastened to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]'s rescue with a small retinue of his bravest men. They formed a wall of spears around the Elven King, and cut their way out of the battle at great loss. Finrod was saved, and swore an oath in gratitude, promising help to Barahir and his kin should they need it. To reinforce this oath, he gave Barahir [[Ring of Barahir|his ring]], which would become an heirloom in his house.<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

After [[Morgoth]] conquered the lands, Barahir contested his dominion. Gradually all of the people of that region fled until Barahir had but twelve companions left: his son Beren, his nephews [[Baragund]] and [[Belegund]], and nine close and loyal kinsmen, [[Radhruin]], [[Dairuin]], [[Dagnir]], [[Ragnor]], [[Gildor (outlaw)|Gildor]], [[Gorlim]], [[Arthad]], [[Urthel]], and [[Hathaldir]]. As Dorthonion fell under dark enchantment and was called [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] the desperate band retreated to the rocky moors above the forest.<ref name=""Ruin""/>

In {{FA|460}} they were betrayed to [[Sauron]] by [[Gorlim]], who was tricked by Sauron into giving up their location. Barahir and the others were [[Massacre of Tarn Aeluin|slaughtered]] near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. Barahir's son Beren alone escaped, as he was away on an errand when the outlaws' hideout was discovered. Returning to the camp Beren buried his father and pursued the Orcs who slew him. The captain of the Orcs had Barahir's hand with the [[Ring of Barahir|ring of Felagund]] on it when Beren found them; Beren killed the captain and retrieved the hand.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Barahir'' is a [[Sindarin]] word and consists of ''[[bara]]'' (""fiery; eager"") + ''[[hîr]]'' (""master, lord"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 351, 364</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In such early manuscripts as ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' and ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the father of Beren was a [[Gnomes|Gnome]] named '''Egnor bo-Rimion''', who was called [[Rog the Fleet]] by the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth|Melko]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 241-1</ref><ref>{{LT2|I}}, ''passim'' (cf.

He was well-liked by the [[Hounds]] of [[Hisilómë]] and friend of [[Huan]]'s.

{{quote|I am no captain. Neither office nor rank nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the [[Third Company of the Citadel]].|Beregond, in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[Minas Tirith (chapter)|Minas Tirith]]""}} 

'''Beregond''', son of [[Baranor (Man of Gondor)|Baranor]], was a soldier of Gondor and later Captain of the [[White Company]].

==History==
===Early life===
Beregond's fathers were from the vales of the [[White Mountains]], and prior to that they lived in [[Ithilien]].<ref name=""MT"" /> Beregond had two sons, [[Bergil]], who was ten years of age at the time of the [[War of the Ring]],<ref name=""MT"" /> and a younger son named [[Borlas]].<ref name=""New"">{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>

Beregond was a member of the [[Third Company of the Citadel|Third Company]] of the [[Guard of the Citadel|Citadel]]. He admired Faramir and saw him as a brave warrior and a great leader. Beregond did not travel outside of [[Minas Tirith]] often but understood the threat that [[Sauron]] posed to the city.<ref name=""MT"">{{RK|MT}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
On the morning of [[9 March|March 9]]th, {{TA|3019}}, Beregond was assigned to help [[Peregrin Took]] who had just become a Guard of the Citadel. As Beregond had never met a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] before, he was eager to meet Pippin and he was astounded that Pippin looked much like a child yet had faced more dangers than most Men of Gondor.<ref name=""MT"" />

====Battle of Pelennor Fields====
[[File:Maureval - The judgement on Beregond.jpg|thumb|left|Maureval - ''The judgement on Beregond'']]
During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], Beregond was on watch as the sentinel at the gate of the Citadel. Pippin rushed to tell him that Denethor was attempting to burn Faramir alive. Beregond knew his duty of protecting Faramir was more important than to remain at his post so he rushed to his Captain at the [[Silent Street]]. The guard to the street would not let him pass and Beregond was forced to kill him so he could enter. He regretted his decision but he was forced to act quickly. Two more servants of Denethor's guard were killed as they attempted to light the funeral pyre. He stood upon the steps with his sword to ward off the rest until [[Gandalf]] arrived. After Faramir was rescued, Denethor would still not give up, and drew a knife to attempt to kill his son, but Beregond stepped forward to block Denethor. Denethor then gave up and set himself on fire and died.<ref name=""Siege"">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>

After helping to carry Faramir to the [[Houses of Healing]], Gandalf gave the key to the [[Fen Hollen|Closed Door]] to the injured Faramir. Beregond stood guard over Faramir at the Houses of Healing and was present when he awoke.<ref name=""houses"">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

====Battle of the Morannon====
Pippin and Beregond served under the command of [[Imrahil]] at the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. When a Troll-chief charged their ranks, Beregond was stunned and nearly killed, but Pippin managed to save his friend by killing the Troll, which fell on top of him.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref>

===Later life===
Upon [[Aragorn]]'s coronation on [[1 May|May 1]]st, Beregond was brought forward to receive judgement for leaving his post and for killing Denethor's guards on hallowed ground. The penalty would have been death, but the King showed mercy as the deeds were done out of love for Faramir, and Beregond was merely dismissed from the Guard of the Citadel. For his bravery in battle, Aragorn appointed him the Captain of the Guard of Faramir, which was also called the White Company. He later went to live in [[Emyn Arnen]] in [[Ithilien]] to serve his lord, Faramir, the new [[Prince of Ithilien]].<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Beregond'' may stem from ''[[Beren#Etymology|beren]]'' meaning (""bold"") and ''[[gond]]'' (""stone"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> He was likely named after [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|the steward bearing the same name]].

==Genealogy==
Beregond was descended from people of the vales of the White Mountains and Ithilien. What exactly his relation to [[Iorlas]], described only as an uncle of Bergil,<ref name=""MT"" /> was, is unknown.

{{Quote|They say also that the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves return to live again in their own kin and to bear once more their ancient names: of whom Durin was the most renowned...|[[The Silmarillion]], ""[[Of Aulë and Yavanna]]""}}

'''Durin I''', or '''Durin the Deathless''' (known as such due to his longevity) was the eldest of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], the founder of the city of [[Khazad-dûm]], and the first [[King of Durin's folk]]. 

==History==
===Origin===
{{main|Fathers of the Dwarves}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Aulë and the Seven Fathers.jpg‎|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Aulë and the Seven Fathers'']]
Durin was the eldest of the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] fashioned under a mountain by the [[Vala]] [[Aulë]] who yearned for the arrival of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]. The Vala instructed his creations in the [[Khuzdul|speech]] he had devised for them. When [[Ilúvatar]] pointed out that this was against His plans, and reprimanded him, and that Aulë, as a Vala, had no power to make animate creations. Aulë repented and was about to destroy his creation but Ilúvatar himself gave them independent life; and said that they shall sleep until after the coming of the [[Elves]], who were to be his Firstborn.<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>

Aulë laid the sleeping fathers and their mates in deep places; Durin had none.<ref>{{L|212}}</ref> He was set to sleep under [[Mount Gundabad]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] in the [[Years of the Trees]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  

===Reign===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Durin I Discovers the Three Peaks.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Durin I Discovers the Three Peaks'']]
When Durin awoke in the [[First Age]], he journeyed south alone through the wild where no person ever wandered before, and gave name to ""nameless hills and dells"".<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref> He came upon [[Kheled-zâram]] and looking upon [[Seven Stars|mysterious stars]] set [[Durin's Crown|like a crown]] reflected in its surface, he took this as a sign and erected [[Durin's Stone]] on the location of that event.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> There, in the caves above the lake, he founded the city of [[Khazad-dûm]] and for many years, it was the greatest Dwarven city in Middle-earth.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Durin founded the [[House of Durin]] and his people became known as [[Durin's folk]], or the [[Longbeards]]. His people were Dwarves that joined him from other kindreds west and east.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #24</ref>

He lived to a great age, even by the measure of the Dwarves, until he was known as ""the [[Deathless]]""; however, he was not actually immortal, and died before the end of the [[First Age]] and his tomb was in [[Khazad-dûm]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

==Legacy==
The Longbeards believed that Durin would return seven times, and each time he will again be named Durin and reign as King. According to the legend recorded in the [[Red Book]], these returns would be through an heir born into his line, an individual held to be Durin reborn, with same appearance, character and name.<ref name=""Durin""/>

Durin would not actually reincarnate in the sense of him being born and reborn in a new body. Rather, his original body was preserved, and his spirit would return to it and be granted life again. He would share this trait along with the other fathers of the Dwarves.<ref>{{NM|P2xv}}p. 264-265</ref>

[[Durin's Axe]], a great heirloom of Durin's folk, may have been his personal weapon although the canonicity of this is not certain; it was apparently found when [[Balin]] and [[Balin's folk|his colony]] came to Khazad-dûm in {{TA|2989}}.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref><ref>{{App|B2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In-universe, the name ''Durin ''was a word for ""king"" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> 

In reality, ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.<ref name=""IE"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 223</ref><ref name=""Gould"">Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref> The name means ""Sleepy""<ref name=""Gould""/> or ""Sleeper""<ref name=""IE""/>. [[Jim Allan]] noted that ""the Sleeper"" is a good outer name for the Longbeards to give to their first king, who was prophesied to one day awake again from his sleep.<ref name=""IE""/>

'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Durin I.jpg|thumb|150px|Durin I in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]
:Durin I appears in several flashbacks telling the history of Gundabad. His early rule was marked by clashes with the servants of [[Morgoth]], which led Durin to search for a new home for his people to the south. After finding [[Mithril|true-silver]] near [[Kheled-zâram]], Durin took the majority of his people there to found [[Khazad-dûm]], leaving the rest to be ruled by his closest friend Mótsog in Gundabad. Hearing no word from Durin for many long years, Mótsog grew jealous of him and proclaimed himself King in open rebellion.

:Fearing an ambush in Gundabad where secret entrances were known only to Durin himself, Mótsog build for himself a new stronghold to the south, Biriz-zahar. A bloody civil war followed, in which dwarves slew one another. Eventually, Durin himself was captured by Mótsog and put to mockery. His Queen Ragna the Fierce led a daring rescue attempt, which was interrupted when Morgoth saw a chance to destroy the Longbeards at their weakest. [[Sauron]] send nine [[dragon]]s and at least one [[balrog]] to assault Biriz-zahar, as well as countless [[orc]]s. 

:Facing extinction, Durin convinced Mótsog to abandon the feud and to fight against the common foe. Through grievous losses, the dwarves won the day, killing five dragons and many thousands of orcs. Durin gave mercy to the few surviving rebels, though as penance they and their descendants were made to shear their beards for many generations after. The fate of Mótsog himself was not known, but it was believed in later ages that Durin slew the traitor.

'''Durin III''' (fl. {{SA|1600}}s) was the [[King of Durin's folk]] who ruled the great [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]-city of [[Khazad-dûm]] at the time of Sauron's [[Sack of Eregion|assault]] on [[Eregion]]. 

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]], he was given the name of the first [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves|Father of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name=""Durin""/>

During his reign in the 16th century of the Second Age, the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] had struck a rare friendship with the [[Elves of Eregion]].  Around {{SA|1500}}, the Elves, guided by [[Annatar]], began forging the [[Rings of Power]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> According to the Dwarves, [[Celebrimbor]] and the Elven-smiths gave Durin the first of the [[Seven Rings]] of the Dwarves (other traditions state that [[Celebrimbor]] was said to have yielded the Seven - all the Seven - to [[Sauron]] after torture and it was Sauron who gifted the ring to Durin).<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Their instructor in crafting the Rings, the wise [[Annatar]], was actually [[Sauron]] who had come to corrupt the Elves through the Rings of Power. By {{SA|1697}}, seeing that he could not control either the Elves nor the Dwarves through the Rings, he led a large army towards Eregion. In response, Durin sent a great force of Dwarves to the aid of [[Celebrimbor]], but with the [[Sack of Eregion|fall of Eregion]], his warriors were driven back and the [[Doors of Durin]] were shut. Their actions were not in vain for it was by the aid of Durin that [[Elrond]] was able to escape and establish the refuge of [[Imladris]] in the North.<ref name=""Galadriel"">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

Sauron's assault on Eregion was only the beginning of his campaign of conquest. His servants also invaded [[Gundabad]] and the [[Ered Mithrin]], cutting off communications between Durin III and the [[Iron Hills]]. Consequently, the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] came to an end during his reign.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>  Although [[Eregion]] was conquered, Durin III's people were too numerous and valiant, and his halls too deep and strong, to be taken by Sauron.<ref name=""Durin""/>

==Etymology==
One account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for ""king"" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> 

Another account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.

'''Durin IV''' was a King of [[Durin's folk]] who ruled the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], and the fourth king to have the name Durin. Like his father he bore a [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]], he was given the name of the first of the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Durin V's story is expanded on in a series of quests. During his reign, the dragon Thorog took Helegrod, a northern city of his kingdom located near the source of the [[Bruinen]]. Durin took up the axe Mírdanant, a gift from the [[elves]] of [[Eregion]] to his ancestors, and led a small company of dwarves to reclaim the city. Durin and Thorog killed each other, and only one dwarf of his company survived to tell the story.

:Helegrod was left abandoned by the dwarves. Mírdanant was said to be blessed by the elves with words of protection, and so the death of the king while bearing the axe and its loss in the abandoned city was a source of tension between Durin's Folk and the elves. A quest in the game involves reclaiming Mírdanant from the reanimated carcass of Thorog and returning it to the elves of [[Rivendell]], who in turn return it to [[Glóin]].

'''Durin VI''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1731|n}} – {{TA|1980|n}}, lived 249 years) was a King of Durin's folk and ruled at their capital, the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Father of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name=""Durin""/>

Near the end of Durin VI's reign, the Dwarves, mining for ''[[mithril]]'',  encountered a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] that had hidden itself deep beneath the city. The monster began to wreak havoc on Khazad-dûm and slew Durin. Since the surviving Dwarves were unsure what type of monster they faced, the Balrog was simply called ""[[Durin's Bane]]"". Durin's son [[Náin I]] was slain shortly thereafter, leaving his grandson [[Thráin I]] to lead Durin's folk as the survivors fled from their ancestral home.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
One account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for ""king"" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> 

Another account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
: Prince Durin is the son of King [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]]. In the game's storyline other Dwarves have been given that name and yet proved not to be the Father of the Longbeards returned, so a major part of his motivation is to prove whether he truly is or will be Durin VII.

: At the onset of the [[War of the Ring]], Thorin III send Durin to the [[Iron Hills]] for his safety, where to his frustration the Prince had sat out the entire war in relative comfort. Seeking to prove himself, he follows a group of the [[Ironfists|Zhélruka]] dwarves on the pilgrimage to [[Ered Mithrin]], where they believe their old strongholds can be reclaimed following [[Sauron]]'s downfall. Despite his son disobeying his direct order, King Thorin puts his trust in him and sends to him both warriors from [[Erebor]] for reinforcements and the Red Axe of [[Dáin Ironfoot]].

: The dwarves reclaim Skarháld, a fortress outpost of [[Dáin's hall]]s, but Durin sets his sights on a grander prize. Boosted by [[Longbeard]] reinforements coming from [[Eriador]] to [[Iron Hills]], Durin marches on [[Gundabad]] itself which is now ruled by Gorgar, son of [[Bolg]]. In summer of [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], the ""War of Three Peaks"" breaks out, in which the dwarves emerge victorious due to the [[orcs]] being undermined by both [[Angmar]]im cultists and the [[Hobgoblins]] from the North. Deep beneath Gundabad, Durin has an experience that causes him to remember his previous lives and confidently assert himself as Durin the Deathless returned.

'''Ecthelion II''' ([[Third Age]] 2886<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref> – 2984,<ref name=""South"">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 98 years) was the twenty-fifth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]]. He succeeded his father [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]] at his death in Third Age 2953. 

==History==
Ecthelion was the son of Steward [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]]. Two years before his reign, [[Sauron]] had declared himself openly.<ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref><ref name=stew/>

Ecthelion was known as a man of wisdom, and used all his power to strengthen Gondor against the new threat. He encouraged worthy men from Gondor or outside to enter into his service, giving ranks and rewarding the best of them. One was the stranger [[Thorongil]] who came from King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]]. Ecthelion loved him above all, and appreciated him more than his own son, Denethor; the Gondorians even believed that there was rivalry between the two. The stranger also advised him not to trust [[Saruman]] in [[Isengard]], but to welcome [[Gandalf]] (whom Denethor didn't trust).<ref name=stew/> 

[[Gandalf]] was also a welcome guest in [[Minas Tirith]] at the time. Ecthelion also strengthened [[Pelargir]] and refortified [[Cair Andros]].<ref name=""Elendil""/>

Thorongil warned Ecthelion that if Sauron started open war, the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] would be a great threat for the [[Southern Fiefs]]. Ecthelion gave his leave to Thorongil to go to [[Umbar]] and in {{TA|2980}} he severely damaged the [[Corsairs]]' fleet in a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]]. Great honor awaited Thorongil in [[Minas Tirith]] but he never returned; he sent a farewell message to Ecthelion saying that other tasks call him and didn't know if fate would bring him again to Gondor. It later transpired that Thorongil was [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].<ref name=ta/><ref name=stew>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Ecthelion was followed by his son [[Denethor]] at his death in 2984.<ref name=""South""/>

==Etymology==
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Ecthelion#Etymology|Ecthelion - Etymology]]. It is possible that Ecthelion II was named after the [[Noldor|Noldo]] hero of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref>

{{quote|You were born at the end of a great age, Elanorellë|[[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=""Epilogue"">{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref>}}
'''Elanor Fairbairn (née Gamgee or Gardner)''' was the first child of Master [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his wife [[Rose Cotton]]. 
==Life==
Called ""The Fair"" for her golden hair, she was born 25 March {{SR|1421|n}} by [[Shire Calendar|Shire Reckoning]] (which was {{TA|3021}}), which was at the same time the first day of the [[Fourth Age]] in Gondor.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> Elanor was also the only one of Samwise's children known to the Ringbearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], and her name was a suggestion by him.<ref name=""Havens""/>

In {{SR|1436}} Elanor became a maid of honour to Queen [[Arwen|Arwen Evenstar]], and in {{SR|1442}} she rode to [[Gondor]] with her parents and stayed there for a year. In {{SR|1451|n}} she married [[Fastred of Greenholm]]. [[Fourth Age 34|Four years later]], Fastred was named [[Warden of Westmarch]] by the [[Thain]] at the request of Samwise, and the couple moved to the [[Undertowers]] on the [[Tower Hills]].<ref name=later>{{App|Later}}</ref>

She last saw her father in {{SR|1482|n}} when he came to the [[Tower Hills]], passing to her the [[Red Book]]. so Elanor and her line became the keepers of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], and handed down the tradition that Sam passed to the [[Undying Lands]].<ref name=later/> 

Her two children were [[Elfstan Fairbairn|Elfstan]], born in {{SR|1454|n}},<ref name=later/> and [[Fíriel Fairbairn|Fíriel]].<ref>{{AB|Preface}}, note 2</ref> Her descendants (becoming known as the [[Fairbairn Family|Fairbairns of the Towers]]) would live for many generations.<ref name=later/>

==Etymology==
The name is a reference to the ''[[Elanor (flower)|sun-star]]'', a little golden flower blooming in the land of [[Lothlórien]] — this perfectly satisfied Sam's desire for a name that was both [[Elvish]] and yet at the same time a simple flower-name as many hobbit-lasses had.<ref name=""Havens"">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Besides her presence as an infant in the last chapter of the published ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the details noted in the appendices of that book, Elanor's most significant role was in the two versions of the written but unpublished [[The Epilogue|epilogue]] of ''The Lord of the Rings''. In that epilogue Elanor talks with her father about the importance of the events that transpired in the story and also about the coming of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and Queen Arwen for a visit. Elanor's affectionate name for her father is ""Sam-dad"", while Sam calls her ""''Elanorellë''"".<ref name=""Epilogue""/>

'''Eärendil the Mariner''' was one of the [[Half-elven]], and an important figure in the legends of the [[Elder Days]]. Descended from all [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]], he was the first known person to reach [[Aman]] in the [[First Age]] after the [[Noldor]] went into [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. He was crucial in the [[War of Wrath]] and the patriarch of the line of the [[Kings of Númenor]] through his son [[Elros]]. 

==History==
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Travelling South.jpg|thumb|left|''Travelling South'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]
The son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], daughter of King [[Turgon]], Eärendil was raised as a child in [[Gondolin]]. Eärendil was seven years old when [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin fell]], and narrowly escaped death at the hands of his kinsman [[Maeglin]] during the battle. He was borne out on the shoulders of Idril's house-carle [[Hendor]]. As they rested in [[Nan-tathren]], the waters of [[Ulmo]] awoke the [[sea-longing]] in both father and son.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>

He lived afterwards in [[Arvernien]] by the [[Havens of Sirion]]. Eärendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married [[Elwing]], daughter of [[Dior]], the son of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]. They had two sons, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]].

With the aid of [[Círdan]] the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, ''[[Vingilótë]]'' (or ''Vingilot''), and sailed around the seas west of Middle-earth for two purposes: to seek after Tuor and Idril who did not return, and to perhaps find Aman and so bring the message of Elves and Men to the Valar in the West before he died - resulting him leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the [[Silmaril]] that Beren had wrested from [[Morgoth]]. News of this came to the remaining sons of [[Fëanor]], and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, killing most of them. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself and the Silmaril into the sea. The Silmaril was not lost, however:
[[File:Steamey - Eärendil and Elwing.jpg|thumb|left|''Eärendil and Elwing'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]
{{blockquote|For [[Ulmo]] bore up Elwing out of the waves, and he gave her the likeness of a great white bird, and upon her breast there shone as a star the Silmaril, as she flew over the water to seek Eärendil her beloved. On a time of night Eärendil at the helm of his ship saw her come towards him, as a white cloud exceeding swift beneath the moon, as a star over the sea moving in strange courses, a pale flame on wings of storm. And it is sung that she fell from the air upon the timbers of Vingilot, in a swoon, nigh unto death for the urgency of her speed, and Eärendil took her to his bosom; but in the morning with marveling eyes he beheld his wife in her own form beside him with her hair upon his face, and she slept.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]""}}

Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after [[Valinor]], and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the [[Valar]], and asked them to aid the Men and Elves in Middle-earth and fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.

Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, [[Manwë]] forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due. Because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the [[Half-elven]]). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.

{{blockquote|But when all was spoken, Manwë gave judgement, and he said: 'In this matter the power of doom is given to me. The peril that he ventured for love of the Two Kindreds shall not fall upon Eärendil, nor shall it fall upon Elwing his wife, who entered into peril for love of him; but they shall not walk again ever among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands. And this is my decree concerning them: to Eärendil and to Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which kindred they shall be judged.'|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]""}}

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons.jpg|thumb|''Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth and overthrew Morgoth, binding him with a chain forged by the smith [[Aulë]]. Eärendil took part in the battle. His ship Vingilótë was blessed by the Valar, filled with a shining white flame, and sent to the skies. He sailed at its helm with the Silmaril bound upon his brow. Alongside [[Thorondor]] and the [[Eagles]], he slew the great dragon [[Ancalagon]] the Black and cast his body down onto [[Thangorodrim]], the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the [[War of Wrath]], led to the Ruin of [[Beleriand]].

==Legacy==
{{seealso|Star of Eärendil}}
[[File:Matěj Čadil - The Star of Earendil.jpg|thumb|left|''The Star of Earendil'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]
Eärendil lived in Valinor, and the gleaming of the Silmaril upon his brow could still be seen in the skies of the distant West as the bright Evening Star.<ref name=""S24"">{{S|24}}</ref> Those who remained in Middle-earth called it '''Gil-Estel''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ""Star of High Hope"").

In the [[Second Age]], the descendants of the [[Edain]] followed the [[Star of Eärendil]] to reach [[Elenna]]. When [[Númenor]] fell under the [[Shadow]], [[Tar-Atanamir]] mentioned Eärendil's fate to argue about [[immortality]] to the Messengers of the [[Valar]]. The Messengers responded that his was a fate apart as a Half-elven, and he was bound to the sky, unable to return, whereas the [[Númenóreans]] demanded the liberties of both Elves and Men.<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

[[Bilbo Baggins]] wrote the ''[[Eärendillinwë]]''<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> and the legend of Eärendil also inspired the poem ''[[Errantry]]''.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Earendil.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Eärendil'' was his given [[father-name]]. ''Eärendil'' is a [[Quenya]] name, meaning ""Devoted to the Sea"", literally ""Sea lover"".<ref>{{L|211}}, answer to Question 4</ref><ref>{{L|131|18}}</ref> It is a compound of ''[[eär]]'' and ''[[-ndil]]''.<ref>{{L|297}}</ref><ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''eär'', ''(n)dil''</ref>

Tolkien used the original [[Old English]] name '''''Eärendel''''' for his early [[Legendarium]], which he envisioned as Elvish, derived form the [[Qenya]] words ''ea'' (""eagle"") and ''earen'' (""eyre""); the exact meaning of the name remained unclear.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 251, entry ""Eärendel""</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Sindarin]] cognate for ''Eärendil'' was '''''Gaerdil''''', with variations like ''Gaerdilion'' and ''Gaerennil''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 19, 27</ref> There are also experimental [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] forms, such as ''Aerendil'' and ''Aerennel'',<ref>{{PM|XI}}: Note 52</ref> as well as a direct translation: ''Seron Aearon''.<ref name=""Name"" />

His [[mother-name]] was '''''Ardamírë''''', a prophetic name, as it means ""Jewel of the World"", from ''[[arda]]'' (""world"") + ''[[mírë]]'' (""jewel""). Its [[Sindarin]] version was '''''Mír n'Ardhon'''''.<ref name=""Name"">{{PM|XI}}: ''The names of Finwë's descendants'', p. 348</ref>

''Eärendil'' was translated as '''''[[Azrubêl]]''''' in [[Adûnaic]], from ''azar'' (""sea"") and the stem ''bel-''.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, p. 373</ref>

Eärendil was known by many epithets: Half-elven,<ref>{{S|23}}</ref> [[the Blessed]],<ref>{{S|17}}</ref> Bright,<ref name=""S24"" /><ref name=""Akallabeth"" /> and the Mariner.<ref name=""S24"" /><ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early poems===
Before conceiving any story for his [[legendarium|mythology]], [[Tolkien]] wrote some poems that dealt with Eärendel. The earliest was ''[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast]]'', which would set the foundations for ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' as Tolkien ""tried to find out"" what it was about.<ref>{{B|III}}, p. 71</ref> The other poems were ''[[The Bidding of the Minstrel]]'', ''[[The Shores of Faëry]]'' and ''[[The Happy Mariners]]'', all written between [[1914]]-[[1915]].<ref name=""Earendel"">{{LT2|V}}</ref>{{rp|267–273}} The four poems tell in a lyric way about the coming of Eärendel to Valinor, the rising of his boat as the morning star and his everlasting travel in the edge of the world. 

''The Bidding of the Minstrel'' is associated with a noted page, which outlines the travels of Eärendel to the North, visiting Island, Iceland, magic lands and seeing [[Kôr]] from afar; then he goes South, travelling through the Mediterranean or Atlantic sea, full of strange creatures. Then he travels to the western lip of the world and sails upon the sky, never coming back. ''The Shores of Faëry'' has a short preface in prose, which, as in the former text, conceives Eärendel as an old man when travelling to the firmament.<ref name=""Earendel"" />{{rp|261–262}}

===The Book of Lost Tales===
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Ecthelion and Earendil.jpg|thumb|''Ecthelion and Earendil'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
In the earliest narrative of the legendarium in ''The Book of Lost Tales'', the birth of Eärendel is first prophesied of by [[Ulmo]] to [[Tuor]]: ""''...and of a surety a child shall come of thee than whom no man shall know more of the uttermost deeps, be it of the sea or of the firmament of heaven.''""<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|155}} Years later, the wishes of the [[Valar]] were fulfilled when Eärendel was born from Tuor and [[Idril]] in [[Gondolin]]:

{{blockquote|Now this babe was of greatest beauty; his skin of a shining white and his eyes of a blue surpassing that of the sky in southern lands — bluer than the sapphires of the raiment of [[Manwë]]; and the envy of [[Meglin]] was deep at his birth, but the joy of [[Turgon]] and all the people very great indeed.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|165}}}}

Now Eärendel was still of tender years when the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began. The red lights of the enemy appeared in the walls of his room, which made him cry, as his nurse [[Meleth (nurse)|Meleth]] had told him dark stories about [[Melko]]. His mother Idril came and arrayed him with a tiny coat of mail, which cheered him up greatly.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|174}} When the battle had just begun at the northern part of the city, Meglin and his [[folk of the Mole]] came to the house of Tuor and seized Idril. Tuor and his [[folk of the Wing]] appeared there when Meglin was dragging Idril and Eärendel to the walls, as he wished to cast out the child while the mother saw it. Seeing that Tuor was coming, Meglin tried to stab Eärendel, but the child bit his hand and the coat turned the blade aside. After killing Meglin, Tuor gave Idril some of his men and left to battle.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|177–178}}

During the siege of Gondolin, Idril remained in the doors of her house, till she could wait no longer, so she sent most of her bodyguard down [[Idril's secret way|her secret tunnel]] with Eärendel, while she stayed there.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|187}} Later, when the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] came out of the city to the plain, Tuor saw a group of men being chased by [[wolf-riders]]: ""''Lo! there is Eärendel my son; behold, his face shineth as a star in the waste...''"". About Eärendel were some men of the Wing, and he was being carried by [[Hendor]], a house-carle. By the order of Tuor, they stopped running and were saved from the Orcs. The child was happy of seeing his father, who took him upon his shoulders. Later, when reunited with his mother, Eärendel refused to be carried by her, as she was clearly tired, and asked for [[Salgant]], who was a friend of them in Gondolin. But as when he asked for [[Ecthelion]] and Gondolin, his parents explained they were all fallen.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|190–191}} After a year of wanderings, the Exiles settled down in the [[Mouths of Sirion|mouth of Sirion]], and there Eärendel grew fair in the house of his father.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|196–197}}

Tolkien never finished [[the Tale of Eärendel]], which is only given in dispersed outlines. It is practically impossible to summarise them in a coherent way.

===Later versions===
In the first sketch of the ''Silmarillion'' ([[1926]]) intended to ""reboot"" the legendarium, Eärendel slew Ungoliant.<ref>{{SM|2}}</ref>

''Earendel'' is also mentioned in [[The Notion Club Papers]], where Tolkien finally changed the name to ''Earendil'', and remained so.

==Inspiration==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Eärendil heraldic device (II).jpg|right|thumb|100px|One of the three heraldic devices [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] designed for Eärendil]]
While ''Eärendil'' is a [[Quenya]] name inside the [[legendarium]], Tolkien created the name based on [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''éarendel''. He says that he was struck by the ""great beauty"" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as ""entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language.""<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 385</ref>

Tolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse ''[[:Wikipedia:Aurvandill|Aurvandill]]'', Lombardic ''Auriwandalo''), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]''.<ref>{{SD|Notion}}</ref> The [[Old Norse]] together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in ''Crist'' christianized to refer to John the Baptist).

Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in ''[[Wikipedia:Christ I|Christ]]'', which became the title of [[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast|his first poem about Eärendel]]:

{{blockquote|éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended<br>
""Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / sent over Middle-earth to men.""}}

This first line is paralleled by [[Eönwë]] when Eärendil reaches Aman: ""''Hail Eärendil, of mariners most renowned, [...] Hail Eärendil, bearer of light before the Sun and Moon!''"".<ref name=""S24"" /> It also inpires [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s exclamation in [[Shelob's Lair]], ""''[[Aiya Eärendil elenion ancalima!]]''"",<ref>{{TT|IV9}}</ref> which translates as ""Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!"". Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the ""[[Phial of Galadriel|Star-glass]]"" he carried, which contained the light of [[Star of Eärendil|Eärendil's star]], the [[Silmaril]] he wore upon his brow.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''Faramir''' was the last [[Ruling Steward|Ruling]] [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] and the first [[Prince of Ithilien]]. 

The second of [[Denethor]]'s two sons, Faramir was briefly the [[Ruling Steward]] after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]], he laid down his office, but Elessar renewed the hereditary appointment of Steward as the advisor to the King. Faramir was also appointed Prince of Ithilien.<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 207</ref>

==History==
Faramir was born in {{TA|2983}}, five years after [[Boromir]]. Faramir was five when his mother [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]] died. When that happened, Boromir and Faramir formed a great bond with each other. 
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Brothers study.jpg|left|thumb|''Brothers study'' by Catherine Chmiel]]
He grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother, he did not care much for battle and arms and needless danger. He gained from the wisdom of [[Gandalf]] who visited [[Minas Tirith]], and loved lore and music; his gentle nature (and love of Gandalf) displeased his father. Although Denethor grew cold and grim and favoured Boromir over him, there was no rivalry between the brothers; Boromir was always his helper and protector.<ref name=""stew"">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Twice Faramir had a [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|prophetic dream]] and didn't speak about it, until he saw it again with his brother. [[20 June|The following day]] saw [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]] which started the [[War of the Ring]]. The two brothers commanded the defences of [[Osgiliath]]. They protected the last bridge across the [[Anduin]] until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.<ref name=""council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Seeking clues for the dream, Boromir set out for [[Rivendell]].<ref name=""council"" /> Faramir never heard from his brother again, until the [[Great Horn]] was heard in Minas Tirith, and a few days later he saw Boromir dead in a funeral boat, prepared by [[Fellowship of the Ring|his companions]], floating the Anduin.<ref name=""appB"">{{App|Great}}</ref>

On [[1 March]], his father sent him for an errand to Ithilien where Faramir went to command the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].<ref name=""appB"" />
===In Ithilien===
[[File:John Howe - Faramir 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Faramir'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Faramir acted as a ranger harassing [[Haradrim]] and keeping evil things from entering Ithilien from [[Minas Morgul]]. During one such raid he found [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gollum]] observing an attack by his rangers on a column of [[Haradrim]]. The former two were captured as spies by the rangers though Gollum eluded them. Frodo was questioned by Faramir concerning their errand. Frodo recounted the journeys of the Fellowship and its members but referred to the [[Quest of the Ring|purpose]] of the travels only cryptically. During the questioning he denied knowledge of Gollum but revealed that he travelled with both Aragorn, the [[Heir of Isildur]], and Boromir.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Window on the West.jpg|thumb|''The Window on the West'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Faramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement in it, though Frodo had not known of Boromir's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Faramir led Frodo and Sam, blindfolded, to [[Henneth Annûn]]. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the hobbits' errand was linked to the 'Isildur's bane' that had sent Boromir to Rivendell in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Faramir delivered his famous oath, saying that he ""...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs"". In a slip up however Samwise revealed the nature of 'Isildur's bane' and so Faramir was tested, just as Boromir had been, by the lure of [[The One Ring|The Ring]]. Where Boromir failed Faramir succeeded, leading Samwise to remark that Faramir had ""shown [his] quality"".<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>

During the night, Faramir's watch spotted Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Faramir called Frodo to him who confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, begging Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. [[8 March|The following morning]]<ref name=""appB"" /> Faramir released Frodo and Sam (with Gollum), but warned them strongly against taking the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{TT|IV6}}</ref> Faramir with his men also left the refuge [[9 March|the next day]].<ref name=""appB"" />

===In Pelennor/Minas Tirith===
Faramir returned to Osgiliath, supervising the defence there. However he retreated over the [[Pelennor Fields]] to report to Denethor on [[10 March]]<ref name=""appB"" /> and was almost caught by the [[Nazgûl]] on their [[Fell beasts]], but was saved by Gandalf. Faramir reached Minas Tirith, telling Denethor and Gandalf of what befell in Ithilien, but [[11 March|the next day]] he departed to Osgiliath<ref name=""appB"" /> to supervise the defences at his father's bidding. In this venture the host of the [[Witch-king]] came upon Osgiliath and on [[12 March]] Faramir retreated to the [[Causeway Forts]].<ref name=""appB"" /> He was struck down by the [[Black Breath]] and only a sortie by [[Imrahil]] and his knights saved the wounded (including Faramir) from that onset and on [[13 March]] they were brought to Minas Tirith.<ref name=""appB"" /><ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Sun Unveiled.jpg|thumb|''The Sun Unveiled'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Faramir remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Ring. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] Denethor planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Faramir was once again saved by Gandalf, though Denethor completed his suicide.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref> After this he was taken to the [[Houses of Healing]] and healed by Aragorn after the battle.<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref> Faramir spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met [[Éowyn]], also grievously wounded.<ref name=""RK|VI5"">{{RK|VI5}}</ref> The two fell in love and were married after the war.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

===After the War of the Ring===
After the destruction of the One Ring and the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Faramir, as Steward, led the ceremony in the crowning of Aragorn as King of Gondor and Arnor.<ref name=""RK|VI5""/> Aragorn reinstated the original role of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] before the failing of the [[Kings of Gondor]] and made Faramir the Prince of Ithilien. As Prince of Ithilien, Faramir was one of the two Chief Commanders of King Elessar and his duty was to guard and maintain the eastern borders of Gondor. He also defeated the remaining enemies and cleansed the [[Morgul Vale]].

Faramir and Éowyn settled down in [[Emyn Arnen]], a range of hills in Ithilien in sight of Minas Tirith, and Faramir became the [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]]. He and Éowyn had at least one son named [[Elboron]],<ref name=""Elboron"" /> who followed his father as Steward and Prince of Ithilien when Faramir died in the year {{FoA|82}}. Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large percentage of pure [[Dúnedain]] ancestry he possessed as a member of the Gondorian nobility.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Faramir'' is never glossed, and neither is indicated if it is [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]].

As all the Kings of Gondor and their heirs had names in Quenya,<ref>{{App|F1ii}}</ref> and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] son of [[Ondoher]]) the name apparently is Quenya.

==Inspiration==
Faramir was, in the words of Tolkien, ""modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful"".<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> His appearance toward the end of ''[[The Two Towers]]'' apparently was as much of a surprise to Tolkien as it is to his readers. ""I am sure I did not invent him,"" he wrote. ""I did not even want him, though I like him"".<ref>{{L|66}}</ref> 

Faramir in many ways speaks for Tolkien, who was an officer in the British Army during [[World War I]], when he says, for example, ""I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness... I love only that which they defend"".<ref name=""Window"">{{TT|Window}}</ref> Much later, Tolkien would write, ""As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir"".<ref>{{L|180}}</ref>

</gallery>

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Faramir's role has been omitted. However, a young black-haired man is shown at Aragorn's coronation, sitting on a horse beside Éowyn. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Faramir. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Faramir is voiced by [[Andrew Seear]]. Because Boromir already named him during the Council of Elrond - in the book, he is simply called ""my brother"" - much of the mystery surrounding Faramir's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. His flight from the Nazgûl across the Pelennor is also omitted. However, unlike some adaptations Faramir's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Éowyn are included, as is his role at Aragorn's coronation.

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Faramir is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Faramir is played by Friedhelm Ptok.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:[[David Wenham]] plays Faramir in this adaptation. He does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them west to Osgiliath, crossing the river Anduin, and not until the Ringwraiths attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character, who is meant to emulate the medieval chivalric code and contrast with Boromir. [[Peter Jackson]]'s explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character ''development'', which meant that Faramir had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring. However, despite these comments, Aragorn still resists the Ring easily at the end of the first movie, which acts as a contradiction to Jackson's claim.

:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and favouring Boromir, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Faramir's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.

'''2002-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Faramir is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Faramir's brother Boromir earlier in the radio series.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Faramir's role in the War of the Ring is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Minas Tirith Faramir has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Elessar's coronation. Afterwards, Aragorn charges the Steward and the Rangers of Ithilien with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale. Faramir leads the Rangers to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins [[Damrod]]'s team inside the walls Minas Morgul itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.

Fíriel was wed to prince [[Arvedui]] of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1940}} when Arvedui's father [[Araphant]] made an alliance with Ondoher.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, 'Ondohir', p. 201</ref> The alliance proved fruitless, however. Neither side could send help to the other as both Kingdoms came under attack: Arnor by [[Angmar]] and Gondor by the [[Wainriders]].

During the [[Disaster of the Morannon]], Ondoher and his sons [[Artamir]] and [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] were killed, which meant that according to the Law of [[Númenor]], Fíriel should have become the Ruling Queen. Arvedui referred to this ancient law, as well as the fact that he was a direct descendant of [[Isildur]], as arguments to claim the crown of Gondor, but he was refused.

Fíriel remained with her husband in the north, though her fate in the fall of Arthedain was never recorded. She did have a son, [[Aranarth]], who continued the line of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]].<ref name=""Gondor""/>

== Legacy ==
However, approximately more than a millennium after her death,<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for May 1, 3019, p. 1095</ref> the Crown of Gondor finally returned to her descendants at the end of the [[War of the Ring]] when her descendant [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]] son of [[Arathorn II]],<ref>{{App|North}}, p. 1038</ref> claimed the Crown of Gondor as the King Elessar Telcontar.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1043</ref>

==Etymology==
''Fíriel'' is [[Quenya]] for ""mortal woman"".<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

'''Fíriel''' was the fictitious protagonist of the poem ""[[The Last Ship]]"" from ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.

==History==
She awoke before dawn one morning and was drawn downstairs to the nearby river. Running through the morning dew her gown became bejeweled upon its hem.  As she stood gleaming with her hair upon her shoulders, watching a [[kingfishers|kingfisher]], she heard music – flutes, harps, and the voices of [[Elves]]. Soon an Elven ship appeared with some rowing and three wearing crowns. The oarsmen sang of the green land, and when Fíriel asked them where they were going, answered that they are off to [[Elvenhome]].
[[File:Pauline Baynes - Fíriel and the Last Ship.jpg|thumb|250px|right|""Fíriel and the Last Ship"" by [[Pauline Baynes]]]]
However, the oars halted as they spied Fíriel on the shore. Calling the Earth-maiden elven-fair, they offered to take her with them since there was room for one more. Fíriel took one step towards them, but when her foot sank deep into the clay at the water's edge she halted and cried that she could not come, being born a daughter of Earth. Turning away, she walked back to her house, the dew-jewels gone. She put on a russet brown smock, braided her hair, and began that day's chores.

At the critical moment when Fíriel almost joined the departing Elves, it was the sinking of her foot deep into the clay of the riverbank that recalled to her the fact that she was but a mortal.

==Etymology==
In ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', it was said that [[Míriel|Míriel Serindë]], the first wife of [[Finwë]], was renamed ''Fíriel'', meaning ""she that died"". Thus the name ""Fíriel"" is associated with the idea of a mortal woman.<ref>{{MR|P3II3f}}</ref>

'''Fíriel''' was the daughter of [[Orontor]] of [[Númenor]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.

== History ==
She was a fair [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] maiden of the household of [[Elendil]]. While Elendil and his son [[Herendil]] were approaching their house, they heard Fíriel sing a [[Fíriel's song|sad song]] from a high window in the [[Quenya|Eressëan]] tongue that Elendil and [[Herendil]] heard the first two lines of, beginning with ""''Ilu Ilúvatar en káre''"" (""The Father made the World"")<ref name=P1>{{LR|P1III2}}, pp. 62-3</ref><ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 12</ref> and going until her voice fell into the question ""''O Ilúvatar, give me in that day beyond the end, when my Sun faileth?''"" Then Elendil said ""''E man antaváro? What will he give indeed?''"" Herendil complained, saying that she should not be singing such things, as people in Númenor were now singing that [[Melko]] would come back and give them the Sun forever, but his father despised those words.<ref name=Firiel>{{LR|P1III2}}{{rp|62–63}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Fíriel'' is only glossed in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' as a [[Noldorin]] name of [[Lúthien]], meaning ""Mortal Maiden"", from ''feir'' (""mortal""), and ''[[-iel]]'' (""daughter"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""PHIR-""</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
While Tolkien eventually discarded the character of Fíriel, the name would later be used for [[Fíriel (disambiguation)|other characters]] within the [[legendarium]].

'''Galdor''' was a [[Gnome]]-lord of [[Gondolin]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
He was the lord of the [[folk of the Tree]], and like them he probably carried either a great club or spear, and wore green. He was said to be the bravest of the [[Gondothlim]], save King [[Turgon]] himself.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}}

When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, he and his folk were near the northern gate, where [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] led the main attack of [[Melko]]'s armies. When the gates fell, he jumped upon the enemies with his folk and the [[house of the Hammer of Wrath]].<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|176}} But after [[Rog]] and those of the Hammer died outside the walls, the folk of the Tree retreated to the [[Square of the Folkwell]]. There they fought under the [[Arch of Inwë]] until [[Tuor]] entered the square carrying [[Ecthelion]] and being pursued by Orcs. ""There did Galdor become the salvation of Tuor"", because ""the Orcs had taken them both but for the sudden rush of that champion and the dint of his club.""<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|181–2}}

Later on, in the [[Square of the Palace]], Turgon proclaimed the fall of Gondolin, throwing his crown at the roots of [[Glingol]], and it was Galdor who picked the crown up, but the king rejected it.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|185}} 

He joined the [[exiles of Gondolin]], and after crossing [[Idril's secret way]], he encouraged them to run to the [[Encircling Mountains]] before the sunrise.<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|189}} When they reached the [[Cristhorn]], he led a group of men ahead of the survivors. They were the first on crossing the narrow pass and had to fight against an ambush of the Orcs.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|191–3}}

Galdor lived later in the [[Mouths of Sirion|mouth of Sirion]] and survived the battle that Melko made against the people dwelling there. It is said that he later visited the ruins of Gondolin with [[Eärendel]] and now lives in [[Tol Eressëa]], where he still has followers.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 215</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Gnomish]] name ''Galdor'' is never glossed, but in the [[Noldorin]] stage of the language, it is related with the [[root]]s [[GALA]]/[[GALAD]], related with ""thrive"" and ""trees"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""[[GALA]]"", ""[[GALAD]]""</ref>

The [[Qenya]] name of the character was '''''Aldaron''''',<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref> which confirms this relation with the word ""tree"", as it is also the [[Aldaron|name]] of [[Oromë]] meaning ""(King) of the Forests"".<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an outline of the last Lost Tale, Tolkien considered that both Galdor and [[Egalmoth]] led the Noldoli back to Valinor.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 278-9</ref>

In late writings, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] considered that Galdor of Gondolin and [[Galdor of the Havens]] may have been the same, but ultimately rejected the notion. If Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus had fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests. For this reason Tolkien speculated that ''Galdor'' was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, pp. 387-8, notes 1 & 3</ref>

'''Galdor''' was the second child and eldest son of [[Hador]]. He led the [[House of Hador|People of Hador]] when they were at the peak of their power, before the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Galdor was noted for his exceptional height, even among the [[Edain]], and was also called '''Galdor the Tall'''.<ref name=""Ruin""/>

==History==
Galdor had a younger brother named [[Gundor]] and an older sister named [[Glóredhel]].<ref name=""WJwest"">{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador''</ref>

At a great feast of the Edain, Galdor married [[Hareth]] and Glóredhel married [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]], both children of [[Halmir]], chief of the [[House of Haleth]].<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>  Galdor and [[Hareth]] had two sons, [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

In the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}}, both Galdor's father, Hador, and his younger brother, Gundor, died in the rearguard of the Elf-lord [[Fingolfin]].  Galdor then succeeded his father as Lord of [[Dor-lómin]].  In the wake of [[Morgoth]]'s triumph the wife of [[Barahir]], [[Emeldir]], gathered the women and children of [[Dorthonion]] and led them westward; some found refuge in Galdor's domain.

The sons of Galdor, Húrin and Huor, had been taken after the Dagor Bragollach into the hidden city of [[Gondolin]] by the eagles of [[Thorondor]].  When they departed from the city (again carried by eagles) they returned to Dor-lómin where they would not reveal where they had been, even to their father.

Seven years after the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth sent a great force against [[Hithlum]], attacking the passes of the [[Ered Wethrin]].  Galdor defended the [[Eithel Sirion]] and was slain by an arrow.<ref name=""Ruin""/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Galdor.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Galdor'' appears to be [[Sindarin]], but its meaning is unclear. [[David Salo]] suggests it can be a combination of the [[root]] [[gal]] (""light"") and the suffix ''-dor'' (""lord"").<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 350</ref>

'''Galdor''' of the Havens was an [[Elf]] who in the [[Third Age]] lived in [[Mithlond]] under [[Círdan]].
==History==
During the [[War of the Ring]] he was sent in an errand to [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. He was present in the [[Council of Elrond]] representing Círdan. He asked about proofs that the ring of [[Frodo Baggins|the halfling]] was indeed the [[Great Ring]], and also inquired why [[Saruman]] was not with them. It was [[Gandalf]] who answered his questions, narrating his story on how he discovered the One Ring, and Saruman's treachery.

In a later point Galdor mentioned that he knew about the figure of [[Iarwain]], and he agreed with [[Glorfindel]] that he had not the power to defy [[Sauron]] and keep the Ring from him.

Then, he agreed with Gandalf that not even the [[Sea]] could hide the Ring for ever. Galdor expected that the [[Ringwraiths]] (who were recently defeated in [[Bruinen]]) would soon return and [[Gondor]] could not stop Sauron from coming all the way to [[Lindon]] and reach the Sea. These were the last comments before Elrond decided that the only option is to destroy the Ring in [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In late writings, Tolkien speculated that this Galdor and the [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] of ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' may have been the same,<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, pp. 387-388, note 1</ref> but he ultimately rejected the notion: if Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus have Fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, p. 388, note 3</ref> For this reason Tolkien speculated that ""Galdor"" was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.

{{Quote|Greatest was the House of Hador Golden-head, peer of Elven-lords. Many of his people were like him, golden-haired and blue-eyed; they were tall and strong, quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend and to foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty, joyous in heart, the children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind.|[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|The Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']], ""Of the Coming of Men into the West""}}

'''Hador Lórindol''' was the first [[Lord of Dor-lómin]], and the founder of the [[House of Hador]]. He was a direct descendant of [[Marach]], the original leader of the Third House of the Edain, and ancestor to [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]].<ref name=Had>{{WJ|14}}, ''Of the Kindreds and Houses of the Edain'', §31, pp. 223-224</ref>

== History ==
Hador's ancestor, [[Malach]], spent 14 years in the Kingdom of [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]], and became friendly with the Elves. Although neither Hador's grandfather [[Magor]] nor his father [[Hathol]] served under any Elf-lord,<ref name=Gen/> Hador entered Fingolfin's household and was beloved by the king.<ref name=""Swest""/> In {{FA|416}} Fingolfin granted Hador a hereditary fiefdom in [[Dor-lómin]],<ref name=Chi>{{WJ|14}}, p. 228</ref> where he gathered most of the people of his kin, thus forming the noble '''[[House of Hador]]'''. To celebrate the event, prince [[Fingon]] presented him with the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]], for whom it was also called the [[Helm of Hador]].<ref name=Departure>{{UT|2c}}</ref>

Noble Hador was remembered as an [[Elf-friend]] (in his household only [[Elvish]] was spoken<ref name=Had/>), the greatest chieftain of the Edain and peer of Elven-lords, and his House became the greatest of the [[Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]]. He ruled Dor-lómin for 39 years until the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. He commanded the rearguard of his liege Fingolfin at the spring of [[Eithel Sirion]], but was slain along with his youngest son Gundor. In his honor, his descendants would call themselves the [[House of Hador]].<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Thousands of years later, at [[The Council of Elrond]], Hador was named among ""the mighty Elf-friends of old"", along with Húrin, [[Túrin]], and [[Beren]].<ref>{{LR|Council}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Hador Lorindol.mp3|Ardamir}}
:''For the etymology of'' Hador, ''see the article'' [[hador (word)]].

Hador's epithet, ''Lórindol'', is the [[Lenition|lenited]] form of ''Glórindol'',<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1901332585.html|articlename=S. ''Glórindol'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=7 March 2020}}</ref> which is [[Sindarin]] for ""Goldenhead"", from ''[[glaur]]'' (""golden"") and ''[[dol]]'' (""head""),<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''dol'', ''laurë''</ref> a reference to his golden hair. It was a trait shared by many other members of his House.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Early legendarium: three generations ===
On the first introduction of the Edain there was about thirty-five years between their arrival in Beleriand and Morgoth's assault that would become known as the Battle of Sudden Flame. Both the [[House of Bëor]] and the House of Hadar were represented with three generations. In this scheme Hador consistently had five functions:
* Last of the ""Fathers of Men"" to lead his people into Beleriand
* Entered into vassalage under Fingolfin within Hithlum
* Founder of the House of Hador
* Grandfather of Húrin and Huor
* Perished while defending Fingolfin in the Battle of Sudden Flame

On his first conception, Hador ""the tall"" was the leader of one of two houses of Men which entered Beleriand, arriving shortly after the people of [[Bëor]]. His two sons were ''[[Haleth]]'' and ''[[Gumlin]]'', with Gumlin in turn being the father of Húrin and Huor.<ref name=""q9"">{{SM|Q9}}</ref> The people of his son Haleth were the last of the Edain to remain free in Beleriand, being neither penned in Hithlum nor subjugated by Morgoth.<ref>{{SM|Q13}}</ref> 

In emendations to the earliest concept, Hador's epithet was changed to ""the Golden-haired"", Haleth became an unrelated leader of an independent third people (which were the second to enter Beleriand), and Hador's other son became ''[[Gundor]]''.<ref>{{SM|CQ9}}</ref>

Throughout multiple later revisions the duration of the Siege of Angband increased, and the coming of Men pushed forward with it.  Hador's functions thus remained the same.

In ''The Later Annals of Beleriand'', two introductions were of Hador's folk abandoning their own tongue to take the speech of the Elves, and Hador's daughter ''Glorwendel''.<ref name=LR />

In ''The Grey Annals'', Hador joined Fingolfin after hearing that there was room and need of folk in Hithlum. His folk are described as having come from a northland people who were hardy to endure cold and long wandering; thus they did not fear to at times to go far into the North and keep watch on any movements of the Enemy. The date of his people entering Dor-lómin is specified as the year 423.<ref name=ga />

=== Later legendarium: seven generations ===
In ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]'' the entry of Men into Beleriand was pulled back by over a century to the year 310, and thus four additional generations were required.

In the initial new conception Hador kept his chronologically later functions as grandfather of Húrin, and death in the Battle of Sudden Flame. Hador's function as a Father of Men was now given to [[Marach]] and three further generations—[[Malach]], [[Magor]], and [[Hathol]]—were inserted between Marach and Hador. In this conception Hador was in Fingolfin's household between the years 405–415, and was granted the lordship of Dor-lómin in 416.<ref name=west>{{WJ|West}}</ref>

In a final emendation ""Hador Lorindol first lord of Dorlómin"" was moved up to become the son of Malach, and ""Magor Dagorlind the Sword singer in battle"" was moved down as the son of Hathol. While [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not use this last revision for ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', he notes ""that this was not an ephemeral change is seen from the [[Athrabeth]], where Adanel is the sister of Hador Lorindol, not of Magor"". This was also seen in an emendation where Hador replaced Magor, as joining his father Aradan, in talking many of their people westwards, with Hador leading the greater number of his folk down the Sirion to dwell in the vales on the southern slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]].<ref name=west />

'''Isengrim Took II''' was the twenty-second [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]].

==History==
Isengrim II became Thain in {{TA|2683}} and begun to excavate the [[Great Smials]] in [[Green Hill Country]], which would be the Thain's seat for generations to come.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  

During his service the Shire-reform was established in the [[Shire-reckoning]], after which every year of the [[Shire Calendar]] would always begin in [[Sterday]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

During this period also [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] reckoned that [[pipe-weed]] was first cultivated in the [[Southfarthing]] by [[Tobold Hornblower]] <ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref>

Thainship passed on to his son, [[Isumbras Took III|Isumbras III]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
""Isengrim"" is of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and comes from ''isen'' meaning ""iron"" and ''grim'' meaning ""fierce"".

""Isengrim"" is the name of a wolf who appears in many medieval epics, including the story of [[Wikipedia:Reynard the Fox|Reynard the Fox]] which originated in French folklore.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

'''Isengrim Took III''' was the twenty-seventh [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]].
==History==
The eldest son of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], Isengrim's rule was noticeably short. Due to his father's longevity, he was already near his nineties when he became [[Thain]], and ruled for ten years before his death. As he had no children of his own, his brother [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras]] became the new Thain.<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
""Isengrim"" is of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and comes from ''isen'' meaning ""iron"" and ''grim'' meaning ""fierce"".

It is likely Isengrim is named after an earlier [[Isengrim (disambiguation)|Isengrim]], but it is notable that ""Isengrim"" is the name of a wolf who appears in many medieval epics, including the story of [[Wikipedia:Reynard the Fox|Reynard the Fox]] which originated in French folklore.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

'''Lúthien Tinúviel''' was the only daughter of King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] and [[Melian]] the [[Maia]]. She was said to be the fairest maiden amongst all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] to have ever lived, a beauty that would appear again only millennia later on [[Arwen]]. She wedded [[Beren]], a [[Men|Man]], with whom she shared the fate of [[mortality]]. 

==History==
[[File:Alice Falto - Birth of Luthien.jpg|thumb|left|''Birth of Luthien'' by [[:Category:Images by Alice Falto|Alice Falto]]]]
Lúthien was born during the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]], at the end of the first age of the [[Chaining of Melkor]]. She was born in the [[Forest of Neldoreth]] under the [[stars]], and [[niphredil]] first grew at the moment of her birth.<ref>{{GA|17}}</ref>

She would often [[Ir Ithil ammen Eruchín|sing]]<ref>{{LB|Song}}, lines 99-103</ref> and dance in the woods, while her friend [[Daeron]], the minstrel of Thingol, would play his flute. Daeron came to love her, and while she enjoyed his company, she did not return his love.<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Quest for the Silmaril===
{{Main|Quest for the Silmaril}}
During such an occasion she was discovered by [[Beren]] as he wandered the woods of her father's kingdom, and instantly fell in love with her.  Daeron chirped out a warning, and she hid.  While he searched for her, he accidentally laid his hand on her arm.  He caught her alone some months later, and they grew to love one another. When Lúthien took Beren before her father, he was appalled that his royal daughter should wish to wed a mortal, and as is recounted in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' so set Beren what he thought was an unachievable task, to recover a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of [[Morgoth]] himself. So Beren left Doriath in pursuit of his hopeless quest.
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Encounter of Beren and Luthien.jpg|left|thumb|''Encounter of Beren and Luthien'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
After a time, a darkness fell on Lúthien's heart, and she learned from her mother Melian what this meant; Beren had been captured by [[Sauron]], and was held in the dungeons of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Though Thingol sought to stop her, Lúthien set out from Doriath to rescue Beren, if she could. Passing through many adventures, she gained the help of [[Huan the Hound]], and together they came to [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth|Sauron's Isle]]. She nearly fell to the force of Sauron's hatred alone, but through her magic and Huan's strength they defeated Sauron and rescued Beren. Eventually Beren set out for [[Angband]] once again, but this time Lúthien accompanied him.

[[File:Alan Lee - fluttering before his eyes, she wound a mazy-wingéd dance.jpg|thumb|''Fluttering before his eyes, she wound a mazy-wingéd dance'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Through Lúthien's powers, they passed the gates of Angband, and the great wolf [[Carcharoth]] that guarded them. Coming before the Dark Throne itself, Morgoth prepared to have both of them captured and killed, but Lúthien wove a spell and conducted a dance that put even Morgoth and his court into a deep sleep, and Beren cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown. Returning to the gates, they found that Carcharoth barred their escape. Lúthien had been drained of her strength after putting the slumber over Angband and could not fight against the werewolf. Beren held up the hallowed jewel to protect them, but the monstrous wolf bit off his hand and, with it, consumed the Silmaril. But the Silmarils were blessed by [[Varda]] herself, so that any unclean flesh that touched them would be withered and burnt. The wolf's innards were consumed with that burning, and it ran howling into the south. Before the servants of Morgoth awakening beneath the mountains could pursue them, three [[Great Eagles]] came to the aid of Beren and Lúthien, bearing them away from [[Thangorodrim]].

Lúthien healed Beren, and they came at last back to her father's halls at [[Menegroth]]. There they heard tidings that the maddened wolf had entered Thingol's realm, and Beren set out with the King to the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. After nightfall they returned; the wolf was slain and the Silmaril recovered, but Beren and Huan both were wounded mortally. Both passed away shortly after returning, and soon after Lúthien too wasted of grief.<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Aftermath and death===
[[File:Tuuliky - The Death.jpg|thumb|left|''The Death'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]
Their spirits were gathered in the [[Halls of Mandos]] in the [[Uttermost West]], and there Lúthien sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of [[Mandos]] himself. So she was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to [[Middle-earth]] with Beren, where they dwelt for a time in happiness on the green island of [[Tol Galen]] in the River [[Adurant]].<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref> The lands surrounding the isle were later known as [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]], ""Land of the Dead that Live"".<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

After the destruction of [[Doriath]] Beren participated in battle for the last time. He ambushed the routed [[dwarves]], and in the process also acquired the Silmaril he once took from Morgoth's crown. He brought the Silmaril, which was inside the [[Nauglamir]], to Lúthien, and she wore it until the day she and Beren died of old age. It is said that their deaths came quicker than expected because of the Silmaril, for the flame of the beauty of Lúthien as she wore the jewel was too bright for mortal lands.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 348</ref> After their death, the Silmaril was passed to their son [[Dior]], which caused the [[Second Kinslaying]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>

===Final death===
Among the Children of [[Ilúvatar]] the final death of Beren and Lúthien is accounted in {{FA|503}} for in that year's autumn Dior received the Silmaril in Doriath, and it was taken as a sign of his parents' death.<ref name=""TL351"">{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351. Cf. ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Ruin of Doriath]]""</ref> In truth the date of their death is unknown, for none saw them leave the world or marked where their bodies lay.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 305-306</ref>

==Etymology==
''Lúthien'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning ""Daughter of Flowers"". The first element in the name is ''[[lúth]]'' (""blossom, inflorescence"").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 15</ref> The second element is the feminine suffix ''[[-ien]]'' (""daughter"").

In early writings, [[Doriathrin]] ''Luthien'' and [[Noldorin]] ''Lhūthien'' meant ""enchantress"", deriving from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''luktiēnē'' (""enchantress""; from [[Sundocarme|root]] ''LUK'' ""magic, enhantement"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""LUK""</ref>

''[[Tinúviel]]'' (from Primitive Quendian ''tindōmiselde'') means ""Nightingale"", or, more literally, ""Daughter of Twilight"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""SEL-D""</ref><ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 73</ref>

==Inspiration==
Lúthien was largely inspired from [[Edith Bratt]] and when she died, Tolkien asked his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] to include ''Lúthien'' in her gravestone, as he considered her ""my Lúthien.""<ref>{{L|340}}, p. 420</ref> 

{{blockquote|I never called Edith 'Lúthien' – but she was the source of the story that in time became  the chief pan of the Silmarillion. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in [[1917]], and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing – and  dance. But the story has gone crooked, & I am left, and I cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos.|[[Letter 340]]}}

The tale also shares the common element of folktales with the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task for the suitor, which is then fulfilled. The Welsh tale of [[Wikipedia:Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch and Olwen]] is one such story. 

The travel of Lúthien to Mandos and softening Námo with her song, in order to release her beloved, is a usual theme in mythology and religion: the Greek tale (as told by Ovid) of [[Wikipedia:Orpheus and Eurydice|Orpheus and Eurydice]] (see also the poem ''[[Sir Orpheo]]'', a medieval retale), the Japanese myth of [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi and Izanami]], the Akkadian version of the Sumerian myth of [[Wikipedia:Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's descent to the Underworld]], the Mayan myth of Ix Chel and Itzamna or the Indian legend of [[Wikipedia:Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri and Satyavan]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[File:Alan Lee - Tevildo and Tinúviel.jpg|thumb|''Tevildo and Tinúviel'' by [[Alan Lee]].]]
When the story of her love with Beren first appeared in the ''[[Lost Tales]]'', ''Tinúviel'' was her birth name and [[Daeron|Dairon]] was her brother.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, p. 41</ref> The idea that the name ''Tinúviel'' was given to her by Beren emerged in the early ''[[Lays of Beleriand]]'', along with her birth name ''Lúthien'' (although at first Tolkien tentatively gave her the birth name of ''[[Melilot Brandybuck#Other versions of the legendarium|Melilot]]'').<ref>{{LB|3}}, pp. 159, 179-180</ref>

In a crossed out note, her brother was [[Tinfang Warble|Timpinen]] and the two ""returned to the Eldar"" while their father never did.<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}, note 1</ref>

In some of the earlier writings, the story of Beren and Tinúviel was slightly different. Instead of encountering Sauron on Tol Sirion, Tinúviel rescued her lover from the hands of [[Tevildo]], Prince of Cats. [[Tevildo]], however, was written out of the plot, and replaced with Sauron.<ref>{{BL|Noldorinwa}}, pp. 57-68</ref>

Before this name was assigned to the elf-maid, the name ''Lúthien'' was connected with ''[[Luthany]]'', the Elfin name for England.<ref name=""Aelfwine"">{{LT2|VI}}</ref>{{rp|313}} In several very early drafts of unfinished stories, ''Lúthien'' was the Elfin name of [[Ælfwine]], translated first as ""wanderer"" and later as ""friend"".<ref name=""Aelfwine"" />{{rp|301–304}}

{{quote|What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Goodbye!|[[Bilbo Baggins]]}}

'''Nar''' was one of the [[Dwarves]] that helped [[Bilbo Baggins]] on the preparations for his [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|big birthday feast]].

== History ==
Bilbo had ordered presents from [[Erebor]] and [[Dale]],<ref group=note>As such, Nar and his companions are probably [[Dwarves of Erebor]].</ref> and in [[September]] dwarves with long beards and deep hoods driving a wagon came to [[Hobbiton]]. Some of them, stayed in [[Bag End]] for the following days doing preparations.

After Bilbo's disappearance trick, he returned invisible to Bag End while dwarves were doing work in various rooms, packing and labelling Bilbo's farewell presents. Bilbo took his stuff and had a quarrel with Gandalf about leaving [[One Ring|his magic ring]] behind. After the dialogue, Bilbo whistled and Nar, [[Anar (dwarf)|Anar]] and [[Hannar]], came and said that everything was ready and labelled. Then they took off.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
The names of Nar, Anar and Hannar appear in the early writings of the chapter ""[[A Long-expected Party]]"", where Nar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose their names in the published book nor gave him any dialogue; the name [[Nár]] was given to a different dwarf in the final work. 

In that early text also, except the three dwarves who accompanied Bilbo, there was a fourth dwarf, [[Lofar]], who stayed behind, but there is no trace or mention of him in the published book.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Nár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means ""Corpse"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Náin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2665|n}} - {{TA|2799|n}}, lived 134 years) was the son of [[Grór]], the [[Lord of the Iron Hills]].

== History ==
Considering its length, Náin more than likely fought in much of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], however his only deeds are recorded at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]]. 

In the battle, Náin led fresh reinforcements to the [[Dimrill Dale]] where he fought his way all the way up to the steps of the [[East-gate]] of [[Moria]], where he dueled with [[Azog]]. But Náin was half blind with rage and fatigued from battle, so he swung with all his might at the Orc. Azog darted aside and kicked Náin's leg so that he missed and shattered his mattock on the steps. Náin stumbled and Azog tried to hew his neck, but the Dwarf's mail withstood the edge. Yet, the blow was so powerful that Náin's neck was broken and he fell.  

After the battle his body was burned, along with the rest of the [[Burned Dwarves|dead]] on wooden pyres. After his death the lines of Grór's two elder brothers failed, and Náin's son [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] became King.<ref name=""Durin's Folk""/>

'''Náin II''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2338|n}} - {{TA|2585|n}}, died age 247) was the King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 97 years, succeeding his father [[Óin (King of Durin's Folk)|Óin]] upon his death in {{TA|2488}}, being the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name=""AppA"">{{App|A3}}</ref> 

==History==
Náin became King of the [[Dwarves]] of Durin shortly after the end of the [[Watchful Peace]], when [[Sauron]] returned to [[Mirkwood]] from out of the East.  The majority of Durin's Folk at this time dwelt in the [[Grey Mountains]], which had been their home since [[Thorin I]] had moved there from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in order to mine their riches. During his time, [[Orcs]] increased in the [[Misty Mountains]], and the [[Éothéod]] removed from their northern lands adjacent to the Grey Mountains to settle in [[Calenardhon]]. Towards the end of Náin's reign, [[dragons]] from the [[Forodwaith (lands)|wastes to the north]] began to come south and make [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war on the Dwarves]].

Nain was the ancestor of seven of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company]] ([[Thorin]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Óin]], and [[Glóin]]) and [[Gimli]] [[Elf-friend]] of the [[Company of the Ring]].

==Etymology==
''Náinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Corpselike"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Nár''' was an old [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], the sole companion of King [[Thrór]] when he set out to wander in the wilds of [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Almost nothing is known of Nár, other than that he accompanied Thrór, the [[King of Durin's folk]] on his final journey in his attempt to find fortune in wider world and escape the scorn of Men. They travelled together from [[Dunland]], where Thrór's relatives and subjects were living at the time, heading north they crossed the [[Redhorn Pass]] and came down into [[Azanulbizar]].<ref name=Durin>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Their journey eventually brought them to the  ancient halls of [[Moria]], now infested with [[Orcs]] and [[Trolls]]. Nár begged Thrór to beware, but he took no heed and insisted on entering while Nár stayed behind and waited for the king not far from the gate. 

[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Azog and Nár'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]
That was the last any Dwarf ever saw of Thrór alive for he was beheaded by the Orcs, and their chieftain [[Azog]] branded his own name on Thrór's brow in [[Cirth|dwarf-runes]]. The Orcs allowed Nár to live only so that he could return to Thrór's son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] with a message that Azog now ruled in Moria and if any Dwarves dare enter there again, they will share the same fate. Azog threw towards him a pouch of few [[money|coins]] for his services as a messenger.

Nár fled back down the [[Silverlode]] to Dunland where his message caused such anger amongst his people that it raised a call to arms among all seven Dwarf Houses to avenge the elder high-king of their race, leading the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. 
In the climactic [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], Azog himself was slain along with thousands of others on both sides.<ref name=Durin/>

==Etymology==
''Nár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means ""Corpse"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Nár.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nár in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Nár, now an elderly dwarf with bad eyesight and even worse memory, is living in Zudrugund, a settlement of [[Longbeard]] exiles from [[Erebor]] in [[Dunland]] that was abandoned when [[Thorin Oakenshield]] led his people to [[Ered Luin]]. Nár stayed behind and his elder years is now being looked after by Frithgeir, the only other dwarf in these lands.
:When the player is imprisoned in [[Orthanc]], Saruman taunts them that he had observed their movements for a long time and claims to have killed Nár after his usefulness came to an end. After escaping the captivity, the player checks back on Nár and Frithgeir and discovers that Saruman had lied. After the [[Siege of Erebor]], the new King [[Thorin III Stonehelm]] learns from the player that Nár is still alive and invites the old friend to live the rest of his days in peace under the halls of the [[Lonely Mountain]].

'''Rog''' was the [[Gnome]]-lord of the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath|people of the Hammer of Wrath]] in Gondolin according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
Rog was a blacksmith, and chief of the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath|folk of the Hammer of Wrath]]. He was considered the strongest of the [[Noldoli]], and was like considered third greatest in valour.<ref name=""LT2"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|174}}

{{Quote|Who now shall fear the Balrogs for all their terror? See before us the accursed ones who for ages have tormented the children of the Noldoli, and who now set a fire at our backs with their shooting. Come ye of the Hammer of Wrath and we will smite them for their evil.|[[Rog]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]""}}

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], he led his people against the attack of [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]] in the northern gate. When the gate was broken, he stirred his kindred against the Balrogs with words of passion, and though many were slain, they slew a number of the fiery creatures ""that... was a marvel and dread to the hosts of [[Melko]], for ere that day never had any Balrogs been slain by the hand of Elves or Men"". Seeing that they had no way back, Rog rushed his men outside the city, where the folk of the Hammer were hemmed in, and every one of them perished, including him.<ref name=""LT2""/>{{rp|178–9}}

== Etymology ==
The name ''Rog'', in earlier writings ''Rôg'', seems curious as a name for an elf-lord of Gondolin: no other one-syllable names appear in other writings.

The meaning or etymology of the name is unclear, and in the context of the later works it would mean ""Demon"" (cf. ''[[raug]]''), in [[Sindarin]], as an element in ''[[Balrog]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""[[RUK]]""</ref><ref>{{WJ|P4}}, p. 415</ref> But the early ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' gives an adjective: ''rôg'', ''rog'' (""doughty, strong""), related with ''arog'' (""swift, rushing"") and ''raug'' of the same meaning.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry ""Rog""</ref> The [[Qenya]] form of his name was ''Rōka''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Rog's death ""without the walls"" is mentioned in the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'',<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}, p. 144</ref> which was the main text used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for his edition of the chapter ""[[Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin]]"" within ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. However, Christopher removed the mention of this character, explaining that his father would likely not have used that out of phase name.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 211, footnote</ref>

'''Rose ""Rosie"" Gamgee''' (née '''Cotton''') ({{TA|2984}}<ref name=""GamFam""/> - [[Mid-year's Day]] {{FoA|61}}<ref name=""Later"">{{App|Later}}</ref>) was the daughter of [[Tolman Cotton Senior]] and [[Lily Brown]]. She married [[Samwise Gamgee]] at the end of the [[Third Age]], and bore him a record thirteen children.

==Life==
===Youth===
Rose Cotton was born in the year {{SR|1384|n}} by [[Shire Reckoning]], the second child and first daughter of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Tolman Cotton]] and [[Lily Brown]].<ref name=""GamFam"">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> The Cotton family lived in a farm on the [[South Lane]], which was fairly close to [[Bywater]].<ref name=""HandS612"">{{HM|UI}}, p. 612</ref> Not much of her youth is known, except that she and her brothers - [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom]], [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Bowman Cotton|Nick]] and [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]] - frequently swam in the [[Bywater Pool]] with the children of the Gamgee family, to which the Cottons were close.<ref name=""MtDoom"">{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
Rosie was still fond of Sam when both grew to adulthood, and when he announced he'd be going with [[Frodo Baggins]] to [[Crickhollow]], she did not like it.<ref name=""Grey"">{{RK|VI9}}</ref> Even though everyone had given up hope of seeing Sam - or any of the other [[Travellers|Hobbits]] - back, she waited patiently. Since the Spring of {{TA|3019}}, she had expected Sam to return. 
 
At the time, [[Ruffians|Ruffian]] rule over the Shire had lasted some three months, having started earlier that year.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> Old Tom Cotton had been itching to get his hands on them, but he refrained from doing so as he had his wife and Rosie to look after. Rosie was relieved to find Sam on the doorstep on [[2 November|November 2]]. 

Rosie and her mother tended to Sam, Frodo and several others that night, as they prepared to [[Battle of Bywater|drive out the Ruffians]]. With shining eyes and a smile on her face she heard Frodo tell of Sam's adventure and fame abroad.<ref name=""Scouring"">{{RK|VI8}}</ref> Sam and Frodo lived with the Cottons until [[Bagshot Row]] and [[Bag End]] were restored, the following Spring. Sam later joined Frodo in Bag End, but was torn in two - he wanted to stay loyal to Frodo, as well as marry Rosie.<ref name=""Grey""/> 

Frodo solved this problem by telling Sam that he and Rosie would both be welcome to live with him at Bag End after the wedding. Sam and Rosie married on [[1 May|May 1]], {{TA|3020}},<ref name=""Chief"">{{App|Chief}}</ref> and moved into Bag End.<ref name=""Grey""/> There, they lived happily, and begot [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]], their first daughter, who was born on the [[25 March|anniversary of the Downfall of Sauron]].<ref name=""Chief""/>

===Fourth Age===
The Fourth Age started with one child, but many more would follow. Rose bore a record thirteen children, beating [[Adamanta Chubb]], the wife of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], by one.<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]] was born in {{FoA|2}}, [[Rose Gardner|Rose-lass]] in {{FoA|4}}, [[Merry Gardner|Merry]] in {{FoA|6}}, [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]] in {{FoA|8}}, [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]] in {{FoA|10}},  [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]] in {{FoA|11}}, [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]] in {{FoA|12}}, [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]] in {{FoA|14}}, [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]] in {{FoA|15}}, [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]] in {{FoA|17}}, [[Robin Gardner|Robin]] in {{FoA|19}}, and their last child, [[Tolman Gardner|Tom]], in {{FoA|21}}.<ref name=""GamFam""/>

That year, {{FoA|21|n}}, marked the only major undertaking of Mistress Rose. She and Sam travelled to [[Gondor]], and stayed with [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for well over a year. In the meantime, Rose's brother [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom]] took over Sam's tasks as [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]]. After their return, Rose would continue to live by her husband's side, until her passing at the age of 98 at [[Mid-year's Day]] of {{FoA|61}}.<ref name=""Later""/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Rose'' is a translation of an unknown [[Westron]] name. She is, like many female Hobbits, named after a flower,<ref name=""OnTrans"">{{App|Translation}}</ref> the [[Roses|rose]]. The surname '''Cotton''' comes from a Westron ''Hlothran'', which roughly translates as ""Cottager"".<ref name=""OnTrans""/>

In the ''[[King's Letter]]'', which was not included in ''The Return of the King'' as published, [[Aragorn|Elessar]] translated the name Rose as '''''[[Meril]]''''' in [[Sindarin]].<ref name=""TheEp"">{{SD|XI}}</ref> In his linguistical analysis of the ''King's Letter'', [[Carl F. Hostetter]] noted the resemblance to [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], the queen of [[Tol Eressëa]] in the earliest stages of the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], ''The ""King's Letter"": An Historical and Comparative Analysis'', in [[Vinyar Tengwar 31|''Vinyar Tengwar'', Number 31]] (September [[1993]]), pp. 12-34</ref> Hostetter could not connect it to any entry in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', which mirrors [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s observations on Meril-i-Turinqi, for which no root could be found in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]''<ref name=""BoLTApp"">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Meril-i-Turinqi""</ref> - however, a [[Gnomish]] translation was translated as ""Queen of Flowers"".<ref name=""BoLTApp""/> As the [[Tur|second element]] represents the ""queen"" part, ''Meril'' appears to be one of the oldest words for ""Flower"" in the ''[[legendarium]]''.

Perhaps it's not unintentional that a Hobbit woman with a jewel-name married into the Baggins family, recently made rich by Bilbo's travels. Both Ruby's marriage and name are consistent with the Bolgers' being of a higher class.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, p.198</ref>

'''Thorin I''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2035|n}} – {{TA|2289|n}}, died aged 254) was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] of [[Durin's Folk]] for 99 years, succeeding his father, [[Thráin I]], on his death in {{TA|2190}}. Thorin was the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] being the great-grandson of [[Durin VI]].<ref name=""AppA"">{{App|A3}}</ref>

==History==
Thorin was born after his father Thráin had led the [[Dwarves of Moria]] away from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and had founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Thorin himself became [[King under the Mountain]] in {{TA|2190}}. However, he heard that the majority of the remnants of [[Durin's Folk]] were now gathering in the [[Grey Mountains]]. In {{TA|2210}} he decided to leave the Lonely Mountain and reunited its people with [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|their brethren]] in the Grey Mountains, which were rich and largely unexplored.

Thorin I died in {{TA|2289|n}}, at the age of 254, and was succeeded by his son [[Glóin (King of Durin's Folk)|Glóin]]. His sixth great-grandson, [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]], was the much famed leader of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which reclaimed the Lonely Mountain from the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].<ref name=""AppA""/><ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Bold"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Thorin II''', also known as '''Thorin Oakenshield''', was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] from {{TA|2850}} until his death in {{TA|2941}}, being the son of [[Thráin|Thráin II]], grandson of [[Thrór]] and older brother to [[Frerin]] and [[Dís]]. Thorin led [[Durin's Folk]] of the [[Blue Mountains]] during their time in exile. In {{TA|2941}} he led the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] accompanied by twelve [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins]], and [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]; he briefly became [[King under the Mountain]] until he perished following the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}; {{H|10}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>

==History==
===Youth and exile===
Thorin was born in {{TA|2746}}, presumably in the Lonely Mountain where his grandfather, [[Thrór]], was King under the Mountain. Thorin was still a youngster (aged c. 24), by Dwarves' reckoning, when the dragon [[Smaug]] descended upon the mountain of Erebor in flames. Smaug left the mannish town of [[Dale]] in ruins and killed many dwarves who were inside the mountain. Thrór and Thráin (Thorin's father) escaped using a secret [[Back Door]]. Meanwhile Thorin was one of the few Dwarves who were not inside the mountain at the time. Thus the surviving [[Dwarves of Erebor]] were driven into exile and Thrór, Thráin, and Thorin fled south and ended up to [[Dunland]].<ref name=""AppA3"" /><ref name=""H1"" />

===War of the Dwarves and Orcs===
Disillusioned, Thorin's grandfather Thrór wandered to the [[Great Gates|Eastern gate]] of [[Moria]], the old mansion of the [[Longbeards]], now infested by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs]]. He entered it and ended up murdered and desecrated by the Orc [[Azog]]. These news were brought by his companion [[Nár]] to Thráin, thus the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] began.<ref name=""AppA3"" />
[[File:Mikel Janin - Battle of Azanulbizar.jpeg|left|thumb|''Battle of Azanulbizar'' by [[:Category:Images by Mikel Janin|Mikel Janin]]]]
The war was fought long and hard between the two races, ultimately ending in a pyrrhic Dwarven victory at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799}}. Both Thráin and Thorin were wounded during this battle and [[Frerin]] (Thorin's brother) was killed. When his shield broke, he cut a bough from an oak tree to block the blows of his foes.<ref>{{App|A3}}, note 46.</ref> Despite victory no Dwarf dared to re-enter [[Moria]] out of fear of [[Durin's Bane]].<ref name=""App|A3"">{{App|A3}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>

In memory of this, Thorin swore to always bear a plain shield of oak with no device until he should be hailed king,<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref> and thus he earned the epithet '''Oakenshield'''.

===Return into exile===
[[File:Charles Burggraf - We will get it back.jpg|thumb|right|left|''""We will get it back""'' by [[:Category:Images by Charles Burggraf|Charles Burggraf]]]]
Thráin, Thorin, and the other survivors of [[Durin's Folk]] left Azanulbizar and returned to [[Dunland]]. However they soon began to wander [[Eriador]] before settling at last in the [[Blue Mountains]]. Here they prospered in their own fashion, forging iron objects and increasing their numbers (albeit, due to a scarceness of [[Dwarf-women]], very slowly, and by wandering Longbeards who heard of his dwelling). Nonetheless they all still longed to return to the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=""AppA3"" />

By this time Thráin was in possession of [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] of power. It is possible that as [[Sauron]]'s power grew so too did the ring's influence over Thráin. His burning desire for gold and to return to the Lonely Mountain became too great and in {{TA|2841}} he set out to return. Thorin, then aged ninety-five, was never to see his father again, as Sauron captured and imprisoned Thráin in [[Dol Guldur]]. Thus it was that around Thráin 's disappearance and death ({{TA|2850}}) Thorin became the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]. Thorin and his people were content living in the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Eriador]] but as the years waned Thorin's desire to return to Erebor grew.<ref name=""App|A3"" />

===Quest for Erebor===
<!--Insert basic storyline of The Hobbit-->
====A new hope====
{{quote|Listen to me, Thorin Oakenshield! [...] If this hobbit goes with you, you will succeed. If not, you will fail. A foresight is on me, and I am warning you.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name=""UT9"">{{UT|9}}</ref>}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf and Thorin.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf and Thorin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The fortunes of the House of Durin changed when Thorin met [[Gandalf]] by chance in {{TA|2941}}.<ref group=""note"">Different accounts dispute the exact location of this first meeting. One source states that it occurred at an Inn in [[Bree]]. Whilst another states that Thorin started talking to Gandalf when he overtook him on the road.</ref> They then proceeded to go to [[Thorin's Halls]]. There they discussed their tales and Gandalf formulated a plan. Gandalf knew that Sauron could have potentially used Smaug with devastating effect. Therefore both he and Thorin had a shared interest in removing Smaug. Gandalf wanted Thorin and a company of dwarves to travel to the Lonely Mountain taking [[Bilbo Baggins]] with them. Gandalf's instinct was that the [[Quest of Erebor]] would only be successful if Bilbo accompanied them.

Therefore Gandalf invited Thorin and other Dwarves to [[Hobbiton]] of [[the Shire]], instructing them to look for a [[Smials|smial]] whose door was marked with the sign of the thief (as the dwarves had gotten it into their head that Bilbo was a thief). Thus Thorin found himself in [[Bag End]], where they perused the hobbit's hospitality. However, Thorin and the dwarves were not convinced; it was not until Gandalf revealed [[Thrór's Map]] and key that Thorin was convinced that the quest would be profitable to him. Even after the ""[[An Unexpected Party|Unexpected Party]]"" Gandalf only persuaded Thorin to take Bilbo on the morning that they set off.<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}</ref>

Thus it was that in {{TA|2941}} Thorin set off for the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]], [[Glóin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur]]. A short time into the journey the adventurers found a Troll's cave. Here they found a hoard of treasure which included blades made in the ancient city of [[Gondolin]]. Bilbo found a knife that he named [[Sting]], Gandalf acquired [[Glamdring]] and meanwhile Thorin found [[Orcrist]].<ref name=""H2"" /> Whilst [[Thorin and Company]] were in [[Rivendell]] [[Elrond]] read the inscriptions on the blades and informed them of their sword's histories. He also read the [[moon-letters]] on Thrór's map; it read ""''stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks [...] and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the keyhole.''""<ref>{{H|3}}</ref>

====Return of the King under the Mountain====
[[File:David T. Wenzel - Thorin in Esgaroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Thorin in Esgaroth'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]
Upon reaching [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], the closest settlement to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin was greeted warmly and the men of Lake-town hailed the return of the [[King under the Mountain]].<ref name=""H10"">{{H|10}}</ref> They soon reached the Lonely Mountain itself and ""''with the last light of Durin's Day''"" they found the secret side-door, using the key to open it.<ref>{{H|11}}</ref> Thorin sent Bilbo in to carry out his duty as their 'esteemed burglar'. This enraged Smaug who sought to destroy the burglar and take out his vengeance on the [[Lake-men]].<ref>{{H|12}}</ref> The dragon was slain by [[Bard]] who pierced an un-armoured spot on the dragon's underside <ref>{{H|14}}</ref> with a [[Black Arrow]].

Upon hearing the news of the death of Smaug, Thorin fortified the main entrance to the mountain. Hosts of [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and Lake-men approached the mountain led by the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] and Bard respectively. Thorin refused to consider Bard's claim to a share in the treasure until the Elven-host had withdrawn. Refusing to send away the Elves, Bard pronounced the mountain under siege until Thorin would give them their part of the treasure. Then Thorin sent for his cousin, [[Dáin Ironfoot]], who brought more than five-hundred Dwarves from the [[Iron Hills]].<ref>{{H|15}}; {{H|16}}</ref> Bilbo sought to bring an end to the dispute; to this end he secretly gave the [[Arkenstone]] to Bard and the Elvenking to use in making a deal with Thorin. When Thorin heard about Bilbo's actions he was furious and cast him out of the company.<ref>{{H|17}}</ref>

====Death====
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Death of Thorin Oakenshield.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Thorin Oakenshield'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]
However, all disputes were cast aside when the army of [[Bolg]], Azog's son, suddenly attacked. Thus the three armies of [[Elves]], [[Men]], and [[Dwarves]] united against the two armies of [[Orcs|Goblins]] and [[Wargs]]: the [[Battle of Five Armies]] had begun. As the battle drew on, Thorin leapt from the front gate and rallied all Elves, Men, and Dwarves to him. The armies of the [[free peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]] emerged triumphant. Nonetheless [[Kíli]] and [[Fíli]] were killed and Thorin was gravely wounded. On his deathbed Thorin apologised to Bilbo for his angry words and deeds. He commended his good character, courage and friendship, saying that ''""if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.""'' With that, he died. He was laid to rest deep within the Lonely Mountain. [[Bard]] of [[Dale]] placed the Arkenstone upon Thorin's chest, whilst the Elvenking laid Orcrist upon Thorin's tomb.<ref>{{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
{{quote|It was Thorin, but you could only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', ""[[Barrels Out of Bond]]""}}

Thorin had a white beard<ref name=""History"">{{HH|7iv}}</ref> and wore a sky-blue hood with a long silver tassel. Around his neck he wore a golden chain, upon which he attached his grandfather's key.<ref name=""H1"" /> He wore a belt of gold and jewels,<ref name=""History"" /> and his stockings were yellow. He was also said to be quite tall for a dwarf, though his height was otherwise negligible compared to other races.<ref name=""H2"">{{H|2}}</ref>

===Personality===
{{quote|Thorin did not live to enjoy his triumph or his treasure. Pride and greed overcame him in spite of my warning.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name=""UT9""/>}}

Thorin was capable of being stubborn, proud, and greedy. According to Gandalf he was, from the beginning, contemptuous about the notion that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] should go with him on his long-desired adventure to the Lonely Mountain; he thought that Gandalf was trying to mock him and make him look foolish. Indeed, Thorin found it difficult to accept the advice of Gandalf at all, believing that he should have been drawing plans for war and battle rather than planning to use a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] as a burglar. He gradually came to respect the Hobbit's value to his quest as Bilbo again and again proved his stealth and courage. Thorin's most coveted prize was the [[Arkenstone]], something which Bilbo believed was not only the heart of the mountain but the heart of Thorin also.<ref>{{UT|9}}; {{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>

Another one of his distinctive characteristics was that on important occasions he had the habit of going on ""without telling any one there anything that was not known already"".<ref name=""H1"" /> Once he referred to Fíli and Kíli as ""sons of my father's daughter"" rather than ""nephews"" or ""sister-sons"", for instance.<ref name=""H10"" />

===Weapons===
Thorin was a formidable swordsman, archer, and skilled military leader, capable of rallying Men, Elves and Dwarves to his side in the Battle of the Five Armies. He was the owner of the elven blade known as Orcrist, The Goblin Cleaver, a legendary sword from Gondolin that was said to have slain hundreds of goblins. When orcs or goblins were nearby, it glowed blue. He used this blade throughout the entire Quest of Erebor, but was taken from him during his capture in Mirkwood. It was then later laid on his tomb, after his death to warn Erebor of any oncoming dark forces that would dare try to take over the Mountain 

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Bold"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The epithet ""[[Oakenshield]]"" also comes from the ''Dvergatal''. ''Eikinskjaldi'' means ""Oakenshield"", and it has long been considered the name of a Dwarf. However, because the name appears twice, both in Dúrinn's and Dválinn's line, it has also been suggested that it simply means ""with an oaken shield"".<ref>P.H. Salus, Taylor Beekman, ""[http://pao.chadwyck.co.uk.proxy-ub.rug.nl/articles/displayItemPage.do?FormatType=fulltextimages&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=12E4F77F8FAA34BB2&ItemNumber=9&PageNumber=1 'Eikinskjaldi, Fjalarr', and 'Eggþer': Notes on Dwarves and Giants in the 'Völuspá'""], published in ''[[wikipedia:Neophilologus|Neophilologus]]'' Vol 53 (1969), Issue #1, pp. 76-81</ref>

==Inspiration==
Like many [[Dwarvish]] names, both Þorinn and Eikinskjaldi appear in the [[Norse]] poem [[Völuspá]], but there they are the names of two individual dwarves.<ref>{{HH|A3}}</ref>
	
[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that Tolkien may possibly have been inspired by a [[Wikipedia:Kvæði|Faroese ballad]], ""[[Wikipedia:Regin|Regin]] Smiður"", in which [[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] uses an oak tree branch as a weapon:<ref>{{webcite|author=Various|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?33053-Influence-of-the-Sigurd-legend-on-parts-of-The-Hobbit|articlename=Influence of the Sigurd legend on parts of ''The Hobbit''?|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=14 March 2013}}</ref>

{{blockquote|All from an ancient oaken-tree<br>A mighty branch he tore, <br>and lammed those lads so lustily<br>That some rose up no more|E.M. Smith-Dampier (1934), ''Sigurd The Dragon-Slayer, A Faroese Ballad Cycle''}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name ''[[Gandalf]]'' was used by Tolkien for the character who later would be named ""Thorin Oakenshield"" in the published works.<ref>{{HH|Intro}}</ref>

The statement that Thráin II and his son Thorin settle in the South of Ered Luin beyond the Shire in the year 2802 was added to the entry for the year 2799 of the Third Age in Appendix B in the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 715</ref>.

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Thorin's voice is provided by [[Hans Conried]]. Rather than remaining within Erebor until the Battle of Five Armies is nearly lost, he marched out with his companions to join the Dwarves of the Iron Hills in facing the allied armies of Mirkwood and Laketown. Upon witnessing the approach of the Goblin-Wolf army, Thorin abruptly addresses the elf king in friendly terms. The two then join forces with Bard and fight throughout the ensuing battle.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Thorin was portrayed by [[Richard Armitage]].<ref name=""PJCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> Unlike many other adaptations where Thorin is depicted as white-haired, Thorin is portrayed as younger looking (in the original book he was the oldest of the [[Dwarves]] in the [[Thorin and Company|Company]]; in the movies he appears to be roughly in the middle of the thirteen age-wise). Thorin, however, does have streaks of gray in his black hair.

:In the prologue which flashes back to the [[Sack of Erebor]], Thorin is shown to be a natural leader, and is distressed when [[Thranduil]] and his army do not come to the Dwarves' aid. Later, during a flashback to the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] (referred to as the '''Battle of [[Moria]]''' in these films), his natural leadership is again on display, when rallying the troops after maiming [[Azog]] the Defiler ([[Dáin Ironfoot]], who killed Azog during this battle in the book, is not present at all).

:Thorin shows up later than expected at [[Bag End]]. He is thoroughly sceptical of [[Gandalf]]'s choice of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] as the fourteenth member of the Company, but the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] finally earns his approval after attempting to save him from Azog and his [[Orcs|Orc]] pack. After this ordeal, Gandalf revives him on the [[Carrock]].

:Prior to obtaining Orcrist, Thorin wields a Dwarven sword named Deathless.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Thorin is captured by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] along with all of the other Dwarves. He refuses to bargain with Thranduil on order to set them all free, still holding a grudge over the Elven-king not helping his people while [[Smaug]] destroyed their home.

:After the Dwarves are caught trying to steal weapons out of the armoury in [[Lake-town]], Thorin promises the people a share of the treasure if the Company is allowed to reclaim their kingdom. After Bilbo's audience with Smaug, he leads the Dwarves in a battle in an attempt to defeat the [[Dragons|Dragon]] by drowning him in molten gold. The plan fails, however, and Smaug instead heads off in a rage to Lake-town.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:While searching the treasure hoard inside the Mountain for the [[Arkenstone]], Thorin increasingly falls prey to Dragon sickness. He begins to be paranoid that the other Dwarves are scheming against him. He orders the other Dwarves to put up barricades to prevent anyone else from entering the Mountain, even as the [[Battle of Five Armies]] commences. He eventually overcomes his sickness and comes to his senses, leading the members of the Company into battle.

:On [[Ravenhill]], he attempts to take out the Orc army's leader, and old nemesis, Azog (with the help of [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]]). After his nephews are killed, Thorin takes on the Pale Orc one-on-one (and, in the process, gets [[Orcrist]] back from [[Legolas]]). He manages to get Azog to fall into a frozen lake, but the Orc stabs through the ice and mortally wounds him. With his last strength, Thorin plunges Orcrist into Azog's chest, finally killing him. Soon after, right before succumbing to his wounds, he makes amends with Bilbo, and dies right there on the lake.

<center>{{Quote|He was dark-haired as his mother and promised to be like her in mood also; for he was not merry and spoke little, though he learned to speak early and ever seemed older than his years. Túrin was slow to forget injustice or mockery, but his father's fire was also in him, and he could be sudden and fierce. Yet he was quick to pity, and the hurts or sadness of living things might move him to tears.|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', ""[[The Childhood of Túrin]]""}}</center>

'''Túrin Turambar''' was a tragic hero of the [[First Age]] whose life was dominated by the curse of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]]. His deeds became the tale called ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' (""The Tale of the Children of Húrin""). 

==History==
[[Image:Alan Lee - The Childhood of Túrin.jpg|thumb|left|''The Childhood of Túrin'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
===Dor Lómin===
Túrin was the only son of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] and [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]]. He had a younger sister [[Urwen]] whom everyone called ''Lalaith'', but she died in childhood from the [[Evil Breath]], the first grievous event in Túrin's life. After Húrin was captured in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (""Battle of Unnumbered Tears""), Túrin remained with his mother Morwen, who hid him from the [[Easterlings]] that [[Morgoth]] had sent to [[Hithlum]], fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him.

Túrin was friends with [[Sador]], their household servant whom he helped in his work. Sador taught him many things and carved several things for him from wood.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 41</ref>

===Doriath===
When Túrin was nine years old, Morwen sent him to [[Doriath]], away from his beloved mother and best friend, causing his heart to break for the third time since the curse was cast on him. She sent with him [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]], long-time servants, to Húrin's house. Shortly after they departed from Dor-Lómin, Túrin's second sister, [[Nienor]], was born. The road there was long and difficult, and the three travelers came close to dying of hunger and cold in the very outlying woods of their destination, but they were rescued by [[Beleg]]. In Doriath he was adopted by King [[Thingol]] as a son, being that his father Húrin was held in high honor in those lands. Thingol and Melian sent messengers inviting Túrin's mother to come to live in Doriath, which she declined, much to Túrin's grief.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Túrin begs leave of Thingol and Melian.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''Túrin begs leave of Thingol and Melian'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In Doriath, Túrin learned many skills, such as hunting, woodcraft, archery, sword fighting, and speaking [[Sindarin]]. As he grew older, however, he became restless. He began inquiring about the Men of the North, as Thingol and Morwen frequently exchanged news for Túrin's sake. Through these messages, he learned of his younger sister Nienor, although he never saw her. As Morgoth's hold on the North increased, and news from Hithlum grew scarce, Túrin sought to travel there to join the fight against the Dark Lord and find out about his kin. He asked the King's permission to join [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] in the northern marches of Doriath, fighting the [[Orcs]] of Morgoth. He wore the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]], which was sent by his mother and brought to him by Thingol's messengers, and the Orcs began to fear him more than any other.<ref name=""Doriath"">{{CH|5}}</ref>

Upon returning, Túrin accidentally caused the death of [[Saeros]], one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven, he fled,<ref name=""Doriath"" /> eventually meeting up with a band of outlaws, the [[Gaurwaith]] who dwelt south of the [[Forest of Brethil]]. There he was only known by the epithet '''''Neithan''''' (""The Wronged""). Túrin killed their leader [[Forweg]] and became their leader in his place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses of Men, and only hunted Orcs.<ref name=""Outlaws"">{{CH|6}}</ref>

===Dor-Cúarthol===
In the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave from Thingol to seek out his friend.<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 96</ref> Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at their camp, and when he could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath.<ref name=""Outlaws"" /> While they were parted, and after such a long time living in the wild, Túrin's band captured [[Mîm]] the [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarf]]. Mîm was forced to share his [[House of Ransom|halls]] on [[Amon Rûdh]] with them.<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref> 
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Strongbow and Dragonhelm.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Strongbow and Dragonhelm'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
At Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the black sword [[Anglachel]], and [[Melian]] gave him ''[[lembas]]''. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, and the area around Amon Rûdh became known as '''[[Dor-Cúarthol]]''', the ""Land of Bow and Helm"" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). Túrin took the name '''''Gorthol''''', ""The Dread Helm"". Many warriors joined them, and much of [[West Beleriand]] was freed from evil for a while.

Eventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm, and he was captured and all his men slain.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref> Beleg survived and rescued Túrin from the Orcs in [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] with the help of [[Gwindor]], an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed Beleg with Beleg's sword Anglachel. Gwindor led Túrin, dazed, to the [[Pools of Ivrin]], where he came back to his senses.<ref>{{CH|9}}</ref>

===Nargothrond===
Gwindor then led Túrin to [[Nargothrond]], where once he had lived. In Nargothrond Túrin hid his name, calling himself '''''[[Agarwaen]], son of [[Úmarth]]''''' (""Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate""). He had Anglachel reforged and named it [[Gurthang]] (""Iron of Death""). [[Finduilas]], daughter of [[Orodreth]], fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so she called him '''''Thurin''''' (""The Secret""). He was also called '''''Adanedhel''''' (""Man-Elf"") because he was so like an Elf, though he was a [[Men|Man]].<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref> 

His identity did not remain hidden for long. Gwindor revealed to [[Finduilas]] that 'Agarwaen' was in fact Túrin, and 'Úmarth' his famous father [[Húrin]]. Whether the news is reached Finduilas' father, King [[Orodreth]], Túrin was given great honor and standing. Túrin believed revealing his identity thus would also bring home Morgoth's curse. <ref group=""note"">[[Christopher Tolkien]] makes clear that this was not the case. Cf. {{CH|Introduction}}, p. 18.</ref>
[[File:Donato Giancola - Sack of Nargothrond.jpeg|thumb|200px|''Sack of Nargothrond'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]
Túrin became a chief counselor of the weak Orodreth and was highly influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the [[Elves of Nargothrond]] to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he became known as '''''Mormegil''''' (""Black Sword"").
Morgoth sent the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Glaurung]] to Nargothrond. Túrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung and stood by idly as Finduilas was dragged away, calling to him, a captive for Morgoth. Glaurung deceived him into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and Túrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and Nienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's efforts had made the way passable.

Once in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the wooden halls of the Easterling lord [[Brodda]], who had taken Húrin's kinswoman [[Aerin]] as a wife and had taken Húrin's lands and possessions. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage he killed Brodda, thereby sealing Aerin's fate. As an unintended consequence of Túrin’s problematic heroism, Aerin immolated herself alive in her halls, and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] were persecuted by the Easterlings even more cruelly than before.

Túrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the Orc's trail he came too late: the woodsmen of [[Brethil]] informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.

===Brethil===
In Brethil, Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself '''''Turambar''''' (""Master of Fate"") in the act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now finally over. One day he found a naked young woman on [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], and calling her ''[[Níniel]],'' he later took her as his wife.

Túrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil. Túrin, with two others, set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. With his black sword, he killed Glaurung at [[Cabed-en-Aras]] but was hurt and fell in a swoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last word, revealed to her she was Túrin's sister. Horrified, Níniel killed herself.

[[File:John Howe - Dragon's Curse.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dragon's Curse'' by [[John Howe]]]]
When Túrin awoke he was told by [[Brandir]], lord of the [[Haladin]] of Brethil what had happened, and he killed Brandir, refusing to believe. When he learned from [[Mablung]] of Doriath who had come to seek him that Brandir had told the truth, he killed himself on [[Gurthang]], his black sword. 

Túrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, and on his tombstone, the Haladin wrote in the [[Angerthas Daeron|Cirth of Doriath]]:

<blockquote>TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA<br>(''Túrin, Conqueror of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung'')</blockquote>

Beneath that they also wrote:

<blockquote>NIENOR NÍNIEL</blockquote>

though her body could not be found.

==Legacy==
Two years later, Morwen and Húrin came separately to Túrin's grave and met for the last time. Morwen passed away that night and Húrin buried her near their son, inscribing her epitaph on the same [[Stone of the Hapless|stone]]. The burial mound survived the [[War of Wrath]] and sinking of Beleriand to become [[Tol Morwen]], the westernmost isle off the coast of [[Lindon]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>

Túrin was a first cousin of [[Tuor]], father of [[Eärendil]]. There are many parallels between the circumstances of their lives (both lost their fathers in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, were raised in part by Elves, spent time as outlaws and as prisoners, and were war-leaders in the greatest [[Noldor]]in fortresses), but the outcome of Tuor's life was quite different. (Even Túrin's coloring was dark, enhancing his resemblance to the Noldorin Elves but further setting him apart from his fair-haired cousin.) The two never actually met, but Tuor did once see his cousin in passing on his way to Gondolin (not an everyday occurrence in the wilds of [[Beleriand]]).

There were several prophecies that Túrin would return from death. The [[Wise-woman]] [[Andreth]] of the [[Edain]] prophesied that Túrin ""in the Last Battle should return from the Dead, and before he left the [[Circles of the World]] for ever should challenge the Great Dragon of Morgoth, [[Ancalagon]] the Black, and deal him the death-stroke.""<ref name=""Rosnotes"">{{PM|Rosnotes}}, ''Note 17'', p. 374</ref><ref group=""note"">According to Christopher Tolkien, Andreth predicted the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the age in this prophecy making unclear whether it was [[Eärendil]] or Túrin who killed Ancalagon in the War of Wrath.</ref>

According to the [[Second Prophecy of Mandos]], at the end of time Morgoth will return to [[Valinor]] to wage a final battle against the Valar and Túrin will return to ""deal unto Morgoth his death and final end.""<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 333</ref> 




Whether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse, his own arrogance, or some combination of the two is debatable. Túrin is one of the few heroes of the [[Elder Days]] to have committed suicide and several of the others (such as [[Aerin]], Húrin and Nienor) are connected with his story.

==Etymology==
:''See: [[Túrin (disambiguation)]] and [[Turambar (disambiguation)]]''

In [[The Etymologies]] Túrin was given as a compound of [[Noldorin|N.]] ''tûr '''victory' and ''ind'' 'heart'.<ref name="":0"" /> The [[Quenya]] form of his name was given as ''Turindo''.<ref name="":0"">{{LR|P3}}, entry ""[[TUR]]""</ref> 

In [[Parma Eldalamberon 22|Late Notes on  Verb Structure]], written around [[1969]], Tolkien stated that the [[Quenya]] word ''turindo'' meant 'purposeful mind' or 'strong-will', and that as a name its form was ''Túrin.''<ref>{{PE|22c}}, p. 165</ref>

==Other names==
Túrin took and was given many names through his life, listed here in chronological order:

*'''Woodwose''' or '''Wildman of the Woods''', first given by Saeros as an insult, Túrin used it when questioned about his identity by the woodsmen he had rescued.<ref>{{CH|13}}, p. 194</ref>
*'''''[[Neithan]]''''', ([[S.]] ""The Wronged""), taken by Túrin when he joined the outlaws.<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 101</ref>
*'''''Gorthol''''', ([[S.]] ""The Dread Helm""), taken by Túrin when he claimed lordship of Dor-Cúarthol in reference to the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin.<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 146</ref>
*'''''Agarwaen''''', ''son of [[Úmarth]]'', ([[S.]] ""Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate""), the names Túrin gave himself and his father while in Nargothrond in an attempt to hide his identity as a child of Húrin.<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 159</ref>
*'''''Adanedhel''''', ([[S.]] ""Elf-Man""), given to him by the Elves of Nargothrond, who recognized the nobility he had acquired while in Doriath.<ref>{{CH|10}}, pp. 163-164</ref>
*'''''[[Thurin]]''''', ([[S.]] ""The Secret""), given to him by Finduilas, who doubted that his true name was ''Agarwaen''.<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 165</ref>
*'''''Mormegil''''', ([[S.]] ""Black Sword""), acquired by Túrin while he dwelt in Nargothrond, in reference to his black sword, [[Gurthang]].<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 160</ref>
*'''''Turambar''''', ([[Q.]] ""Master of Doom""), taken by Túrin when he lived among the Men of Brethil, signifying his perceived freedom from the curse of Morgoth.<ref>{{CH|13}}, p. 196</ref>
*'''''Dagnir Glaurunga''''',  ([[S.]] ""Glaurung's Bane""), given after he killed Glaurung and carved with [[Angerthas Daeron|Runes of Doriath]] on the [[Stone of the Hapless]].<ref>{{CH|18}}, p. 257</ref>
*'''''Naeramarth''''', ([[S.]] ""Evilfated""), given within Tolkien's genealogical tree of the [[Half-elven]] kinship.<ref>[[Kinship of the Half-elven]], main image</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
{{expansion}}
The broad strokes of the story of Túrin in the legendarium originates in Tolkien's attempted [[The Story of Kullervo|retelling]] of Kullervo's tale from [[Elias Lönnrot]]'s [[Kalevala]].<ref>''[[The Story of Kullervo]]''</ref>

In an early linguistic text, the [[Gnomes]] of Nargothrond gave Túrin the name '''''Gormagli''''', which is [[Noldorin]] for ""Great Bear"". Its cognate in [[Qenya]] is '''''Oromatsilë'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}</ref>{{rp|149}}

==Inspiration==
Unpublished drafts of the story, later edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published in  ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, tell the story in greater detail. These have been carefully edited together with other drafts to form ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', released in 2007.

The supposed resemblance of Túrin to figures from medieval tales can be confirmed by part of a letter Tolkien wrote to [[Milton Waldman]] concerning the publication of his works:

{{blockquote|There is the ''Children of Húrin'', the tragic tale of Túrin Turambar and his sister Níniel — of which Túrin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be '''derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, Oedipus, and the Finnish Kullervo'''.|[[Letter 131]]}}

{{blockquote|Again one may detect certain literary influences: the hero's [Túrin's] fight with a great dragon [Glaurung] inevitably suggests comparison with the deeds of '''Sigurd''' and '''Beowulf''', while his unknowing incest with his sister and his subsequent suicide were derived quite consciously from the story of '''Kullervo in the Kalevala'''.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', Part III, Chapter 1: ""Lost Tales""}}

Túrin shares several common traits with all of the characters below, like coming closer to their fate when attempting to evade it. Another significant trait is their gifted but hot tempered nature and strong will paired with their reluctance to heed wise counsels that would save them from their fate.

===Oedipus===
'''[[Wikipedia:Oedipus|Oedipus]]''' was a prince of Thebes, but his parents heard a prophecy that he would cause their demise. To evade it, they order a shepherd to kill him. However the shepherd spares the baby and gives him to a childless family. Oedipus grew ignorant of his heritage; he then heard a prophecy according to which he will kill his father and marry his mother. He left in self-exile to take himself away from his (foster) parents. 

However this brought himself closer to Thebes and his actual parents. On his way, he kills a man who unknown to him, is his actual father, the King of Thebes, fulfilling therefore part of the prophecy. Then he enters the city and after defeating the Sphinx, the people name him to replace the lost King of Thebes; furthermore, Oedipus marries the King's widow, who is in fact his mother.

Years later, while investigating the death of the former King, he realizes all the truths in his life: the King was the very man he had killed, and furthermore, he and his Queen were his parents. Oedipus blinds himself and leaves in self-exile with his two daughters/half-sisters while his mother/wife strangles herself.

===Kullervo===
{{Seealso|Kalevala#Túrin Turambar and Kullervo|l1=Túrin Turambar and Kullervo}}
In the [[Kalevala]], '''[[Wikipedia:Kullervo|Kullervo]]''''s tribe is killed by his uncle, and himself is separated by his family, something that fills him with hate and desire for revenge. As a slave, he uses magic to kill his masters and returns to his tribe; afterwards he seduces a girl, who commits suicide after discovering she is his lost sister.

Then he repeats his vows: he refuses to hear any words of reconsideration and gets a broadsword which he uses to slay the enemy tribe. On his return, he sees all his family dead. He asks the magic sword to slay him, which replies, and then he falls on it.

===Sigurd===
'''[[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]]''''s mother marries a King and Sigurd himself is fostered by a Dwarf. The Dwarf tells him about the hoard of the dragon Fafnir (who is his brother) and remakes a broken heirloom sword for him. Sigurd slays Fafnir by waiting for him in a pit, stabbing him with the sword as he passes over it. The gold he wins, however, is cursed.

===Balin===
'''[[Wikipedia:Sir Balin|Sir Balin]]''' was a knight of the King Arthur's court in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' who possessed a magic sword. By this he was unknowingly cursed to slay his own brother. Through a well-meaning act of his, he is further cursed to make the most dolorous strike ever made by man, save only the piercing of Christ's side. Later, while in King Pellam's castle, he kills Pellam's brother and maims Pellam, ruining the castle and making all the surrounding lands into a wasteland, much as Túrin slayed Brodda in his own house and how his pride brought about the destruction of Nargothrond. Eventually, he kills his brother Balan, but is mortally wounded in doing so, and outlives him by only a few hours. They were then both laid in one grave.

<center>{{Quote|Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[A Long-expected Party]]""}}</center>
'''Bilbo Baggins''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] who lived in [[The Shire]] during the final years of the [[Third Age]]. His adventure with the dwarves [[Thorin]] and [[Thorin and Company|Company]] earned him a fortune, and brought the [[One Ring]] of [[Sauron]] back into knowledge. 

==Personality==
Before his adventures, Bilbo was considered a very prim and respectable Hobbit for his polite disposition and aversion to anything out of the ordinary.  He had strict culinary and hygienic principles, being often less than thrilled with the rough conditions of travel at first.  But, being the son of [[Bungo Baggins]] and [[Belladonna Took]], Bilbo had blood from two important Hobbit families, the [[Baggins Family|Bagginses]] and the [[Took Family|Tooks]]. Because of his adventurous ""Tookish side"" (which sometimes conflicted with his stay-at-home ""Baggins side""), Baggins was rather restless and ""strange"" for a Hobbit. After his return from Erebor, he was regarded much less fondly than before by his fellow Hobbits, but paid them no mind.  Though considering himself happily retired from adventures, he often left his home for many days to meet with old friends and strangers, including [[Dwarves]]. 

Bilbo was noteworthy as the first [[Ring-bearers|ring-bearer]] in the history of [[Middle-earth]] to give up [[the One Ring]] voluntarily; he surrendered the ring to [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Gandalf]]'s request.

==History==
===Early life===
[[File:Little Bilbo in 2894.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Young Bilbo - ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'']]
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Sketch of Bilbo Baggins.png|thumb|120px|Sketch of Bilbo Baggins by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
Bilbo Baggins was born on [[September 22]] by [[Shire Reckoning]],<ref group=""note"">How the date of Bilbo's (and Frodo's) birthday corresponds with our calendar is a matter of debate. [[Appendix D]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' says that our New Year's Day (January 1) corresponds ""more or less"" to the Shire's ""January 9"", and in standard years our September 14 and the Shire's ""September 22"" both fall 256 days after that date. However, Appendix D also says that the Shire calendar's ""[[Midyear's Day]]"" is ""intended to correspond as nearly as possible to the summer solstice."" In the Shire calendar, ""September"" ([[Halimath]]) 22 is 83 days after Midyear's Day. If we take the summer solstice to be our June 21, then Bilbo's and Frodo's birthday must be 83 days later, which is our September 12.</ref> in the year {{TA|2890|n}} of the [[Third Age]], the son of [[Bungo Baggins]]  and [[Belladonna Took]]. He was a grandson of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name=""TA"" />

During his youth, Bilbo attended several parties during which he loved to listen to [[Gandalf]]'s stories<ref name=""Erebor"">{{UT|9}}</ref> about [[Dragons]], [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and princesses and was impressed by the Wizard's fireworks. Bilbo also saw the [[Fell Winter]], and was the last hobbit by the End of the Third Age to remember it. His role in the Winter is unknown. After the death of his parents, respectively in {{TA|2926}} and {{TA|2934}}, he inherited [[Bag End]]. In the eyes of his neighbours, he originally seemed just like his father, a solid, sensible, unadventurous and respectable hobbit.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|1}}</ref> But when becoming older he started to become ""strange"" and often left his home for many days to meet with strangers, including [[Dwarves]]. 

Eventually, Gandalf came to believe that Bilbo was the ideal person for an important task he had at hand, for Bilbo was both small-sized and adventurous. Gandalf came to the Shire to visit him in {{TA|2941}} but he had disappeared again because of [[Yestarë|Elven new year]].<ref name=""Erebor"" />

===Quest of Erebor===
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - An Unexpected Party.jpg|thumb|left|""An Unexpected Party"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
Gandalf managed to address him on a morning, while he sat outside his hobbit-hole. He reluctantly asked Gandalf for [[tea]] next day. Indeed Gandalf came back, bringing [[Thorin and Company|thirteen Dwarves]] with him. First came [[Dwalin]], followed by [[Balin]], next were [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]], then [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], and at last [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], [[Bombur]], [[Thorin]] and Gandalf. The Dwarves remained in Bag End for supper and afterwards [[Far over the misty mountains cold|sang a song]] about the [[Sack of Erebor]] and explained the reasons for their unannounced coming: the Dwarves were planning [[Quest of Erebor|a quest]] to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] (and its sizable hoard) from the Dragon [[Smaug]]; or, failing this, to at least recover a sizable amount of treasure from the dragon. Gandalf had volunteered Bilbo to be the company's burglar in order to accomplish these goals. Even with the Dwarves' protests and Bilbo's feeble objections, Gandalf convinced [[Thorin]] that Bilbo was the right person. Thus the Hobbit became the fourteenth member of [[Thorin and Company|the Company]] which left the Shire in {{TA|2941}}.<ref name=""Party"" /> Bilbo's initial task was to steal as much treasure from Smaug's hoard as possible, as well as recover lost family heirlooms. However, Gandalf's foreboding shows that he instinctively knew that Bilbo's presence would be essential in bringing about Smaug's death and restoring the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name=""Erebor"" />
====Across Eriador====
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Trolls (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|right|thumb|''The Trolls'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
The next day, after assembling at the [[Green Dragon]], the company's journey to the Lonely Mountain began.  Thorin and company travelled through the [[Lone-lands]] along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín and Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo to investigate.

Bilbo saw three [[Trolls]] when he approached the campfire. He tried to steal one of the Trolls' money purses but was discovered and captured by [[William]], one of the trolls. He escaped the trolls but was helpless to prevent all the dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Gandalf, however, came in the nick of time and saved them all by imitating the Trolls' voices. This led to an argument between the Trolls, who argued until dawn, when the sun turned the Trolls to stone. Upon discovery of a troll cave, Gandalf and Thorin took two fine elvish swords from the Trolls' treasure. Bilbo discovered a small elvish blade, no longer than a small knife in size.<ref>{{H|2}}</ref> He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.<ref name=""Riddles"" />

In June they came to [[Rivendell]]. During their visit Bilbo met [[Elrond]], and became enchanted with the [[Elves]]. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at [[Thrór's Map]]. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in [[Gondolin]] and were named [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that spoke of the [[Back Door|back door of Erebor]], which read:<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{H|3}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.|{{H|3}}}}

====Over the Misty Mountains====
[[File:Donato Giancola - The Hobbit - Expulsion.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Expulsion'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]
The next day the company left Rivendell<ref name=""ReferenceA"" /> and found, with Elrond's advice, the correct way over the [[Misty Mountains]], the [[High Pass]]. During a stormy night, the company took shelter in a dry cave. When everybody was sleeping, [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] appeared and took their ponies to [[Goblin-town]]. At this moment Bilbo woke up and after seeing that the ponies had disappeared, yelled. Goblins swarmed the cave and captured Bilbo and the dwarves. But thanks to Bilbo's yell, Gandalf awakened in time and avoided capture. Bilbo and the dwarves were brought before the [[Great Goblin]]. When he saw Thorin's sword, Orcrist, he was enraged and wanted to kill Thorin and his companions. But Gandalf came in time to save them and killed the Great Goblin. While escaping, Bilbo was carried by Dori. But when a goblin attacked Dori, he dropped Bilbo.<ref>{{H|4}}</ref>
[[File:Daniel Govar - Riddles in the Dark.jpg|thumb|150px|left|""Riddles in the Dark"" by [[Daniel Govar]]]]
When Bilbo's consciousness returned he picked up a strange [[The One Ring|golden ring]]. After wandering through the dark passages he came to the lake of [[Gollum]]. Gollum, desiring to eat the hobbit but not willing to face his blade, engaged in a riddle contest. If Bilbo won, according to the predetermined rules, Gollum would lead him to safety. If Gollum won, Bilbo would allow himself to be eaten. As Bilbo saw no other way to escape, he agreed with Gollum's proposal.<ref name=""Riddles"">{{H|5}}</ref>
[[File:Cor Blok - The Game of Riddles.jpg|thumb|""[[Riddle-game|The Game of Riddles]]"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
Bilbo won the contest by accident, wondering out loud as he fingered the ring he had picked up, ""What have I got in my pocket?"" Gollum mistook this for a question, and Bilbo decided to stick to it. Gollum lost, but went back to his little island to take the ring Bilbo had picked up (as it was a magic ring) to turn himself invisible and kill the hobbit anyway. But of course the ring was not there, and Gollum, enraged, suddenly guessed that Bilbo had it. He chased Bilbo, but Bilbo unwittingly used the ring and escaped his notice. Gollum led Bilbo to the eastern door of the goblin-tunnels, through which Bilbo departed in safety.<ref name=""Riddles"" /> Soon after leaving the caves Bilbo found his companions and used the Ring to slip past Balin, the look-out. [[Balin]] was very impressed that he hadn't noticed Bilbo and his reputation among the dwarves increased. Bilbo told Gandalf and the dwarves about his encounter with Gollum and his escape, but he said nothing of the ring. Thus he rejoined his fellow adventurers.<ref name=""Pan"">{{H|6}}</ref>

The company had not journeyed long when they heard the howl of a [[Wargs|Warg]]. On Gandalf's order they climbed in a group of trees. Bilbo, however, was not able to climb in one of the trees:<ref name=""Pan"" />
{{blockquote|He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it.|{{H|6}}}}
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo woke with the early sun in his eyes.jpg|thumb|""Bilbo woke with the early sun in his eyes"" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
With the help of Dori, Bilbo managed to climb in one of the trees. Immediately thereafter, hundreds of Wargs arrived. Gandalf kept them at bay with pyrotechnical pinecones, but eventually goblins came and set the trees on fire.  Even Gandalf had begun to despair when the [[Eagles]] of [[Gwaihir]] came to rescue them, taking Bilbo last. The Eagles brought them first to [[Eagle's Eyrie|a wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side]], where they spent the night,<ref name=""Pan"" /> and then to the [[Carrock]].<ref name=""Queer"">{{H|7}}</ref> Bilbo did not enjoy his experience being carried by his rescuers, apparently suffering from a fear of heights.<ref name=""Pan"" />

====Across Wilderland====
From the Carrock they came to [[Beorn]]'s [[Beorn's Hall|Hall]]. Gandalf took only Bilbo at first, but with a story introduced the dwarves in pairs of two, convincing Beorn to invite them for dinner. Bilbo slept uneasily, fearing to be killed by Beorn, while the company spent the night in Beorn's hall. They remained in Beorn's hall, while Beorn had disappeared, for the next two days. On the third day of their stay Beorn returned and gave them mounts, bows, and stocks. He also provided them with council for their coming journey. They departed Beorn's house and travelled three days before they arrived at the edge of [[Mirkwood]]. Bilbo alone (and perhaps Gandalf) noticed that a bear still followed them. At the edge of Mirkwood they returned the ponies, and Gandalf said farewell to Bilbo and the Dwarves. Bilbo was saddened by Gandalf's parting.<ref name=""Queer"" />

After many days' journey the company came to the [[Enchanted River]]. Bilbo noted that there was a boat at the other shore. Fíli threw an iron hook to grapple the boat and pulled it across the river toward them. The company crossed the river in pairs. While crossing the river, Bombur fell in. They rescued him, but he was asleep because of the river's magic and had to be carried on a litter. Eventually, the dwarves started to give up hope and sent Bilbo to climb a tree midway through the wood. Bilbo declared he could see only trees, not realising they were at the bottom of a bowl formation. Giving up hope, the company noticed campfires of the feasting [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and, despite the warnings of Beorn and Gandalf, they left the [[Old Forest Road|road]] to contact the elves. However, whenever the company tried to contact them, they extinguished the fires, leaving a complete darkness in the forest, and disappeared suddenly. Thrice the dwarves tried to contact the Elves but all of their attempts failed. After their third attempt Bilbo lost his companions.<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|8}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Butterflies Above Mirkwood.jpg|thumb|""[[Butterflies]] above [[Mirkwood]]"" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Later, a [[Spiders|spider]] attacked Bilbo, who had fallen asleep. Bilbo woke up in time to defend himself with his little blade. He named his blade ''[[Sting]]'' after his first kill. Bilbo discovered that his companions had been captured by the spiders and stowed in their webs. Calling the spiders' names, he lured them away (with [[The One Ring|his ring]]) and came back to rescue the Dwarves. When the spiders returned, the dwarves fought them in a long battle. Eventually, the company won with no serious injuries, but found out that Thorin was missing. Unknown to Bilbo and the other Dwarves, he had been captured by the Wood-elves whose feasts they had interrupted.<ref name=""Flies"" /> Shortly after the fight with the spiders the remaining members of the company were also captured and brought before [[Thranduil]], king of Mirkwood. Bilbo, with his ring, escaped notice and thus capture. He followed the elves into the [[Elvenking's Halls]], where the dwarves refused to tell their errand to Thranduil and were locked up.<ref name=""Barrels"">{{H|9}}</ref> 

[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (II).jpg|200px|thumb|""Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves"" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
Later, exploring the elven halls with the aid of his magic ring, Bilbo discovered that Thorin was also captured by Thranduil and devised a plan for the dwarves to escape. One day, [[Galion]] (Thranduil's butler) and the head of the guard, were drunk, and Bilbo was able to steal the keys. He freed the Dwarves from their cells and packed them in barrels. His plan worked, with the dwarves being packed and launched into the [[Forest River]].  Poor Bilbo was forced to cling to the barrels, invisible, and grew cold and wet.<ref name=""Barrels"" />

{{blockquote|He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really empty, and floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above.|{{H|9}}}}

Upon reaching the [[Long Lake]], Bilbo, with the aid of Thorin, Fili and Kili, searched for the barrels with Dwarves and freed them. They then went to [[Lake-town]], where they received a warm welcome. The [[Master of Lake-town]] invited Thorin and his companions to the feast he'd organised. Despite the feigned hospitality of the [[Master of Lake-town]] and his people Bilbo had an awful cold and could hardly say anything during the banquet. The company stayed two weeks in Lake-town. They were given new ponies and provisions for many days, and they were brought, by boat, to the northern tip of the Long Lake.<ref>{{H|10}}</ref>

====Encounter with the Dragon====
On their way again, the party came to the [[Lonely Mountain]] when autumn waned. Thorin sent Balin, Fíli, Kíli and Bilbo to spy the [[Front Gate]]. Bilbo saw smoke coming out of the front gate, which made the party assume that Smaug was still alive. They returned to their camp and at Bilbo's suggestion they started to search for the [[Back Door]] at the western slopes of the Lonely Mountain. Eventually, the company discovered the back door. But none of them were able to open it, and Bilbo sat for days on the doorstep, thinking.  Soon the dwarves began to grumble about the hobbit, but Bilbo finally solved the riddle of the thrush knocking at the last light of Durin's Day:<ref name=""Doorstep"">{{H|11}}</ref>

{{blockquote|At the very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!<br/>Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the dwarves, shouting and waving.|{{H|11}}}}
[[File:Olanda Fong-Surdenas - Smaug the Mighty.jpg|thumb|left|''Smaug the Mighty'' by [[Olanda Fong-Surdenas]]]] 
The dwarves found that he was right, and with the key managed to open the passage.<ref name=""Doorstep"" /> Bilbo was, of course, elected to enter the passage first, taking only [[Balin]] with him. Soon Balin halted, but Bilbo went on, finding Smaug's lair and stealing a single jewelled cup before returning. While the Dwarves passed the retrieved treasure to each other and praised Bilbo for his deed, they heard the mountain rumbling. Bilbo had done ill in this, Smaug had awoken and was raged when he missed his cup. Smaug ravaged the mountain and the dwarves were forced to hide in the tunnel, though they lost their ponies. Despite their grumbling, the dwarves had begun to rely on Bilbo's advice for their course of action, and agreed to wait. Bilbo soon decided, however, to return and try and find a weakness in Smaug.  Slipping on his ring, he approached the dragon's hoard.<ref name=""Inside"">{{H|12}}</ref>

Gandalf had indeed done well in choosing Bilbo, for the old worm did not recognise Bilbo's scent, neither could see him, and was puzzled.  Nevertheless he sensed the hobbit's presence, and challenged him. Knowing that it would be unwise to reveal his true name or stay quiet, Bilbo replied with a series of riddles, which no dragon can resist puzzling out.  Bilbo gave himself a series of names such as ""[[Ringwinner]]"" and ""[[Luck]]wearer"", referring to his adventures on the way to the Mountain.  Becoming pleased with his riddling, one of the names Bilbo conferred upon himself was ""Barrel-rider"", and flattered the dragon:<ref name=""Inside"" /> 

{{Blockquote|""Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear you breathe. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!""<br/>But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. ""No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!"" he replied.<br/>""I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.""<br/>""Do you now?"" said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not believe a word of it.<br/>""Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities,"" replied Bilbo.<br/>""You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,"" said the dragon.|{{H|12}}}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Scouring the Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Scouring the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
This confrontation did not last especially long, for Bilbo tricked Smaug into showing his underside. Bilbo then saw the gap in the dragon's hard scales, an unprotected place.  Bilbo, upon seeing this, cracked a joke and hastily departed, and for this was nearly burned to death. All the same, he escaped and recovered, and told the dwarves what he had learned. This indirectly aided the company, for a [[Thrushes|thrush]] overheard, and this would prove beneficial in the end.<ref name=""Inside"" />

====Death of Smaug====
As darkness fell, Bilbo urged the dwarves to close the door for fear of Smaug's vengeance. Reluctantly, but at last, they gave in. Just as the door closed, Smaug ravaged the side of the mountain, blocking up the door and destroying the doorstep. However, by mentioning the word ""Barrel-rider"", Bilbo had led Smaug to believe that the company had been aided by the people of Laketown.<ref name=""Inside"" /> Thus, Smaug wreaked his vengeance on Laketown. Smaug destroyed the town, but one company of archers, led by [[Bard]], resisted the dragon. When his last arrow, the [[black arrow]], remained, a thrush, who had overheard Bilbo talking about the unprotected patch of Smaug's skin, fluttered around Bard's shoulder. The Thrush passed his knowledge on to Bard who, armed with the knowledge, shot Smaug dead. Smaug fell onto the town, which was devastated by the dragon's attack, but Bard survived and swam to the shores of the lake. There, Bard, an heir of [[Girion]] of [[Dale]], was proclaimed by the people to be king of restored Dale. Bard summoned [[Thranduil]] to help rebuild Laketown and Dale in return for part of the treasure. The armies of Mirkwood and Lake-town joined together and marched to the Lonely Mountain to take their share of the treasure.<ref>{{H|14}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarves decided to inspect the hoard while Smaug was away. During this time Bilbo stumbled across a gigantic and beautiful gem. Recalling an earlier conversation, Bilbo realised that it was the famous [[Arkenstone]], but felt strangely reluctant to give it up. Instead, he put it in his pocket and continued on. After a song and gathering of treasure, Thorin gave Bilbo a beautiful [[Mithril-coat|coat]] of ''[[mithril]]'' as the first reward for his services. Thorin led the party to the front gate, and then Balin led them to the [[guardroom]], where they sheltered.<ref>{{H|13}}</ref>

After Bilbo and his companions awoke the next morning they found that many birds, including the aforementioned Trush, assembled at the Lonely Mountain. Although the Thrush tried to say something to the company, none of them could understand him. Therefore the Thrush summoned the [[Ravens|raven]] [[Roäc]], who was able to speak [[Westron]]. Roäc told Bilbo and the dwarves about the events in Lake-town and told Thorin about the approaching armies. He counselled them to make peace with Bard and Thranduil, though it cost them dearly in gold. Thorin rejected this advice and announced that he would not share the treasure with anyone. Then, Thorin sent Roäc as a messenger to his cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]], lord of the [[Iron Hills]], to request aid. The next days they made preparations and blocked the gate with a wall, while they received news from the ravens.<ref name=""Gathering"">{{H|15}}</ref>

====The Battle of Five Armies and return journey====
{{Blockquote|There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.|[[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]], ''[[The Return Journey]]''}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|""[[Arkenstone|The Arkenstone]]"" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When Bard and Thranduil came to the Front gate, Thorin harshly responded in polite words to Bard.  Bard's reasoning did little for the stubborn King under the Mountain and Thorin rejected Bard's proposal to share the treasure.<ref name=""Gathering"" /> Bilbo feared war, and to prevent this gave the Arkenstone into the hands of [[Bard]] for negotiation.  With the praise of Bard, Thranduil, and Gandalf he returned, only to be rejected and cast away for his deed by Thorin.  But Bilbo was successful in that Thorin was willing to negotiate, and war was prevented temporarily.

And yet war did come. [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]], at the summons of Thorin, came from the [[Iron Hills]] with an army of Dwarves. Bard refused to let the dwarves enter the mountain, which would mean a long and almost certainly unsuccessful siege. But just as battle was about to be joined, Gandalf called them all to be wary of the new coming danger - the alliance of [[Wargs]] and [[Orcs|Goblins]] against them.  Dáin, Bard, and Thranduil took council together, and decided upon a strategy of defending the slopes of the Lonely Mountain.  Then the enemy came.  Thus was the [[Battle of Five Armies]] fought.
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Death of Thorin Oakenshield.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Thorin Oakenshield'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]
During the battle Bilbo stood with Thranduil and Gandalf on [[Ravenhill]].  As the battle went against the Men, Dwarves, and Elves, Bilbo reflected gloomily on the ingloriousness of war and the bitterness of the end.  But then the [[Eagles]] of [[Gwaihir]] came, and [[Beorn]] too, and the battle was won.  But Bilbo did not see this result, for a falling stone knocked him out.  Invisible as he was, his bruised body was not discovered until the next day.  Bilbo then bade farewell to the mortally wounded Thorin and his other friends.  
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|thumb|right|''The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
The victors divided the treasure and Bard took Bilbo's fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the Arkenstone. Bilbo, despite having forfeited his share, was offered a rich reward but refused to take more than two small chests of gold and silver. When Bilbo and Gandalf bid farewell to Thranduil Bilbo gave him a necklace of silver and pearls. Thranduil gave the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] the title ""[[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]]"" and then he returned with Gandalf to [[the Shire]]. There he discovered that he was believed dead, and an auction was going on of his house and possessions. He bought back his own things, and settled once more peacefully into [[Bag End]].

===Years between===
[[File:Michele Mantoani - Bilbo Baggins.jpg|thumb|""Bilbo Baggins"" by [[:Category:Images by Michele Mantoani|Michele Mantoani]]]]
Bilbo lived on in health and comfort. He was considered somewhat of an oddity, because of his unexplained wealth and his travelling nature and also because he stopped growing old at 50, these of course having their explanation in his previous adventure.<ref name=""party"">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Occasionally he received strange visitors; dwarves or Gandalf, or he often left the Shire for journeys from time to time. Other hobbits looked at him with amazement and suspicion, but his generous and kind nature put him high in the regard of those who knew him best especially the poorest and less significant hobbits.<ref name=""party"" />

Although he had no close friends, he maintained visiting relations with his relatives (except the [[Sackville-Bagginses]]) and especially favored young [[Frodo Baggins]], his cousin from both the side of his father and mother; and with whom they shared same birthday. Frodo was an orphan living in [[Brandy Hall]], crowded with ""queer"" [[Bucklanders|Bucklander]] [[Brandybuck Family|relatives]], until {{TA|2989}} when Bilbo adopted Frodo as his heir, and raised him in Bag End. Together they celebrated lively their common birthdays and Bilbo was notorious for his (inevitable) after-dinner speeches, reciting boring poetry and, after drinking, allusions to his absurd adventures.<ref name=""party"" /> The two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the [[Water-valley]] and talked about adventure; they were often seen by [[Wandering Companies]] of [[Elves]] (although the hobbits did not see them). When they returned home Bilbo often told Frodo that the Road is like a big dangerous river and all porches are its ""springs"" and all paths are its ""tributaries"".<ref name=""three"" />

Most of his time was spent reading, writing [[There and Back Again|his memoirs]], which only Frodo was allowed to read, writing poetry, translating [[Elvish]] and avoiding his nasty relatives. Young [[Sam Gamgee]] started helping [[Hamfast Gamgee|his father]] tending the garden, whom Bilbo taught reading and writing and also some poetry and lore,<ref name=""party"" /> such as ''[[The Fall of Gil-galad]]'' (which Sam wrongly believed Bilbo composed himself).<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

Despite his health and youthfulness, Bilbo himself began to feel ''stretched'' and thin. As time passed and he used his magic ring (and perhaps because of [[Sauron]]'s growing power), his mind was preoccupied with it, often worrying if it is safe and checking on it; once he tried locking it somewhere but he couldn't relax if it wasn't in his pocket, and wanted to use it more often. Sometimes he felt it like ""an eye"" watching on him.<ref name=""party"" />

===Bilbo's Farewell Party===
[[File:Livia Prima - Bilbo's Party.jpg|thumb|""[[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Party]]"" by [[:Category:Images by Livia Prima|Livia Prime]]]]
At last, in September of {{TA|3001}}, Bilbo threw a [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|grand party]] for his 111th birthday (which happened to be shared with Frodo) that was long prepared and Bilbo became the favourite matter of gossip for the region. During this party he gave [[Bilbo’s Birthday Speech|a speech]], did a vanishing act with his ring and sneaked to Bag End. He only took with him a [[There and Back Again|book]] that he was composing, his sword [[Sting]], his [[mithril coat]], and a dark green hood and cloak which had been given to him by [[Thorin]] years before. He attempted to leave the Ring for Frodo, along with [[Bag End]] and the rest of his possessions, but had an internal struggle; he left it only thanks to the urging of Gandalf, and Bilbo was the first ringbearer to give up the One Ring in this way. [[Nar (companion of Bilbo)|Three]] [[Anar (dwarf)|Dwarven]] [[Hannar|companions]] were working on his farewell gifts, and left for the east with them.<ref name=""party"" />

On his way to the east he passed through [[Woody End]] and said farewell to [[Gildor]] and other [[Elves]] at their encampment above [[Woodhall]].<ref name=""three"">{{FR|Three}}</ref> The [[Third Age 3002|next year]] he visited Rivendell and became a guest of Elrond<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and apparently he met Gildor once more again around there.<ref name=""three"" /><ref group=""note"">Gildor says he met Bilbo a second time far from the Shire, and as Gildor presumably is one of the [[Elves of Rivendell]], it's possible they met at or near Rivendell.</ref>

===End of the Third Age===
[[File:Andrea Piparo - Bilbo in Rivendell.jpg|thumb|''Bilbo in Rivendell'' by [[:Category:Images by Andrea Piparo|Andrea Piparo]]]]
He lived a very pleasant life of retirement in Rivendell: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoir, ''[[There and Back Again]]'' and wrote a book called ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]''.

When Frodo came to Rivendell seventeen years later, they reunited in the [[Hall of Fire]]. While alone, Bilbo mentioned his old ring to Frodo, wishing to see it, but Frodo refused and a shadow fell upon the two. Bilbo briefly turned into a fleshy figure, though he quickly apologized. Shortly afterwards Bilbo finishes composing (with [[Aragorn]]; whom he calls the ''[[Dúnadan]]'') the ''[[Eärendillinwë]]''.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

Bilbo attended the [[Council of Elrond]], offering to take the Ring to [[Mount Doom]].  Nevertheless, this task fell to the younger Frodo, and in farewell Bilbo gave him [[Sting]] and his old ''mithril'' coat, both of which served Frodo well in the struggles to come.

The [[War of the Ring]] was fought far from where Bilbo dwelt, but successfully, and in the end Frodo returned home. Because of the Ring's destruction, that prolonged his life, Bilbo started ageing again; as [[Arwen]] told to Frodo later, Bilbo started looking ancient according to his kind.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

===Passage west===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''Departure at the Grey Havens'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Two years later, however, Bilbo as a former ringbearer accompanied Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, and certain Elves to the [[Grey Havens]], there to take ship for the West, on [[29 September]], {{TA|3021}}. He had already celebrated his 131st birthday, becoming the oldest Hobbit in the history of Middle-earth. As a mortal, he died in the West.

While sailing west, Bilbo composed [[Bilbo's Last Song|a last poem]] looking back on Middle-earth in farewell.

==Legacy==
Already an eccentric during his life in Hobbiton, the disappearance of the ""Mad Baggins""  was a long-lasting discussion around the Shire. Many speculated that he got mad and seeking adventures he found his death in a river or pool, with Gandalf being responsible for not letting him settle down. Meanwhile Frodo, knowing that he is alive and well somewhere, continued to honor Bilbo's birthday along with his, every year.<ref name=""shadow"" /> Bilbo thus was one of the many legendary hobbits that were incited by Gandalf to seek adventures; and other hobbit figures of traditions (such as his uncles [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]] and [[Isengar Took|Isengar]]<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> or [[Basso Boffin]]) that were taken by the 'wandering-madness', either lost for ever, or returning to remain eccentric and uncommunicable.<ref>{{AB|Foreword}}</ref>

Many years after his second ""disappearance"" he became a fireside-story for hobbit-children, a legendary figure who used to vanish magically and reappear with bags of treasure.<ref name=""shadow"">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

Sam Gamgee named his tenth child [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]] after his hero.<ref>{{App|Samwise}}</ref>

The keepers of the Red Book who copied and translated it were unwilling to make alterations to Bilbo's own text, out of respect for the hero of old, and stuck close to it and its faults. But other later copiers of the Book, based on other notes, wrote the [[Riddles in the Dark|true account]] on the finding of the Ring, resulting to the two differing versions of the story.<ref>{{FR|Finding}}</ref>

===Literary work===
{{Quote|Bilbo was not assiduous, nor an orderly narrator, and his account is involved and discursive, and sometimes confused: faults that still appear in the Red Book, since the copiers were pious and careful, and altered very little.|{{HM|FR}}, ""Foreword"" (first edition only)}}
*A [[A Walking Song|walking-song]] (poem set on an old tune)
*[[Bilbo's will]]
*''[[There and Back Again]]''
*[[Translations from the Elvish]]
**''[[The Fall of Gil-galad]]''
*''[[Errantry]]''
*[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]
*''[[Eärendillinwë]]'' (with [[Aragorn]])

==Etymology==
Within the legendarium, ""Bilbo"" represents a translation of the original [[Hobbitish]] ''Bilba''.<ref name=""PM"" />

[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that the name ''Bilbo'' is very likely a name invented by Tolkien, a ""short, simple, made-up name appropriate for a hero of a children's book or light-hearted fantasy story"".<ref>{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 47-8</ref>

It has also been noted by [[Paula Marmor]] that [[Wikipedia:Bilbo (sword)|bilbo]] is a kind of Spanish sword deriving its name from Bilbao. The element ''bil'' (""sword"") is found in some [[Germanic]] names (such as ''Bilihar'').<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Etymological Excursion"", p. 184</ref>

According to the ''[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]'', a dictionary of Old English, the element ''bil'' refers to either a farming or military blade, significant in that it must have two edges.<ref>{{webcite|website=BT|articleurl=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/004331|articlename=BIL|accessed=25 August 2015}}</ref> The element ''bó'', equivalent to ''bá'', means both.<ref>{{webcite|website=BT|articleurl=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/0047561|articlename=bó|accessed=25 August 2015}}</ref><!--Is this actually relevant? Has anyone noticed this apart from a random TG editor?-->

:Bilbo hosts [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|an 111th birthday party]] at [[The Shire]]. He dines with [[Gandalf]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry.]] During the party, he dissapears, using [[The One Ring]]. The Narrator then recounts that Bilbo gifted Frodo the Ring as a birthday present. Later, in [[Rivendell]], Bilbo tells of [[Quest of Erebor|his journey]] and discovery of the One Ring. Bilbo tells that he discovered the curious properties of the Ring and begun to understand that it was The One. On the morning following the [[Council of Elrond]], Bilbo gifts Frodo his sword, [[Sting]], and his [[Mithril-coat]], noting that it is strong enough even to deflect the knives of [[Nazgûl|The Black Riders]], despite its light weight. After Frodo puts it on, Bilbo remarks that he looks like a true [[Hobbit]]. Before the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] departed, Frodo and Bilbo huddle in a cloak on the stairs to conserve heat. As the Fellowship departs, Bilbo wishes them good luck.

:The voice of Bilbo Baggins is provided by Marián Labuda. Though Bilbo appears as a character in the same scenes he does in the novel's narrative, his primary role is that of an omniscient, overarching narrator of the entire series. This is portrayed as Bilbo reading from and commenting on the War of the Ring while writing new chapters in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]]. There is a slightly metafictional or postmodern tone to Bilbo's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Frodo (and sometimes other characters from the Fellowship) directly, with Frodo or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Bilbo. Until his journey to the Grey Havens at the end of the story, Bilbo spends almost its entirety in Rivendell (from where he narrates and writes the Red Book and notes for it). The prologue about hobbits and the events of his 111th birthday are briefly summarized by Bilbo at the start of the first episode and then the action shifts towards Frodo and Gandalf, and then to Frodo and his three hobbit companions.

'''Thráin I''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1934|n}} – {{TA|2190|n}}, died aged 256) was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] of [[Durin's Folk]] for 209 years, succeeding his father, [[Náin I]], when he was killed by [[Durin's Bane|the Balrog]] in {{TA|1981}}. Thráin founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and was a descendant of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] via his grandfather [[Durin VI]].<ref name=""AppA"">{{App|A3}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Thrain II Discovers the Lonely Mountain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Thrain Discovers the Lonely Mountain'']]
Thráin's grandfather, Durin VI, was [[King of Khazad-dûm]] when the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]] appeared in [[Moria]]; this Balrog has forever been known as [[Durin's Bane]] as Durin was killed by it in {{TA|1980}}. Durin's son - and Thráin's father - [[Náin I]] was then King until he was himself killed in {{TA|1981|n}} and the Dwarves left Moria.<ref name=""AppA""/><ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Thráin - at the tender age of 47 - became King of [[Durin's Folk]]. He led his wandering people until {{TA|1999}} when he founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]],<ref name=ta/> whilst some settled instead in the [[Grey Mountains]]. In Erebor the [[Dwarves]] began building a mighty kingdom, discovering the prized possession of King Thráin: the [[Arkenstone]], the Heart of the Mountain.<ref name=""AppA""/>

Thráin died in {{TA|2190}} at the age of 256 and was succeeded by his son [[Thorin I]]. With a rule of 209 years, Thráin I was the longest-ruling of all the known [[Kings of Durin's Folk]] with, perhaps, the only exception being [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].

''Þráinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Stubborn"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
It is not clear whether Thráin I existed in Tolkien's mind while he was writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'' or whether he was invented later, when writing the back-story of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The phrase on [[Thrór's Map]] ""''Here of old was Thrain - [[King under the Mountain]]''""<ref>{{H|Thror}}</ref> causes some fans to claim that Tolkien wrote it for Thráin I, since [[Thráin|Thráin II]] was never a King under the Mountain.

[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[John Rateliff]] and [[Douglas Anderson]] say that Tolkien accidentally reversed the family tree Thrór --> Thráin --> Thorin to Thráin --> Thrór --> Thorin and then reverted it before final publication of the book.  Rateliff argues in his book that the original tree was favoured but that it is impossible to say which was intended to be the correct genealogy.  According to Rateliff, the first edition uses the name ""Thráin"" in two distinct contexts that support either point of view and that Tolkien only added a third element to the story (the forenote) in 1947 when he sent suggested changes to the publisher.

'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Thráin I appears in several flashbacks. In the year [[Third Age 1981|T.A. 1981]] he is shown leading the survivors evacuating from [[Khazad-dûm]] as his father makes a doomed final stand to cover their retreat. In the story narrating the history of [[Fram]] and [[Scatha]], Thráin I is the King who received the necklace of Scatha's teeth after laying claim to the [[dragon]]'s treasure, becoming greatly enraged at Fram's affront.

'''Óin''' was one of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who set out to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] from [[Smaug]]. Later, he followed [[Balin]] in an ill-fated attempt to retake [[Moria]].

==History==
Óin was the son of [[Gróin]] and older brother of [[Glóin]], both of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===The Quest of Erebor===
Óin was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]]. He wore a brown hood.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

Óin and Glóin were noted for their ability to start fires, although both failed on the night that the company met the [[trolls]]. In their frustration they began to quarrel and eventually to fight, which was the incident that prompted the company to head for the fire seen far off on a hill.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

In the glade where the wolves came to gather, Óin was one of five Dwarves who climbed up to fairly comfortable seats in a huge pine tree.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Óin and Glóin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Óin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria===
In {{TA|2989}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Óin had followed Balin with a [[Balin's folk|company]] of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient mansions of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which were occupied by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> At first the colony did well, but on [[November 10]], {{TA|2994|n}} Balin was killed, and the Orcs returned. They took the [[Great Gates|East-gate]]/[[First Hall]] then the [[Second Hall]] after a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle]] which Óin likely fought in.

Óin went with a party to find escape via the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] but they found the water up to the doors and he was taken by the [[Watcher in the Water]]. Of his party only four returned five days after they had left, and soon thereafter all the remaining colonists were killed in a [[Last stand of Balin's folk|final stand]] in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>

Their fate was unknown to their kinsmen and their silence was largely why [[Glóin]] and [[Gimli]] went to [[Rivendell]] at that time, to seek news from [[Elrond]]. When [[Frodo Baggins]] came to Rivendell, Glóin delighted in telling him about the doings of the renewed dwarf-kingdom. But when Frodo asked about Óin, Balin, and Ori, Glóin's face darkened and he said that he did not know.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Oinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means ""Shy"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Dáin I''' was the King of [[Durin's folk]] in the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|Grey Mountains]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}, p. 1072</ref>

== History ==
Dáin was the son of King [[Náin II]], and he had a younger brother [[Borin]]. He had three children: [[Thrór]], [[Frór]], and [[Grór]].

Dáin flourished during the period when the [[House of Durin]] was seated in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He succeeded his father when the [[Dragons]] of the north had declared [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war against]] the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]]. Dáin ruled his people for only four years, who were troubled by increasing attacks on his [[Dáin's Halls|halls]] until he met his premature end when both he and his second son, Frór, were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] at the gates of his hall. 

After his death, his sons Thrór and Grór led most of the [[Dwarves]] of Durin's folk east. Thrór, along with Borin his uncle, led [[Dwarves of Erebor|one group]] back to the [[Lonely Mountain]], while Grór founded [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|his own realm]] in the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Dain.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Dáinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""Deadlike"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==History==
During Óin's reign, the Longbeards continued to dwell in the [[Grey Mountains]].

Óin died in {{TA|2488}}, having reigned for 103 years, and was succeeded by his son [[Náin II|Náin]].<ref name=""AppA""/>

'''Meril-i-Turinqi''' was the '''Lady of [[Tol Eressëa]]''', according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 175</ref>

Meril dwelt in a white house inside a great ''[[korin]]'' of ancient [[elms]], near [[Tirin na Gilweth|Ingil's tower]].<ref name=""Tur"">{{LT1|IV}}, p. 95</ref> She was of great beauty and accompanied by [[Elves|Elven]] maidens.<ref name=""Mer""/>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Meril was one of the [[Inwir]], the royal clan of the [[Vanyar#Other versions of the legendarium|Teleri]],<ref>{{LT1|LinkC}}, p. 50</ref> being a great-granddaughter of [[Inwë]], the King of all the Eldar. However, she was also akin to the [[Solosimpi]], and had long ago seen the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Faëry]].<ref name=""Ing"">{{LT1|V}}, p. 129</ref>

Following the [[March of Liberation]] and the war with [[Melko]], [[Ingil]] son of Inwë, her grandfather, led the remaining Elves and [[Gnomes]] to [[Tol Eressëa]], where they built the city of [[Koromas]], later known as ''Kortirion'' due to the [[Tirin na Gilweth|great tower]] that Ingil built.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref> Later, Ingil returned to [[Valinor]],<ref name=""Ing""/> and eventually Meril became the Lady of the Isle.

At some point after the March of Liberation, when the [[Olórë Mallë]] was blocked and the children of [[Men]] could no longer visit Valinor in their sleep, one [[Eärendel|man]] nonetheless managed to find his way to the West and sought the Elves' help, to which Meril responded by asking [[Lindo]], an Elf of Tol Eressëa, to devise a plan.

Afterwards, Lindo and his wife [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] built the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] in Kortirion, from which the remaining children of Men that stayed with the Elves went to the [[Great Lands]] and comforted the Mannish children living there.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, pp. 19-20</ref>

=== Arrival of Eriol ===
Around the [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]], [[Eriol]], a Mannish mariner, arrived to Tol Eressëa. After visiting many places on the island, including the Cottage of Lost Play, [[Littleheart]] son of [[Voronwë]] brought him to Meril's house, where Eriol requested to taste ''[[limpë]]'', a magic Elven drink, seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves.

Meril denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a [[mortal]] [[Man]] to do so, as [[Ilúvatar]] made his [[Children of Ilúvatar|Children]] different, and drinking ''limpë'' would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would one day long for his lands again.<ref name=""Mer"">{{LT1|IV}}, pp. 96-7</ref> To explain better she told him the stories of ''[[the Chaining of Melko]]''<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 98</ref> and ''[[the Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr]]''.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 113</ref>

Some time after, Meril visited the Cottage of Lost Play during a festival, before Eriol went to [[Tavrobel]], where Littleheart told the tale of ''[[the Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|the Fall of Gondolin]]''.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 144-5</ref>

=== The Faring Forth ===
According to one outline for the continuation of the ''Lost Tales'', the disastrous [[Faring Forth]], the great expedition to the Great Lands for the rescue of the [[Ilkorindi|Lost Elves]], was instigated prematurely by Eriol himself against Meril's command, who, longing for his home, returned to the Great Lands and ""preached"" of the Faring Forth. Thus, due to Eriol's impatience and recklessness, the Faring Forth was doomed to fail.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref>

Nothing else is known about Meril, or her fate after the Faring Forth.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Meril-i-Turinqi'' is [[Qenya]] for ""Queen of Flowers"", being a combination of ''[[meril]]'' (""flowers"") + ''[[i]]'' (""the"") + ''[[turinqi]]'' (""queen"").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-112046301.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Meril-i-Turinqi'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=1 May 2022}}</ref>

An alternative spelling of the name was ''Meril-i-Turinqui''.<ref name=""Tur""/>

An earlier Qenya form of the name was ''Veril-i-Turinqi''.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xx</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Gnomish]] cognate for ''Meril-i-Turinqi'' is '''''Gwidhil-i-Durinthi'''''<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Meril-i-Turinqi""</ref> (changed from ''Gwedhil'') or '''''Gwithil-i-Durinthi'''''.<ref name=""Gwi""/>

Earlier Gnomish versions of the name include: ''Miril-i-durwin'',<ref>{{PE|13}}, ""[[Heraldic Devices of Tol Erethrin]]"", p. 95</ref> ''Gwedhil Turlin'',<ref>{{PE|13}}, ""[[Early Chart of Names]]"", p. 99</ref><ref group=""note"">''Gwedhil Turlin'' was changed from ''Turlith'' to ''Turing'' to ''Turingwith'' to ''Gwethil Turingwith'' and then to the final form.</ref> and ''Gwidhil (Gwedda) Durinthir''<ref>{{PE|15}}, ""[[Names and Required Alterations]]"", p. 7</ref> (with ''Gwedda'' being a diminutive of ''Gwidhil'', later changed to ''Gwetha'').<ref name=""Gwi"">{{PE|11}}, p. 46</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Early legendarium ===
In an earlier text in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', the role of Meril-i-Turinqi was instead given to [[Erinti]], at that time imagined as the [[Valar|Vala]] of love, music, beauty and purity who, like Meril in the later texts, lived in a ''korin'' of elms in the center of Tol Eressëa.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 36</ref>

=== Later legendarium ===
According to [[John Garth]], the character of [[Galadriel]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' might have been inspired by Meril-i-Turinqi.<ref name=""Wit"">[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', ""Part three"", ''12. Tol Withernon and Fladweth Amrod'', p. 228</ref>

In one text from the later [[legendarium]], the name ''[[Amarië#Other versions of the legendarium|Meril]]'' appears as the name of the wife of [[Felagund]] and the mother of [[Gil-galad]].<ref>{{WJ|15}}, p. 242</ref>

'''Celeborn''' was one of the noblest of the [[Sindar]]<ref name=RGEONotes>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 60</ref><ref name=TimeScales>{{NM|P1ix}}, calculation for Galadriel in a manuscript from c. 1959, p. 65</ref> — who wedded the Lady [[Galadriel]] of the [[House of Finarfin]] and with her, he remained in [[Middle-earth]] after the end of the [[First Age]]. 

==History==
===Early life===
[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|left|thumb|''Love at First Sight'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]
Celeborn was a [[Sindar]]in prince of [[Doriath]],<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref> being the grandson of [[Elmo]],<ref>In some texts, Celeborn is considered as the son of Elmo. See for example {{NM|P1xviii}}, p.149.</ref> the brother of [[Thingol]]; thus, he was the grand-nephew of the [[King of Doriath]].<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

In the late [[First Age]], [[Finrod]] and [[Galadriel]] came to Doriath as guests of Thingol. There, Celeborn and Galadriel met, fell in love, and were soon betrothed. Galadriel remained in Doriath with Celeborn after [[Finrod]] went to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=Return/>

For the rest of the [[First Age]], Celeborn and Galadriel are not mentioned to have played any significant role in the general course of events of the Age, while their relatives, both [[Sindar]] and [[Noldor]], did. By the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495}}, Galadriel passed over the [[Blue Mountains]] so it seems likely that Celeborn followed her although this is not known for certain.<ref name=mirror>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>

===Second Age===
After the [[War of wrath|fall of Beleriand]], Celeborn and Galadriel lived in [[Lindon]] for some time. Celeborn ruled the fief of [[Harlindon]], which was composed mostly of [[Sindar]], under [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]].<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref>

[[Galadriel]] and Celeborn crossed into [[Eriador]] with many [[Noldor]], [[Sindar]], and [[Green-elves]] in their following. For a while, they dwelt in the country about [[Lake Nenuial]], ruling the Eldar in Eriador, including the wandering companies of the native Nandor. Probably around {{SA|300}}, a daughter was born to Galadriel and Celeborn, named [[Celebrían]].<ref name=TimeScales/> They departed for [[Eregion]] and arrived there by {{SA|750}}.<ref name=concerning/><ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref> It was ruled by [[Celebrimbor]], grandson of Fëanor and the distant half-cousin of Galadriel. 

It was only sometime between {{SA|1350}} and {{SA|1400|n}}<ref name=concerning/> that [[Galadriel]] crossed the [[Hithaeglir]] through [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and relocated there with their daughter Celebrían, becoming great among the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]].<ref name=concerning/> Celeborn decided to stay in [[Eregion]] due to his enmity towards the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves]].<ref name=concerning/> It is said that Celeborn fought in the [[Sack of Eregion]] leading the remnants of Eregion out of the battle. He and [[Elrond]] narrowly escaped to a dell, where the latter founded [[Rivendell]].<ref name=concerning/> 

After the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], Galadriel passed again through [[Moria]] with [[Celebrían]] and came to [[Imladris]], seeking Celeborn.<ref name=concerning/> There she found him, and there they dwelt together for a long time.<ref name=concerning/> Some time later, [[Galadriel]] and Celeborn departed from Imladris and went to the little-inhabited lands between the mouth of the [[Gwathló]] and [[Ethir Anduin]].<ref name=concerning/> There they dwelt in [[Belfalas]], at the place that was afterwards called [[Dol Amroth]]; and their company was swelled by [[Silvan Elves]] from [[Lórinand]].<ref name=concerning/>

===Third Age===
[[File:Rowena Morrill - The Swan-Boat of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|right|""The Swan-Boat of Galadriel"" by [[:Category:Images by Rowena Morrill|Rowena Morrill]]]]
After long journeys in [[Rhovanion]], from [[Gondor]] and the borders of [[Mordor]] to [[Thranduil]] in the [[Woodland Realm|north]], Celeborn and Galadriel passed over the mountains to [[Imladris]], and there dwelt for many years.<ref name=""AaN"">{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> It was there, in {{TA|109}},<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> that his daughter [[Celebrían]] wedded [[Elrond]] Half-elven of [[Rivendell]]. 

When [[Amroth]], the [[King of Lórien]], perished in {{TA|1981}}, Celeborn and Galadriel took up the rule of Lindórinand jointly, and were called the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim|Lord and Lady]] of Lothlórien, the new name for Lindórinand, and together, they built [[Caras Galadhon]].

During the [[War of the Ring]] in {{TA|3019}}, Lothlórien received the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], composed of various travellers on the [[Quest of the Ring|quest]] to destroy [[the One Ring]]. Celeborn and Galadriel offered advice and boats for the [[Anduin]], sending them on their way. After the [[Galadhrim]] repelled the forces of [[Dol Guldur]] three times, Celeborn led the forces of the Galadhrim across the [[Anduin]] and [[Fall of Dol Guldur|took the fortress]]. Galadriel threw down its walls and purified the forest.<ref name=great>{{app|Great}}</ref><ref name=chief>{{app|Chief}}</ref>

On [[6 April]],<ref name=chief/> that was the [[Yestarë|Elven day of New Year]], [[Thranduil]] met with Celeborn in the midst of [[Mirkwood]] and renamed it ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]'', ""The Wood of the Green Leaves"". With the forest now cleansed, it was divided among the Elves and Men; Celeborn took all the forest south of the [[Narrows]] and established [[East Lórien]].<ref name=great/>

Celeborn attended the wedding of [[Aragorn II Elessar]] and his granddaughter [[Arwen]], and on the journey to return, he bade a fond farewell to [[Treebeard]] as well. He and Galadriel escorted [[Gandalf]] and the [[Hobbits]] until the [[Mountains of Moria]], and on [[13 September]] they turned to return to [[Lothlórien]].<ref name=chief/>

===Later history===
After Galadriel's departure, it is believed that Celeborn relocated to [[Rivendell]] to reside with [[Elladan]], [[Elrohir]], and some of the [[Noldor]], having also grown weary of [[East Lórien]].<ref name=prologue/><ref name=great/>

At some unknown date (possibly between {{FoA|120}} and {{FoA|171|n}}),<ref group=""note"">The Last Ship could not have sailed before {{FoA|120}} based on [[Aragorn]]'s final words to [[Arwen]]. Aragorn suggests Arwen might still take passage on a ship from Mithlond into the West, but by this time Arwen had long forfeited the right to live in the [[Undying Lands]]. The words ""and some say [Círdan] dwells there still, until the Last Ship sets sail into the West"" derive from the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], and not from the ''original'' [[Red Book]], which has not been preserved, but from a copy of it, the first of them being the [[Thain's Book]], copied in {{FoA|171}}. Thus, the speculation about [[Círdan]] still dwelling in [[Mithlond]] cannot be exactly dated to a period before [[Aragorn II Elessar|Elessar]]'s and [[Arwen]]'s death. This means that the Last Ship would have sailed at some unknown date after {{FoA|171}}.</ref> he sought the [[Grey Havens]] and sailed west aboard [[Last Ship]] with his mighty kinsman [[Cirdan the Shipwright]], but when he did so, he took with him the last memory of the [[Elder Days]] in Middle-earth.<ref name=prologue/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Celeborn.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Celeborn'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''[[celeb]]'' (""silver"") + a derivative of ''[[ornā]]'' (""tall""). ''Teleporno'', his original [[Telerin]] name, has an identical meaning. The name Teleporno was ""Sindarized"" as ''Celeborn'': [[Telerin]] ''[[telepi|telpe]]'' (""silver"") (Quenya ''[[telpe|tyelpe]]'') was transformed to Sindarin ''celeb''.<ref>{{UT|6e}}</ref> Teleporno's name gained an additional [[Quenya]] form, '''[[Telporno]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[telˈporno]}}).<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>

He was given the epithet ""the Wise"" by Galadriel.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}, twenty-fifth paragraph</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Before the summer of 1950 in an earlier version of the [[The Appendix on Languages|Appendix on Languages]] it was mentioned that the native language of Celeborn was ''[[Telerin|Telerian]]'', the native language of the Teleri who remained behind in the north-west of Middle-earth, of the Elves of Lórien and of the elf-kingdom in Northern Mirkwood of [[Thranduil]], and that in the household of [[Galadriel]] also ''[[Noldorin]]'' was spoken, because she was a Noldo.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, §18, p. 36 and §3 - §5, commentary §18, pp. 65-66</ref> It thus appears that Celeborn was a wood-elf in this earlier version. In a later version of the Appendix on Languages following a major revision of 1951, it is first mentioned that Celeborn was a Sinda (Grey-elf) and that most of the people of Lórien were of a woodland race.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F4</ref> The text in the final version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' only mentions that Celeborn was a kinsman of [[Thingol]].<ref>{{App|SA}}, second paragraph</ref><ref>{{App|Elves}} third paragraph mentioning that the Exiles had adopted Sindarin and that Galadriel was the noblest of all</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' does not mention the ancestry of Celeborn and if he was a Sinda or a Teler from [[Valinor]]. The text in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' also only mentions that Celeborn was a ''kinsman of Thingol'' and that Galadriel stayed in [[Doriath]], because Celeborn lived there and did not accompany her brother [[Finrod]] to [[Nargothrond]],<ref name=Return/> and that Celeborn was a ''prince of Doriath''<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> and calls him ''Celeborn of Doriath''.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref><ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> ''The Silmarillion'' leaves the ancestry of Celeborn open and there is no mention if he was a Sinda or Teler, only implying that Galadriel met Celeborn in Doriath.

In a table with the descendants of Thingol from December 1959 Thingol's younger brother [[Elmo]] has a son [[Galadhon]] who has two sons, Celeborn and [[Galathil]], and a daughter, [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]], who married King [[Dior]]. However, on the same table Nimloth also appears as the daughter of Galathil. It looks as if the second thought of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was that Nimloth was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Celeborn.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, stage 'D', p. 257</ref> The genealogy according to this second thought was included in [[Unfinished Tales]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, last paragraph before the section Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn, p. 233</ref> According to that table, Celeborn is thus the greatnephew of Thingol and second cousin of Galadriel.

In a text written in 1965,<ref>{{NM|P1xviii}}, p.149, footnote with a star.</ref> Celeborn is born in [[Beleriand]] and he is a descendant of [[Elmo]]. 

Only a note in [[The Road Goes Ever On]], which was published in 1967 during J.R.R. Tolkien's lifetime, strictly mentions that Celeborn was a Sinda.<ref name=RGEONotes/>

===Telerin descent===
According to an alternate history of Celeborn and Galadriel in [[Unfinished Tales]], Celeborn was a [[Teler]] of noble rank in [[Alqualondë]],<ref name=AAm>{{MR|P2o}}, notes and corrections, §149</ref> born '''[[Teleporno]]''',<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 347, 364 (note 46)</ref> grandson of [[Olwë]], prince of [[Alqualondë]] (thus he was a kinsman of [[Thingol]] in [[Beleriand]]).<ref name=""GC"">{{UT|Galadriel}}, eighteenth paragraph</ref> Only nine months before his death, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] still was of the opinion that Celeborn was only a kinsman of Thingol afar off, because Celeborn came from Valinor and that his orginal name was ''Telporno''.<ref>{{L|347}}, answer to question 3</ref>

In one c. [[1969]] version of the legendarium, Celeborn was the son of a [[Falmari|Telerin]] [[Elf]] called [[Gilitīro]].<ref>{{PE|23b}}, p. 143</ref>

[[Galadriel|Artanis]], Olwë's granddaughter and a [[Noldor]]in princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet ''[[Alatáriel]]'', meaning ""Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland"".<ref name=""Shib"">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> 

Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|First Kinslaying]].<ref name=AAm/><ref name=""GC""/> Nevertheless, Artanis’s heart was fired by the stories of [[Fëanor]] of the open lands across the [[Belegaer|sea]]. She urged Teleporno to take a ship eastward to [[Endor]], and he gave in. In doing so the two fell under the [[Ban of the Valar]].

In Beleriand, Teleporno and Artanis were greeted by [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], [[King of Doriath]]. Teleporno eventually ""[[Sindarization|Sindarized]]"" his name to Celeborn; Artanis Sindarinized the epithet Celeborn had given her, and Alatáriel became Galadriel.

===Controversy===
{{blockquote|On the other hand, the making of Celeborn into a Telerin Elf of Aman contradicts not only statements in ''The Silmarillion'', but also those cited already from The Road Goes Ever On and Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings”|[[Christopher Tolkien]], ""[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]""}}
Celeborn as a Telerin prince seems a late development. This altered origin was not adopted into the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', primarily because it contradicted published [[canon]], and was not incorporated in Tolkien's drafts of the earlier parts, and therefore would have necessitated a major rewrite by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] to account for a separate departure of Galadriel. It is unknown whether Tolkien would have revised the story or would have felt bound by published writings.

Celeborn's Telerin ancestry would have made the couple first cousins. ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' states that among the [[Eldar]] first cousins might marry, but seldom did so or desired to do so.<ref>{{MR|Laws}}</ref> Furthermore, the published ''Silmarillion'' states ""Eldar wedded not with kin so near,"" in reference to [[Maeglin]]'s attraction to his first cousin [[Idril]].<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

'''Orodreth''' was a lord of the [[Noldor]] and a dynast of the [[House of Finarfin]]. He served as the warden of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] under his uncle [[Finrod]] until the fortress was overrun by [[Sauron]].

After Finrod’s death, Orodreth was proclaimed [[King of Nargothrond]] but was killed during the [[Fall of Nargothrond|fall of the city]]. He was the son of the Noldorin lord [[Angrod]] and the father of [[Finduilas]] and [[Gil-galad]].<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />

Orodreth was noted as being among the [[Lambengolmor]], ""the greatest, kings, princes and warriors"" among the Elves.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />{{rp|note 23}}

==History==
===Early History===
He was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]]. His name in [[Quenya]] was '''''Artaresto'''''.<ref name=""Galad"" />

During the [[Flight of the Noldor]], Orodreth spoke softly and sought to calm the Noldor to reflect before taking the decision to leave [[Aman]].<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref> After the return of the Noldor to [[Middle-earth]] and the completion of [[Nargothrond]], Orodreth's uncle [[Finrod]] gave the fortress of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] to Orodreth's keeping.<ref name=""Beleriand"">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

Orodreth held the fortress of Minas Tirith in the vale of [[Sirion]] until shortly after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] [[Sauron]], lieutenant of [[Morgoth]], overran the isle, took Minas Tirith by storm and turned it into [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the Isle of Werewolves, in {{FA|457}}. Orodreth had to flee from Minas Tirith south to [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=""Fingolfin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

===Arrival of Beren===
[[File:Ebe Kastein - King Orodreth.jpg|225px|thumb|left|''King Orodreth'' by [[:Category:Images by Ebe Kastein|Ebe Kastein]]]]
When [[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]] came to Nargothrond in {{FA|465}}, Finrod, the [[King of Nargothrond]], decided to accompany him on his [[quest for the Silmaril]], fulfilling his oath. However, [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the [[Sons of Fëanor]], were also at Nargothrond at the time, and persuaded almost all the people of Nargothrond to refuse to accompany Finrod on the quest for the Silmaril so that only [[Edrahil]] and ten companions agreed to go with Finrod and Beren. Finrod gave his crown to Orodreth to rule Nargothrond as a regent in his absence. With Finrod gone, Celegorm and Curufin further swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond, and Orodreth had no power to withstand them. The ultimate goal of the brothers was to take control of all Elf-kingdoms before then seeking the Silmarils.  When news came that Finrod had been killed and that Tol-in-Gaurhoth had been destroyed, the sons of Fëanor were shamed and fell from power, as the people cried out that the maiden [[Lúthien]] had done what the sons of Fëanor dared not. Orodreth returned to power and expelled Celegorm and Curufin from Nargothrond.<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Arrival of Túrin===
In {{FA|487}}, word of the inspiring deeds of [[Túrin]] and [[Beleg]], the ""Two Captains"" of [[Dor-Cúarthol]] who had thrown the power of Angband back, became known in Nargothrond. Many there grew restless, believing that if an outlaw could do such hurt to the Enemy, what might not the Lord of Narog do. Orodreth, however, would permit none of his people to join Túrin, and sent messages that Túrin was not to set foot in Nargothrond or drive Orcs into it. He did, however, offer help other than arms, possibly being moved to do so by Thingol and Melian with whom exchanged messages with.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref>

[[File:Alarie - Turin in front of Orodreth.jpg|thumb|''Túrin in front of Orodreth'' by [[:Category:Images by Alarie|Alarie]]]]
In {{FA|490}},<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> [[Gwindor]], a prince of Nargothrond and an escaped thrall of Morgoth returning from his captivity in [[Angband]], led [[Túrin]] son of [[Húrin]], a [[Man]] of the [[House of Hador]] to Nargothrond. In Nargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself ''[[Agarwaen]]'', son of ''[[Úmarth]]'' (""Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate""). [[Finduilas]], daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him ''Thurin'' (""The Secret""). He was also called ''Adanedhel'' (""Man-Elf"") because he was so alike to an Elf, though he was a Man.<ref name=""Narn"">{{UT|Narn}}</ref><ref name=""Turin"">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name=""CH10"">{{CH|10}}</ref>

His identity did not remain hidden for long. Gwindor revealed to Finduilas that 'Agarwaen' was in fact Túrin, and 'Úmarth' his famous father Húrin. When the news of this reached Finduilas' father, Orodreth, King of Nargothrond, Túrin was given great honor and standing, but the revelation of Túrin's identity would also bring Morgoth's curse with him.<ref name=""Narn"" /><ref name=""Turin"" /><ref name=""CH10"" />
[[File:Alan Lee - Fall of Nargothrond.jpg|225px|thumb|left|''Fall of Nargothrond'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Túrin became a chief counselor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the people of Nargothrond to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with [[Gurthang]], his black sword, he himself became known as ''Mormegil'' (""Black Sword"").<ref name=""Narn"" /><ref name=""Turin"" /><ref name=""CH10"" />

However, sometime after, two messengers, named [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], sent there by [[Círdan]], arrived to Nargothrond, delivering the message from [[Ulmo]], Lord of Waters himself, to the King Orodreth, advising him to shut the doors of Nargothrond and destroy the bridge before its gates. At this time Orodreth relied upon the counsel of Túrin, who scorned the words of the messengers, for it was upon his advice that the bridge had been built and it was his policy for the King's forces to go forth openly to war, and sent them away.<ref name=""Narn"" /><ref name=""Turin"" /><ref name=""Fall"">{{CH|11}}</ref>

This would prove to be a fatal mistake, since in {{FA|495}},<ref name=""GAS275"" /> Morgoth unleashed his forces at Nargothrond. Led by [[Glaurung]] the dragon, they devastated the army of Orodreth at the [[Battle of Tumhalad]]. In that battle Orodreth was slain, and after that the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] was inevitable, due to the bridge that allowed Glaurung and Morgoth's host to ravage the city, and most of its people were either enslaved or killed (including Orodreth's daughter Finduilas).<ref name=""Narn"" /><ref name=""Turin"" /><ref name=""Fall"" />

==Etymology==
''Orodreth'' translates to ""mountaineer"".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, root '''RETE''', p. 182</ref> Paul Strack suggests that it is a combination of ''[[ered|orod]]'' (""mountain"") and ''reth'' (""climber"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2927154629.html|articlename=S. ''Orodreth'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=19 October 2022}}</ref>

His Quenya name was '''''Artaresto''''' (''arta'' (""noble""); ''resto'' may be derived from √RETH (“endurance”)<ref group=""note"">See [https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2018176983.html?neo Eldamo] for details</ref>) which Sindarized to '''''Rodreth''''' and was further altered to ''Orodreth'' because of his love of the mountains.<ref name=""Galad"" />

== Other names ==
In '' Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names'', he is called '''Ordred''';<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> while [[Christopher Tolkien]] does not provide a translation, it could mean ""spear council"" (""ord"" meaning ""spear"",<ref>[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxondictio00tolluoft/page/676/mode/1up ''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary : based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth. Supplement'', pg. 676]</ref> and ""rǣd"", commonly shortened to ""red"", meaning council<ref>[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxondictio00tolluoft/page/683/mode/1up ''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary : based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
=== Decline  into weakness and insignificance ===
As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]], in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', Orodreth goes through a steady decline as the legendarium evolved.
{{quote|In the poem, on the other hand, Orodreth emerges as hostile and formidable, and his character is carefully outlined: he is quick to anger (1973) but his wrath is cold and long-enduring (2133–4), he is seldom moved to pity (1969, 2134), grim-hearted and deep-counselled (2132–3), but capable of deep love (1970) as also of fierce hate (2135). Afterwards, as the legends developed, Orodreth underwent a steady decline into weakness and insignificance, which is very curious. Many years later, when meditating the development of the Túrin saga, my father noted that Orodreth was ‘rather a weak character’; cf. the Narn, p. 160: ‘he turned as he ever did to Túrin for counsel’. Ultimately he was to be displaced as the second King of Nargothrond (Unfinished Tales p. 255, note 20). But all this is a far cry from the hard and grim king in his underground hall depicted in the poem; Felagund had not yet emerged, nor the rebellious power of Celegorm and Curufin in Nargothrond (see further p. 246).|{{LB|1d}}}}

===Early legendarium===
In earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], Orodreth was a more important character, and the original king of Nargothrond. However, his importance diminished over time. 

In one of the early versions, he had two sons whose names were translated as [[Ordhelm]] and [[Ordláf]] in [[Old English]] by [[Ælfwine]], though the original [[Elvish]] names were lost to time.<ref name=""Ord"">{{SM|QA1}}, p. 213</ref> In another version, his two sons were [[Haldir (son of Orodreth)|Haldir]] [< Halmir] who was slain after being trapped by Orcs and hung on a tree,<ref>{{LR|AB}}</ref>{{rp|112}} and a younger son [[Orodlin (son of Orodreth)|Orodlin]].<ref>{{LR|A1}}</ref>{{rp|309}}

===Parentage and children===
In the published versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' Orodreth is the son of [[Finarfin]] and younger brother of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]].<ref name=""Flight"" /><ref name=""Beleriand"" /><ref name=""Beren"" /><ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref><ref>{{UT|2o}}, much fuller account of the coming of the Elves Gelmir and Arminas to Nargothrond</ref>

In J.R.R. Tolkien's updates to the genealogical tables of the descendants of Finwë, dating between 1959-1968, Orodreth's lineage went through several revisions. First, while named as ''Artanáro Rhodothir'', he was changed to be son of Finrod Felegund. When Tolkien apparently recalled that Finrod had no wife or son, Orodreth was then made the son of Finrod's brother, Angrod. Orodreth's name was then changed from ''Artanáro'' to ''Artaresto''. Finally, in a note dated August 1965, Tolkien fully elaborated on both Orodreth (''Artaresto'') being the son of Angrod, and Gil-galad (''Artanáro'') in turn being the son of Orodreth.<ref name=""Galad"" />

[[Christopher Tolkien]] did not incorporate these changes into the published materials, but he did make several comments on them. ''""For a reason unknown to me, my father displaced the second King of Nargothrond and made him a member of the same family in the next generation; but this and associated genealogical changes were never incorporated in the narratives of The Silmarillion.""''<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 255 note 20</ref> ''""There can be no doubt that this was my father’s last word on the subject; but nothing of this late and radically altered conception ever touched the existing narratives, and it was obviously impossible to introduce it into the published Silmarillion. It would nonetheless have been very much better to have left Gil-galad’s parentage obscure.""''<ref name=""Galad"" />

===A note from ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''===
However, in a very late note dated c. 1972-3, the name ''Orodreth'' is again mentioned in the list of some renowned heroes in the royal lines of old, so it seems that Tolkien abandoned the name ''Arothir'' (which was itself meant to replace ''Orodreth'' a few years earlier).<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote, p. 189</ref>

'''Mablung''' was an [[Iathrim|Elf of Doriath]] and the chief captain of [[Thingol]].<ref name=""Beren""/>

He was chiefly remembered in legend for his role in the [[Hunting of the Wolf|the hunt for Carcharoth]], where he retrieved the [[Silmaril]] from [[Carcharoth|the Wolf]]'s belly. He also played a tragic role in many events related to [[Túrin]] such as the altercations between Túrin and [[Saeros]], led the guard of [[Morwen]] and [[Nienor]] before they were lost, and confirmed the identity of Nienor to Túrin before his suicide.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Mablung is first mentioned at his attendance of the [[Mereth Aderthad]] in {{FA|20}}, with he and [[Daeron]] being the only two messengers bringing the greetings of Thingol.<ref>{{GA|72}}</ref>

=== Hunting of the Wolf ===
In {{FA|466}},<ref>{{GA|186}}</ref> during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], Thingol learned that his daughter, [[Lúthien]], was being held in [[Nargothrond]] after receiving an embassy sent by [[Celegorm]] declaring that he would wed her. Thinking to make war on Nargothrond to retrieve her, Thingol sent out spies and further learned that Celegorm and [[Curufin]] had since been driven from Nargothrond, but Lúthien had fled and was now missing. Thingol then sent messengers, including Mablung, to [[Himring]] to summon the aid of the [[House of Fëanor]] in seeking for her, since it was by their doing she had become lost. These messengers did not complete their task however, as they unexpectedly encountered Carcharoth; the wolf had consumed a Silmaril and, maddened with pain, burst into [[Doriath]] unhindered by the [[Girdle of Melian]]. Alone of the messengers Mablung escaped and brought the dread tidings to Thingol.<ref name=""Beren"" />

At nearly the same time [[Beren]] and Lúthien returned, and shared their story, including how Carcharoth came to consume the Silmaril after biting off Beren's hand. Shortly after, with Carcharoth continuing to rampage and daily drawing closer to [[Menegroth]], Thingol organized a great Hunting of the Wolf, accompanied by Mablung, Beren, [[Beleg]], and [[Huan]]. During the hunt Carcharoth came upon Thingol and Beren, and was slain, but slew Huan and mortally wounded Beren in turn.<ref name=""Beren"" />

Mablung and Beleg then hastened to the King's aid, but in seeing what had been done cast aside their spears and wept. Mablung then cut open the Wolf's belly and found that while Carcharoth's innards had been consumed as though by fire, the hand of Beren still held the Silmaril and remained incorrupt.<ref name=""Beren"" />  Mablung attempted to retrieve them, but so great seemed their weight that Mablung's own hand was dragged downward and forced open, letting Beren's hand fall to the ground.<ref name=""SMQ13"">{{SM|Q13}}</ref> Beren's hand was then no more, leaving the Silmaril unveiled and filing the forest with its light. Quickly, and in fear, Mablung placed the Silmaril in Beren's remaining hand, with its touch rousing him enough to bid Thingol to receive it.<ref name=""Beren"" /> 

Mablung then helped bear the bodies of Beren and Huan back to Menegroth.<ref name=""Beren"" /> 

=== Battle of Unnumbered Tears ===
Unwilling to have no part in the battle, Thingol gave leave to Mablung to join the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|great assault on Morgoth]] so long as he did not serve the House of the Fëanor; as such he joined himself to the host of [[Fingon]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> At this battle Mablung saved three of the [[Haladin]] who fought under [[Haldir (Chieftain of Brethil)|Haldir]], and healed them of their wounds.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>

=== The death of Saeros ===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Saeros' Fatal Leap 2.jpg|left|thumb|""Saeros' Fatal Leap"" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Mablung became entwined in the Doom of [[Húrin]]'s children when he interceded in a confrontation between [[Túrin]] and [[Saeros]] (a counselor to the King) in [[Thingol|Thingol's]] hall. Mablung's wise warning to Saeros to stay clear of him after he was injured and almost run through for his taunting of Túrin fell on deaf and prideful ears. The following day Saeros waylaid Túrin as he traveled through the woods back to the marches to continue his personal war against the Shadow. Mablung was not privy to the sneak attack Saeros executed, nor to his swift defeat at the hands of Túrin. 

Mablung was among a group that was alerted by Saeros' frantic calls as Túrin pursued the now disarmed and stripped elf through the woods (revenge for the taunting Saeros had delivered the night before). Such was Saeros' fear, as he meant to kill Túrin and was certain this was to be returned in kind, that he fled wildly through the woods with Túrin ever behind him. 

Only the swiftest could keep up with Túrin, and Mablung was at the forefront of these. Mablung called at Túrin to stop the ""Orc-work,"" but Túrin called back it was only ""Orc-play"" and was spurned on in his pursuit by Mablung's discourse. Soon after, Saeros attempted to escape his relentless pursuer by leaping across a stream, but instead lost his footing and fell to his death. Turin, who had meant to stop his pursuit at the river, turned and faced his pursuers and, in his pride, refused to defend his actions. Instead, he rejected the King's justice and gave the witnesses the choice of letting him go or slaying him. As their number were too few to take Túrin alive, Mablung let the young man go with a warning that if he were to leave this way a shadow would be over him.

At Túrin's hearing before the King, Mablung defended Túrin for the confrontation in the hall but could give no reason for his hounding of the King's councilor to his death. Beleg, Túrin's greatest friend and brother-in-arms, brought forward a witness who saw Saeros' treacherous attack and thus saved Túrin from the King's doom. Mablung, having heard the full story, expressed his sorrow at his parting words to Túrin.

=== The guarding of Morwen and hunt for Nienor ===
Mablung was in charge to guard [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]], who had dwelt in Doriath at the time, when she set out to Nargothrond in search of her son [[Túrin Turambar]]. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen, [[Nienor]] daughter of Morwen, had joined them.

The women were left back upon [[Amon Ethir]] and Mablung set out with a small company to scout Nargothrond as were his orders by Thingol. Yet [[Glaurung]] left Nargothrond and Mablung was unable to prevent them both from getting ensnared in the traps of the [[Dragon]]. He hid from Glaurung and then searched the sacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin. Glaurung when returning mocked Mablung, sparing his life, and informing him that he had now lost also Morwen and Nienor.

Eventually Mablung did find Nienor, enchanted by Glaurung, only to lose her again during an attack by [[Orc-hunters]]. Defeated, Mablung returned to Doriath and due to his failure at Nargothrond he asked Thingol to dismiss him. Thingol judged that the failure hardly was Mablung's fault and that Glaurung was too mighty an enemy for him and kept Mablung in his position. Nevertheless, he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen and Nienor.<ref>{{CH|14}}</ref>

Learning that Glaurung was in the [[Forest of Brethil]], Mablung went there, and met Túrin who had just slain the dragon. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to realize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor. As a consequence, Túrin ran off and Mablung found him shortly after fallen upon his own [[Gurthang|sword]].<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>

=== Later deeds ===
In {{FA|503}}, during the [[battle in the Thousand Caves|attack on Doriath]] by the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]], Mablung fell<ref group=note>Note that Tolkien has used ""fell"" in meaning of ""brought down suddenly or violently"". Cf. ""[[He chanted a song of wizardry,|And Finrod fell before the throne]]"".</ref> in front of the treasury where the [[Nauglamír]] was kept.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref><ref group=note>Mablung's involvement in the battle against the Dwarves is not attested in the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' beyond that provided in the ''[[Book of Lost Tales]]''. In ''[[Arda Reconstructed: The Creation of the Published Silmarillion]]'', [[Douglas Charles Kane]] states that the invasion of Menegroth including this detail was ""the version created by Christopher for the published Silmarillion"".</ref>

Sometime later, Mablung was cited as being one of the chief sources of information for the poet [[Dírhaval]] who lived in the [[Havens of Sirion]] in the days of [[Eärendil]].<ref>{{WJ|II}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Mablung'' is translated as ""with weighted hand"". The name might either have been [[foresight|prophetic]] or given as a title after the cutting of the Silmaril.<ref name=""VT47"">{{VT|47a}}, pp. 8, 19 (note 11)</ref><ref name=""SMQ13"" /> The name is analyzed as [[Doriathrin]], with ''[[mab]]'' ""hand"" and ''[[lung]]'' ""heavy"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> He is also referred as ""Mablung of the Heavy Hand"", with his epithet being the translation of his name.<ref>{{S|19}}; {{S|22}}; {{S|Index}}</ref>

The [[Quenya]] equivalent of ''Mablung'' appears to have been '''''Lungumá''''' or '''''Lungumaqua''''' (""Heavyhand""), containing the element ''[[má]]'' (""hand"").<ref name=""VT47"" />

== Other names and titles ==
He is variously referred to as Thingol's chief warrior<ref>{{LB|3U}}</ref>, ""Mablung the Hunter""<ref>{{UT|2d}}</ref>, and the chief huntsman of Thingol.<ref>{{UT|2m}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== The Book of Lost Tales ===
Mablung is first introduced in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' as the chief of the king’s thanes during the Hunting of the Wolf. Armed with a spear previously captured in battle with the Orcs, he joined King ''Tinwelint'' (Thingol), Beren, and Huan. After Karkaras was slain, Mablung retrieved the Silmaril and offered it to Tinwelint, but the King refused it, stating he would not handle it unless given by Beren. As Beren had been sorely wounded by Karkaras, Mablung and Tinwelint bore him back to Tinwelint's halls where Beren briefly awoke. Beren received the Silmaril from Mablung and gave it to Tinwelint.<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>

The character of Mablung was an emendation from ''Tingfang'' (son of Tinwelint), who was originally a member of the hunt. As this passage was written after [[Tinfang]] was already stated as becoming lost, [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|his father]], noticing the contradiction, then created Mablung as Tingfang's replacement.<ref>{{LT2|In}}</ref>{{rp|note 12}}

In one version of ''[[The History of the Exiled Gnomes]]'' ""Mablon the [[Ilkorindi|Ilkorin]]"" perished serving in the rearguard of [[Turgon]] during his retreat from the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, standing against a ""host of [[Balrogs]]"".<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>

Mablung next appears in ''[[The Nauglafring]]'' where he and Huan joined Tinwelint on a commemorative hunt celebrating the anniversary of the slaying of Karkaras. Initially Tinwelint did not recognize Mablung for the wild growth of his hair, but was soon glad to have him, and Mablung rode beside the king in honour of his deeds at the original great hunt. While Tinwelint's company was resting in mirth and laughter, they were suddenly and unexpectedly encircled by armed Dwarves. They fought bitterly, but eventually Tinwelint and his folks were all slain, with Mablung and the King falling side by side. The Dwarf King, [[Naugladur]], then took Tinwelint's head, only daring to do so after they were dead, as he would not otherwise be so near Tinwelint's sword or Mablung's axe.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

=== Other ===
In the essay ""''Eldarin Hands, Fingers & Numerals'' and Related Writings"", Mablung is said to have been the one to slay Carcharoth after Beren was mortally wounded.<ref>{{VT|47a}}</ref>

'''Quickbeam''', or in [[Sindarin]] '''Bregalad''', was one of the younger [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] belonging to the people of [[Skinbark]]. His name was given because of his uncharacteristic hastiness.  
==History==
The [[rowans|rowan]]-trees in his keeping (among them [[Carnimírië]], [[Lassemista]], and [[Orofarnë]]) suffered greatly at the hands of [[Saruman]]'s [[Orcs]], so he was the first ent to make his mind up at the [[Entmoot]]. He sheltered, in his [[Ent-houses|home]], the two [[hobbits]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while the other ents made up their minds at the Entmoot.<ref name=tt482/> He played a great part in the Ents' resulting [[Battle of Isengard|attack]] on [[Isengard]] and stopped Saruman when he tried to escape.<ref name=Flotsam>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 568</ref> He was among the Ents guarding Orthanc after the Battle of Isengard.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 980</ref>
==Characteristics==
Quickbeam was considered very hasty or at least ""nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent"" according to Treebeard. Part of this hastiness was because he had seen first-hand the actions of Saruman as his home was ravaged by Orcs. Despite this, he was joyous, singing as he walked and laughing easily.<ref name=tt482/> He was described by Pippin as gentle but with a fierce hatred towards Saruman for his actions towards his people.<ref name=Flotsam/>

Quickbeam appeared to be one of the younger ents. His hair was smooth, his lips ruddy and his hair green. He was tall but could bend and sway in the wind like a slender tree. His voice was resonant and higher and clearer than Treebeard's.<ref name=tt482>{{TT|Treebeard}}, pp. 482-4</ref>
== Etymology ==
The name ''Quickbeam'' was given to him because he was hasty for an Ent.<ref name=tt482/> His Sindarin name, ''Bregalad'', means ""quick (lively) tree"", derived from  *''[[BERÉK|breg]]-'' having to do with ""violence, suddenness"" and ''[[galadh]]'', ""tree"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 82</ref>

Quickbeam (Old English ''Cwicbeám'') and Quicken are actual English names of the [[Rowans|rowan]] or mountain [[Ashes|ash]], ''Sorbus aucuparia.'' It was not coincidental that ""rowan"" is mentioned in Quickbeam's song.<ref name=""nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 762</ref>

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:[https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/lotr06033 A card] in [[Decipher]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]] identifies one of the Ents at [[Isengard]] as Quickbeam.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Quickbeam is first met in a grove onen the far eastern side of [[Nan Curunír]], attempting to put an end to Saruman's attacks on the forest on his own. Shortly after the Ents take Isengard, Quickbeam returns to [[Derndingle]], where he gives the player tasks to pacify the forest that had quickly become wild in the absence of the Ents.

'''Elendil''' was the father of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], a survivor of the [[Downfall of Númenor]], and the founder and first [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] of the [[Realms in Exile]]. 

Elendil was also known as '''Elendil the Tall''', as he was the tallest of the Men who escaped the Downfall. Accounts differ as to his exact height, but he was at least seven feet tall.<ref name=linear/><ref name=tallnote>{{HM|RC}}, p. 272 citing from a note written by J.R.R. Tolkien approximately in the year 1969</ref>

==History==
Elendil was born in [[Númenor]]. He was the son of [[Amandil]], the last [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] and leader of the [[Faithful]]. He was probably named after his ancestor, [[Tar-Elendil]], an ancient [[King of Númenor]]; his name also signified his and his family's devotion and friendship to the [[Elves]] as [[Elf-friend]]s, preserving the old beliefs in [[Ilúvatar]] and reverence for the [[Valar]]. Like his father, he stood against the barbarous practices of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] the King and [[Sauron]] his advisor. 
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Elendil and Sons.jpg|thumb|left|Abe Papakhian - ''Elendil and Sons'']]
On the advice of his father, who foresaw the coming destruction of Númenor, Elendil put nine ships off the eastern coast and loaded all his people and possessions aboard them. Amandil then followed the actions of their ancestor, [[Eärendil]] and left Númenor attempting to warn the Valar of their King's folly.<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

When the catastrophic [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] occurred in {{SA|3319}}, Elendil, his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], and their supporters fled to [[Middle-earth]],<ref name=""SA"">{{App|SA}}</ref> sailing east in the nine ships. With them they took the ''[[palantíri]]'', the ""Seeing Stones"" that were given to the Lords of Andúnië by the Elves of [[Tol Eressëa]], the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], the [[Ring of Barahir]], [[Narsil]] which Elendil kept as his sword, and a seedling of [[White Tree of Númenor|Nimloth]], the White Tree of Númenor.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Ships of the Faithful.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Ships of the Faithful'']]
The ships became separated during the tumultuous voyage to Middle-earth; while Isildur and Anárion landed in the more southerly lands near the haven of the Faithful at [[Pelargir]], Elendil and his people arrived at the northwest near [[Lindon]].<ref name=""Rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref> After Elendil finally landed in Middle-earth, he proclaimed an [[Elendil's Oath|oath]] in [[Quenya]]: ""''Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta''"" (""Out of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world""). His heir and great-grandson by 39 generations [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] spoke these words again when he took up the crown of Gondor as King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] at the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

The Faithful colonists of Middle-earth, and other [[Middle Men]], gathered around the Númenórean lords at the points they arrived; for this reason there were two realms of the Númenóreans in exile, [[Arnor]] in the north where Elendil landed, and [[Gondor]] in the south where his sons ended up.<ref name=""Rings"" /> Elendil founded the city of [[Annúminas]] in [[Eriador]], the capital of Arnor. His son Anárion established the city of [[Minas Anor]] in [[Anórien]], and Isildur founded [[Minas Ithil]] in [[Ithilien]]. Elendil, however, ruled as [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]]. In both realms were built towers for the ''palantíri'', with which the lords kept contact.<ref name=""Rings""/>

Gil-galad built for Elendil the [[White Towers]] on some [[Emyn Beraid|hills]] of Eriador. In the [[Elostirion|tallest tower]] he kept a unique ''palantír'', the [[Stone of Elendil]] that could not communicate with the other six, because it was aligned westwards towards the [[Master-stone]] in the [[Tower of Avallonë]]. Elendil was able to use it to look west across the [[Belegaer|Sea]] and see the [[Undying Lands]];<ref name=""Rings""/> but he could not see Númenor for it was covered by the bent seas for ever.<ref name=App>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedue, footnote about the ''palantíri'', p. 1042</ref>
===Sauron's return and Last Alliance===
[[Sauron]], having lost his shape in the Downfall, returned to Middle-earth as a shadow and a black wind over the sea. It came to [[Mordor]], next to Gondor, where Sauron wrought a new guise.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/> In {{SA|3429}} Sauron attacked, seizing Minas Ithil, causing Isildur to flee north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of Gondor. In response, Elendil formed an [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|alliance]] with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to repel Sauron's assault.<ref name=""SA""/> It is said that Elendil bound the [[Last Alliance]] with an oath and invoked the name of [[Eru]] to witness it.<ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

The combined forces marched east to [[Imladris]] in {{SA|3431}}. In {{SA|3434|n}}, they passed the [[Misty Mountains]] and south together and fought in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] of Elves and Men. Elendil fought valiantly at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]].<ref name=""SA""/>
[[File:Abe Papakhian - I Behold (colour).jpg|thumb|left|Abe Papakhian ''I Behold'']]
At the end of the long [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], in the year {{SA|3441}}, Sauron came out to personally do battle. Gil-galad and Elendil fought Sauron and cast him down, but were both slain,<ref name=""SA""/> and Elendil's sword [[Narsil]] was broken when he fell. Isildur used the broken sword to cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. However, despite the urgings of [[Elrond]] and [[Cirdan]], Isildur chose not to destroy the Ring at [[Mount Doom]] and was eventually betrayed by the Ring in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], slain by [[Orcs]].<ref name=""Rings""/>

==Legacy==
Elendil was a great warrior, a wise king, and a heroic figure among the [[Dúnedain]]. Isildur built a hidden [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb for his father]] on the summit of the beacon hill that was named [[Amon Anwar]] (""hill of awe"" in [[Sindarin]]). Its presence was considered great enough to hallow the entire hill, even to the [[Rohirrim]], who called it Halifirien (""holy mountain"" in [[Rohanese]]).<ref name=""Cirion"">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

After the founding of [[Rohan]], the [[Steward]] [[Cirion]] moved Elendil's remains to the [[Hallows]] of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=""Cirion""/>

Millennia after Elendil's death, [[Aragorn]], the [[Heir of Isildur]], invoked the name of Elendil as a battle cry during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{HM|FR}} passim.</ref><ref>{{HM|TT}} passim.</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Elendil.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Elendil'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Lover of the Stars"".<ref name=QEnote10>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 10, p. 410</ref>

For the [[Edain]] it was intended to signify ""[[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]]"", (''[[Nimruzîrim|Nimruzîr]] in [[Adûnaic]] ''),<ref>{{SD|67}}, p. 247</ref> since they tended to confuse the Quenya element [[EL]] for both ""Elf"" and ""star"".<ref name=QEnote10/>

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:In the film's prologue, Elendil is played by [[Peter McKenzie]]. Unlike in the books, Elendil is killed by a blow of [[Sauron]] instead of having a part in destroying him with [[Gil-galad]]. Instead, [[Isildur]] deals the fatal blow to the still-living Sauron by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of [[Narsil]], and, with them, the [[The One Ring|ring of power]].

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)]]'':'''
:Elendil appears in the game's first level as a non-playable character, where he has the likeness of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|movie counterpart]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Elendil appears in several flashbacks depicting the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than the film version, showing Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] both battling and defeating [[Sauron]] at the cost of their lives, with Elendil dealing the killing blow.

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''
:Elendil is portrayed by [[Lloyd Owen]] as a captain. He first appears in the [[Adar (episode)|third episode]], in a plotline created for the series in which he rescues [[Galadriel]] and [[Halbrand]] from the sea and takes them to [[Númenor]]. Unlike in the source materials, his Númenórean nobility is uncertain, as he is unknown to [[Tar-Míriel|Queen Míriel]].

== History ==
Following the march of the [[Elves]] of [[Kôr]] to the [[Great Lands]] to free the enslaved [[Gnomes]], the remaining Elves waged a war with evil Men, and afterwards retreated to the land of [[Luthany]] ruled by Ing, who was friendly to them.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''18''', pp. 302-3</ref>

After some time, [[Eärendel]], fleeing from [[Ossë]], came to Luthany and was given aid by Ing. In return for his help, Eärendel allowed Ing to drink ''[[limpë]]'', which made him immortal.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''23''', p. 306</ref><ref group=""note"">In another outline, it was the Elves living in Luthany who gave Ing ''limpë'', with Eärendel coming to Luthany after the invasion of the [[Rúmhoth]] has already taken place.</ref> Eärendel also spoke to him of [[Tol Eressëa]], where many of the Elves of Luthany moved to. This inspired Ing, ""longing for the Elves"", to try to sail there; however, due to the anger of Ossë for helping Eärendel, he and all his fleet were driven east, and only Ing managed to survive.<ref name=""Ang""/>

There, he became the king of the people known as the [[Ingwaiwar]] (named after him). He instructed them in many things, including the [[Valar]] and the Elves, and set their hearts toward sailing west.<ref name=""Ang""/>

At some point, Ing left the Ingwaiwar, departing in a boat, and was never heard of again.<ref name=""Ang""/><ref group=""note"">In another note, he went to, and reached Tol Eressëa. There, it is said that one day he would [[Faring Forth|lead the Elves of Tol Eressëa back to Luthany]].</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''22''', pp. 305-6</ref>

His people, the Ingwaiwar, eventually conquered Luthany and became known as the [[wikipedia:English people|English]]. However, unlike all other previous invaders, they were friendly to the Elves owing to the teachings of Ing.<ref name=""Jut""/><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outlines '''20''' and '''21''', p. 304</ref>

Among Ing's descendants was [[Ælfwine]] the Mariner, who travelled to Tol Eressëa, and learned the histories of the Elves.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 309</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Ing'' is of unknown origin. Another name for the character was ''Ingwë''.

''Ing'' was also an earlier, rejected ([[Qenya]]) name for the character of [[Inwë]], the leader of the [[Vanyar|Teleri]] in ''The Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 22</ref>

In the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'', from c. [[1926]], the name ''Ing'' is described as being the Gnomish form of ''[[Ingwë]]'', as opposed to the earlier conception of ''Ing'' being a rejected Qenya form of ''Inwë''.<ref>{{SM|2a}}, p. 44</ref>

== Inspiration ==
The main inspiration behind the character was the figure of ''[[Wikipedia:Yngvi|Ing]]'' in the ''[[wikipedia:Old English rune poem|Runic Poem]]'', of whom it is said: ""Ing was first seen by men among the [[wikipedia:Geats|East Danes]], until he departed eastwards over the waves; his car sped after him.""<ref name=""Jut""/>

The [[Ingwaiwar]], his followers, were probably based on the people called the ''[[wikipedia:Ingaevones|Inguaeones]]'', the ancestors of the English.<ref name=""Jut""/>

'''Gildor Inglorion''' was a [[Noldor]]in [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[House of Finrod]], who was one of the few [[Exiled Noldor]] in the late [[Third Age]].

==History==
Gildor was probably the son of some [[Inglor]] and one of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]] of the House of Finrod.<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 80</ref> He lived in or near Rivendell.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, pp. 65-66</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Feasting with the Elves.jpg|thumb|left|''Feasting with the Elves'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Elven [[Wandering Companies]] crossed [[the Shire]] and Gildor knew well [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] when they were out in the woods. Around [[September]] {{TA|3001}}, as [[Bilbo Baggins]] was leaving the Shire for Rivendell, Gildor met the [[hobbit]] as he waved them farewell in one of their camps above [[Woodhall]]. The following years he met him once more,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 83</ref> perhaps at Rivendell.
===Meeting Frodo===
{{quote|Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill.|Gildor Inglorion}}
In September {{TA|3018}}, he led a Wandering Company of [[Elves]] of [[Rivendell]] travelling eastwards from the [[Emyn Beraid]], where they went to see [[Varda|Elbereth]] in the ''[[Elostirion-stone|palantír]]'' that was kept there. On the [[24 September|24th]], they were [[Elven Hymn to Elbereth|singing]], and unknown to him their sounds drove away a [[Black Riders|Black Rider]] who was searching for [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]] on the road near the [[Woody End]]. As they passed by them, Gildor was the hindmost, and seeing Frodo he greeted him, to his surprise. Gildor initially intended that the elves bid the [[hobbits]] farewell and continue on their way, until Pippin spoke of the Black Riders pursuing them. Upon hearing this, he invited the hobbits to join them, although it was not their custom. He rejoiced after hearing Frodo's [[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo|Quenya greeting]] and gave him the title [[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]].<ref name=""3IC"">{{FR|Three}}, pp. 80-5</ref>

At night they camped on a hill above [[Woodhall]]; they ate and sang, and Gildor discussed the peril that haunted the three hobbits. He sensed Frodo's fears and uncertainties about his travel to Rivendell, and was worried hearing that [[Gandalf]] had not returned as he had promised to Frodo. When Frodo asked whether he ought to wait for Gandalf, Gildor replied that the choice was Frodo's, but if he demanded counsel, then Gildor advised him not to wait but to follow Gandalf's plans, with trusty companions. However, he refused to tell him more of the nature of the mysterious Black Riders, except that they were agents of the [[Sauron|Enemy]], and deadly.<ref name=""3IC""/>

After separating from the hobbits, he informed other [[Wandering Companies]] to be on the watch,<ref name=""3IC""/> and sent word to the house of [[Tom Bombadil]], probably before the [[26 September|26th]].<ref>{{FR|Bombadil}}, p. 132</ref> He also spoke with [[Aragorn]]<ref>{{FR|Strider}}, p. 172</ref> and sent a message to [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 210</ref>

Two years later, on [[22 September]] {{TA|3021}}, he met the hobbits once again. He accompanied a riding of great Lords and Ladies, that planned to sail [[Aman|West]] on board the [[White Ship]]<ref>{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1028</ref> and probably he was among the Elves who sailed to the West.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry ""Gildor Inglorion""</ref><ref group=note>The narrative does not specify whether Gildor also boarded the ship to the West or if he was simply present as a companion.</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Gildor'' is not given, but it can be deduced as [[Sindarin]] ""Star Lord"", from [[gil]] (""star"") and -dor (""lord, king"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-879448255.html|articlename=S. ''Gildor'' m.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=15 December 2019}}</ref>

The same applies to ''Inglorion'', which means ""Son of Inglor"", from ''[[-ion]]'' (""son of""),<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-4136402505.html|articlename=S. ''Inglorion'' m.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 August 2024}}</ref> leading to the genealogical discussion explained below.

==Ancestry==
Gildor is one of the less prominently featured Elves, yet he seems important enough to raise questions concerning his lineage, or the identity of this character. Gildor calls himself ""Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod"". He also says: ""''We are [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]], and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].''""<ref name=""3IC""/> 
 
It should be noted that Tolkien initially used names from his (unpublished) ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' writings rather at random in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first drafts of the sequel which would become ''The Lord of the Rings'': other examples are the mention of [[Gondolin]] and the appearance of [[Elrond]] in ''The Hobbit'', which were only later brought into alignment with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the unpublished mythology by a third edition of the book.<ref name=""L257"">{{L|257}}</ref> This may be the case of the reference to the name ""Finrod"".

The name ""Gildor"" first appeared in the outlines of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in February [[1938]],<ref>{{RS|Hobbiton}} (p. 45)</ref> and in Tolkien's notes of that time, ""Finrod"" still meant the character later known as [[Finarfin]]<ref name=""RC3IC"">{{HM|RC}}, ""[[Three is Company]]"", pp. 103-4</ref> and [[Finrod|his son]] had the older name ""[[Inglor]]"".

However the name ''[[Inglor]]'' reappeared, in [[Quenya]] form, for Finarfin (who in the earlier legendarium, was named Finrod). Finarfin's [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Ingalaurë]]''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 30</ref> If Ingalaurë is to be translated in [[Sindarin]] according to the [[Sindarization|sound-changing rules]], this would become ''Inglor''. Thus, the connection of Gildor to the house of Finrod/Finarfin still remains in the updated legendarium.

This all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he may have been a member of the House of Finrod as some other descendant, or servant, not one of Finrod's sons — perhaps one of the knights of [[Nargothrond]].

It is also possible that he was a son of a supposed ""Inglor"" — a character unconnected to Finrod Felagund.

{{quote|He is a warrior, Andreth, and a spirit of wrath. In every stroke that he deals he sees the Enemy who long ago did thee [[Fall of Men|this hurt]].|[[Finrod]] about Aegnor in ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''}}

'''Aegnor''' was a son of [[Finarfin]] and a lord of the [[Noldor]]. He was terrible to endure in battle and a fire burned in his eyes. His golden hair was stiff and straight. Aegnor's spirit burned relentless, even at a young age, but he was also thought of as generous and noble among the [[Firstborn]].<ref name=""Aikanaro"" />

==History==
===Early history===
Aegnor was the elder brother of [[Galadriel]] and the younger brother of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and [[Angrod]].<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> He had a strong friendship with [[Fingon]] and grace to him, and he followed the Exiles under the host of [[Fingolfin]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> 

As vassals of Finrod, he and Angrod held the highlands of [[Dorthonion]] against [[Morgoth]] during the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> But, like Finrod, he had no trust that the Siege would hold Morgoth for long.<ref name=""Athrabeth"">{{MR|P4c}}</ref>{{rp|434}}

In the time following the alliance of the [[Edain]] with the Elves, who had themselves become numerous and strong, [[Fingolfin]] pondered an assault upon Angband. Aegnor and Angrod, dwelling in regions where [[Thangorodrim]] could be descried, were alone among the chieftains of the Noldor who were of like mind; with most of the other Noldor being content with things as they were, trusting them to last, and slow to begin an assault in which many must surely perish. Thus, the designs of Fingolfin came to naught.<ref name=""fingolfin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

===Love with Andreth===
While in Dorthonion, Aegnor fell in love with the [[Man|human]] woman, [[Andreth]], but from this he turned away. 

The Elves considered it a grievous thing if a wedded pair were sundered during the bearing of a child, or while the first years of childhood lasted, and therefore they customarily avoid wedding or begetting children during times of war. The Eldar also recognized that any marriage between Elves and Men, being brief and hard, with the least cruel fate being that death would soon end it, shall only be for some high purpose of Doom.

While Aegnor's heart wished to take Andreth and flee far away, this would have forsaken his kin, to which love and loyalty held him to. Were they wed, then, as she grew old, he would have stayed at her side to uphold her, and she would have thus had in every hour pity inescapable, and he would not have her so shamed.

As the life and love of the Eldar dwelled much in memory, they would rather have a memory that is fair but unfinished than one that goes on to a grievous end. As such, Aegnor would ever remember her in the sun of morning, and that last evening by the water of [[Aeluin]] in which he saw her face mirrored with a star caught in her hair.

For her sake he would never take the hand of any bride from his own kindred, but live alone to the end; and even after death, forever remain in the [[Halls of Waiting]] until the end of Arda.<ref name=""Athrabeth"">{{MR|P4c}}</ref>

===Death===
Aegnor and Angrod were both slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref name=""fingolfin"" />

==Etymology==
''Aegnor'' was the [[Sindarin]] version of ''Aikanáro'', although it was not true Sindarin, as there was no equivalent to ''aica'', which would take the form ''aeg''.<ref name=""Aikanaro"">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 347</ref> However, both ''Aegnor'' and ''Aikanáro'' are glossed as ""Sharp-flame"" at some point,<ref name=""Athrabeth"" /> so ''Aegnor'' could easily be a combination of ''[[aeg]]'' (""sharp"") + the suffixal form of ''[[naur]]'' (""fire"").

==Other names==
The original name of Aegnor was '''''Aikanáro''''', his [[Quenya]] [[mother-name]], meaning ""Fell Fire"", from ''[[aika]]'' (""fell"", ""terrible"", ""dire"") + ''[[Nár (Quenya)|nár]]'' (""fire"") + ''-o'' (pronominal suffix). This was in part a prophetic name, as he was one of the most valiant warriors, with fire in his eyes.<ref name=""Aikanaro"" /> If directly translated into Sindarin, ''Aikanáro'' would have been rendered as ''Goenor'', using the noun ''goe'' (""terror, great fear"").<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 363, note 45</ref>

His [[Quenya]] [[father-name]] was '''''Ambaráto'''''. It seems to mean ""High Champion"" and to be a compound of ''[[amba]]'' (""up"") and ''[[aráto]]'' (""champion"").<ref name=""Eldamo"">{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2175363371.html|articlename=Q. ''Ambaráto'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=01 March 2024}}</ref> Its Sindarin version would have been ''[[Amrod]]'', but to distinguish himself from the other Noldo [[Angrod]] and because he preferred it, he used his mother-name.<ref name=""Aikanaro"" />

In '' Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names'', he is called '''Eangrim'''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> ""Ean"" is not uncommon as an element in Old English and Germanic names, but the etymology is unknown.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_name Germanic names]</ref> ""Grim"" translates into meanings such as ""fierce"", ""terrible"", ""cruel"", ""savage"", ""violent"", ""deadly"", or ""severe"".<ref>''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary : based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In such early writings as ''[[The Lost Tales]]'' and ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the precursor of Aegnor was called '''''[[Egnor (disambiguation)|Egnor]]''''', and he was one of the sons of Finrod (later Finarfin) who fell during the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref>{{LB|3}}, ''passim''</ref><ref>{{HM|SM}}, ''passim''</ref> The variation ''Eignor'' is also encountered in some texts.<ref>{{NM|P2x}}, p. 222</ref>

'''Mîm''' was one of the last [[Petty-dwarves]]. 

At some point he was the chieftain of the Petty-dwarves in [[Nargothrond]] before being driven out after attempting to murder [[Finrod]] in his sleep. 

Later, when he and his sons were among the last of the Petty-dwarves, he took [[Túrin]] and his band of outlaws, the [[Gaurwaith]], into his house at [[Amon Rûdh]] in ransom for his life. Though he initially took a liking to Túrin, the arrival of the [[Elf]] [[Beleg]] aroused his hatred and jealousy and he betrayed them to the [[Orc]]s of [[Morgoth]].

Mîm eventually made his way back to Nargothrond following Túrin's slaying of the [[dragon]] [[Glaurung]] where he claimed its treasures. He was soon after slain by [[Húrin]], but in his dying breaths he cursed the treasure. Mîm's curse would go on to have significant repercussions, including bringing about the eventual ruin of [[Doriath]] during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]]. The most renowned item to come of Mîm's cursed treasure was the [[Necklace of the Dwarves]] which would eventually bear a [[Silmaril]].

==History==
===Earlier years at Nargothrond===
{{Quote|For Mîm came of Dwarves that were banished in ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east, and long before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward into Beleriand.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of Túrin Turambar]]""}}
On the River [[Narog]] was a series of caves settled by the Petty-dwarves which they had named [[Nulukkizdîn]].<ref>{{WJ|Last}}</ref>{{rp|243}} By {{FA|52}} only a remnant of their once more numerous people lingered there, and they aided [[Finrod]] who sought to make there a strong place in like manner to [[Menegroth]], for which he rewarded them generously.<ref>{{GA|75}}</ref><ref name=""foundnargo"">{{NM|P3vii}}, p. 305</ref> Eventually Finrod had further help from the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] in extending his underground fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves, and had no compunction in ousting them, especially for great reward; from this Mîm, the chieftain of the Petty-dwarves, developed a special hatred for the Elves.<ref name=""shibboleth"">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>{{rp|434}} Mîm would then attempt to murder Finrod in his sleep, but this failed and he was driven out into the wild.<ref name=""foundnargo"" />

At some point Mîm relocated to another Petty-dwarf settlement, [[Bar-en-Nibin-noeg]], located at the hill [[Amon Rûdh|Sharbhund]] in [[Methiriad]], where caves had been deepened and bored far under the hill in the long years that Petty-dwarves had dwelt there.<ref name=""mim"">{{CH|7}}</ref>{{rp|98}} These cavernous halls were spacious enough to house a hundred or more at need.<ref name=""mim"" />{{rp|103}}

===Encounter with Túrin===
{{Quote|But now at last they had dwindled and died out of Middle-earth, all save Mîm and his two sons; and Mîm was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and forgotten.|''[[Of Mîm the Dwarf]]'', ""[[The Children of Húrin]]""}}

[[File:Alan_Lee_-_The_Petty-dwarves.jpg|thumb|right|''The Petty-dwarves'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
In {{FA|486}}, Mîm and his sons, [[Ibun]] and [[Khîm]], were out gathering in a place of many great stones, leaning or tumbled together. They may have been seeking for old treasures of a dwarf-house near these flat stones, and been carrying ingots of gold which had been disguised.<ref name=""ut_notes"">{{UT|2n}}</ref>{{rp|note 19}} Unluckily, they were spotted by a [[Gaurwaith|band of roaming outlaws]] who then pursued them, with one of the outlaws, [[Andróg]], shooting at them with his bow. While Ibun and Khîm managed to vanish into the dusk, Mîm lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Andróg's hand. Andróg declared Mîm to be an [[Orc]] or of Orc-kin, and called for him to be slain, and was echoed by another outlaw, [[Ulrad]], who felt cheated on finding that Mîm's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, '''Neithan''' ([[Túrin]] in disguise), stayed them however, and bid for Mîm to be let up and permitted to speak.<ref name=""mim"" /> 

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Mîm Pleads For His Life.jpg|thumb|right|''Mîm Pleads For His Life'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Mîm, stumbling on his knees before Túrin's feet, pleaded that he was old and poor, and for Túrin to not let him be slain for no cause. Túrin, in response, asked what Mîm could offer in ransom and noted that his men were looking for a dwelling. Mîm then offered that while he could not give up his dwelling, he could share it. Túrin accepted this, and swore to a weeping Mîm that if they were brought to his home without any trickery, and it was good, then he would not be slain by any of Túrin's followers. As it was late and dark, Mîm initially wished to depart and return for them in the light, but Túrin denied this without the pledge of his sack. Mîm refused to be parted from it, and thus Túrin had him led to their dismal camp, with Mîm cursing along the way in a strange tongue full of ancient hatred; when they arrived, the Men then put bonds on his legs, at which he went suddenly quiet.<ref name=""mim"" />

The next morning they released Mîm, and he spoke fiercely that bonds should not be put on a Dwarf, that he would not forgive them for it, and that he repented his promise. Túrin responded that Mîm was still to lead them to his home, and then looked Mîm in the eyes until Mîm could no longer endure it; Mîm turned away and beckoned for Túrin and his men to follow him.<ref name=""mim"" />

Mîm guided the outlaws, and they spent the day marching to [[Amon Rûdh]]. Once there they climbed through hidden and perilous paths until they eventually arrived at the entrance of Bar-en-Nibin-noeg where Mîm bid them enter and renamed the dwelling as the [[House of Ransom]]. As they entered into the darkness, Mîm clapped his hands and Ibun appeared from around a corner with a small torch. Ibun then informed Mîm that Khîm had been struck by the earlier arrow, and had just died at sunset. Mîm was grieved at this, and exclaimed that being held in bondage by the outlaws had prevented him from able to heal him. Túrin, pitying Mîm, claimed that he would hold himself in Mîm's debt, and promised that if he should come to any wealth he would pay Mîm a ransom of heavy gold in token of sorrow. Mîm marvelled at Túrin, but stated that Andróg must break his bow and arrows and lay them at his sons feet; he further cursed Andróg that he shall never again take arrow or bow, otherwise he shall die by it. Andróg, with great grudge, did this, but himself muttered a curse that Mîm should die with a dart in his throat.<ref name=""mim"" />

[[File:Peter_Xavier_Price_-_Turin_and_Mim.jpg|thumb|right|''Turin and Mim'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
The next day Mîm stated that he and Ibun would serve as guides when the Men went out, and shared his [[earth-bread]] with them excepting Ulrad who he had harsh words for as one of those that put bonds upon him. The outlaws remained there for the rest of year, going on no more raids and only stirring abroad for hunting or gathering of food. The Men started to feel that life would be better if the space were not shared with Mîm, as he would appear out of some shadowy corner or doorway when they thought him elsewhere and thus made them uneasy. It was otherwise for Túrin however, as he became ever more friendly with Mîm, and would sit for hours listening to his councils, lore, and [[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf|tales]] of his life. Mîm in turn was pleased by this, and to Túrin alone would he admit at times to his smithy.<ref name=""mim"" />

In midwinter, [[Beleg]] the [[Elf]], a dear friend of Túrin, suddenly came among them, bearing great items such as the [[Helm of Hador]] and [[lembas]] of [[Melian]].<ref name=""mim"" /> Mîm hated Beleg, as he did all Elves, and this grew as he became jealous of the love that Túrin bore to Beleg. This hatred became all the fiercer when Beleg seemingly undid the curse he had laid on Andróg: the outlaw had taken up bow again, and was struck by a poisoned orc-arrow, but his life was saved by Beleg.<ref name=bowhelm>{{CH|8}}</ref> It further came into Mîm's mind that if were to eat the lembas he would renew his youth and grow strong again; since he could not come by it through stealth, he feigned sickness and begged it from Beleg, but the Elf refused, and thus the seal was set on Mîm's hatred.<ref>{{UT|2o}}</ref>

Together, Túrin and Beleg did great deeds and pushed back [[Morgoth]]'s forces, but in response Morgoth sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. Mîm became aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands about Amon Rûdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by Mîm due to the hatred he bore against Beleg, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, Mîm agreed to lead Morgoth's forces to Túrin's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of Túrin and Beleg in gold; for Mîm's house be left after to him and him alone; for Beleg be left bound for Mîm to deal with; and for Túrin to be let go free. The emissary of Morgoth readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding his promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. Mîm became afraid, and tried to back out, but with the Orcs holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them.<ref name=bowhelm>{{CH|8}}</ref>

Mîm led the Orcs through the secret paths, resulting in the [[sack of Bar-en-Danwedh|sacking of the hideout]]. All of the outlaws were struck down, with Andróg being mortally wounded by an arrow, and Túrin and Beleg captured with nets. Túrin was carried off, but Beleg was left wounded and bound with his wrists and ankles tied to iron pins driven into the rock. Mîm, who had been lurking in the caves during the battle, then emerged and gloated over Beleg while he sharpened a knife. Andróg, however, managed to crawl through the dead bodies and seized a sword which he thrust at the Dwarf. Shrieking in fear, Mîm fled, retreating down a steep and difficult goat's path.<ref name=bowhelm /><ref group=""note"">In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' when Mîm approached Beleg, he picked up [[Anglachel]] from the ground instead of using his knife; Beleg, while not bound, was sorely wounded but managed to wrest the blade from Mîm and scare him away.</ref>

===Return to Nargothrond and death===
In {{FA|499}}, after Túrin had slain [[Glaurung]], Mîm made his way back to Nargothrond. Finding the halls and treasure unguarded, he took possession of them, and sat there in joy fingering the gold and gems, and letting them run ever through his hands.<ref name=q14>{{SM|Q14}}</ref>

In {{FA|502|n}}, [[Húrin]], father of Túrin who had witnessed all that had happened due to being cursed to see with Morgoth's eyes, came across Mîm in Nargothrond. Húrin then slew Mîm, but with his dying breath Mîm cursed the treasure of Nargothrond. Húrin then carried the treasure to [[Doriath]].<ref name=Hurin>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>{{rp|257-258}}

==Legacy==
Thingol employed the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] to work with the treasure, with the most prominent creation being the [[Nauglamír]] bearing a [[Silmaril]]. Enmity arose between Thingol and the Dwarves over this, culminating in a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]].<ref>{{LR|P2III}}</ref> One of the justifications the Dwarves used when claiming the treasure was that it had been taken with violence and murder from a Dwarf, even though Mîm was not in fact akin to them.<ref group=""note"">This detail is provided in [[Concerning ... 'The Hoard']]</ref>

Sometime during the late [[Third Age]] or early [[Fourth Age]], a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] poet wrote a [[The Hoard|poem]] that may have been influenced by ""the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] tale of Túrin and Mîm the Dwarf"".<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Mîm'' is a [[Khuzdul]] name with an unknown meaning,<ref>""[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-925150785.html Mîm]"" on eldamo.org</ref> but in [[Gnomish]], the word ''mim'' means ""gum"".<ref>""[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1439588555.html Mim]"" on eldamo.org</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== The Book of Lost Tales ===
In ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', Mîm is the Dwarf captain of the guards in the service of the dragon Glorund (Glaurung) in the caves of the Rodothlim (Nargothrond). He was left watch Glorund's dwelling and treasury when Glorund set forth to confront Turambar. 

Eventually, however, Glorund was slain and Turambar's father, Úrin, came with a band of rogue Elves to take the treasure. On entering the caves of the Rodothlim, they found that all the Orcs had fled following the death of Glorund, and only Mîm still remained, ""an old misshapen dwarf who sat ever on the pile of gold singing black songs of enchantment to himself"".

When the Elves approached, Mîm stood before the doors of the cave that were once the abode of [[Galweg]]. Mîm warned them hearken to the words of ""Mîm the fatherless"" that they should touch the gold ""no more than were it venomous fires"": it was cursed for Glorund having lain on it for many years, with only Mîm being able to ward it, and by many a dark spell he had bound it to himself. Though Úrin initially wavered, he still bid his men to seize the treasure, and Mîm then broke forth into terrible curses, and for those evil words Úrin then smote him. Dying, Mîm uttered a final curse on the gold: “Now Elves and Men shall rue this deed, and because of the death of Mîm the dwarf shall death follow this gold so long as it remain on Earth, and a like fate shall every part and portion share with the whole.”<ref>{{LT2|II}}</ref>

In ''[[The Nauglafring]]'', the treasure is brought before King Tinwelint of Artanor (Thingol of Doriath) and the curse of Mîm begins its course with greed for the treasure resulting in fighting between Úrin's outlaws and Tinwelint's woodland Elves. After the outlaws were slain, the Queen, Gwenniel (Melian), warns Tinwelint to touch not the gold as it is ""trebly cursed"": by the dragon's breath, by the blood of Tinwelint's subjects, and by the death of the outlaws; even more than that though, ""some more bitter and more binding ill"" hung over it which she could not see.<ref name=""nauglafring"">{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

At the suggestion of [[Ufedhin]], Tinwelint eventually agreed to have the Dwarves of Nogrod forge items from this treasure, with the greatest of them being the Nauglafring (Nauglamír), a carcanet intended to host the Silmaril. After Tinwelint donned the Nauglafring, and the curse of Mîm fell upon him, the Dwarves then asked an outrageous price for their work; for their insolence Tinwelint instead had them whipped and sent off with a meagre reward.<ref name=""nauglafring"" />

[[Naugladur]], the King of Nogrod, then long pondered how to both avenge this insult and sate his greed. Messengers then arrived from [[Bodruith]], the King of the Dwarves of Belegost, informing Naugladur how the treasure had been acquired by the death of Mîm: at this Naugladur ""vowed to rest not ere Mîm was thrice avenged"" and concluded that ""the gold belongs of right to the people of the Dwarves"". The forces of Nogrod and Belegost, joined with a gathered host of Orcs, eventually attacked Artanor and slew Tinwelint, with Naugladur taking possession of the Nauglafring. The curse continued however, with the Nauglafring causing betrayals by Ufedhin and Bodruith in their attempts to seize it for themselves, and providing Beren a means to slay Naugladur in single combat.<ref name=""nauglafring"" />

=== The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf ===
{{Quote|If only I could forgive, I might still catch the shape of one leaf at least, of one flower with dew on it as it shone in the spring by [[Tarn Aeluin]] when I was young, and the skill first ran down into my fingers. But Mîm cannot forgive. The embers of his heart still burn him. Tink-donk donk-tink! No time to think!|From ''[[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf]]''<ref name=collectedpoems/>}}

In ''[[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf]]'', the lamentation of Mîm narrating his life is provided.<ref>{{CG|2II}}, p. 261 (entry ""''[[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf]]''"")</ref>

Mîm spent his youth creating many wondrous works of craft. Only once he became old did he stop and marvel at his creations, and how he had poured almost all of himself into them. To properly hoard them, Mîm then created a great intricate coffer. With his works thus well-stored, he then slept with his head upon the chest.<ref name=Germanpoem>''[[Klett-Cotta: Das erste Jahrzehnt 1977-1987: Ein Almanach]]'', ""''[[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf|Mîms Klage]]''"", pp. 302-5</ref>

He awoke after some unknown amount of time to find people raiding his dwelling, setting it aflame. They took all his possessions, and chased him away, leaving him with only a sack of hand-tools and a secret knife with poisoned runes on its blade. Now old and bitter, he came to a refuge in the wild mountains where tried to begin his work anew, seeking to catch an echo of his memories before they were lost forever. Still further hostilities he encountered, having arrows shot at him when he was seen under daylight.<ref name=Germanpoem/>

Mîm realized that he could only glimpse the works he had once created, not the sights which originally inspired them. He believed that perhaps he would still be able to create wonderful shapes if he could forgive, but for the embers which still smouldered in his heart he could not.<ref name=Germanpoem/>

=== Other works ===
In ''[[The Quenta]]'', Mîm is not given a background before being found occupying Nargothrond, with a few other of his folk, by Húrin and his outlaw companions. Rather than being slain by Húrin directly, he was killed by Húrin's outlaws who were filled with lust for the treasure, though Húrin would have stayed them. Mîm's curse was almost immediately active, with only Húrin eventually reaching Doriath as each of companions died or was slain in quarrels upon the road to it.<ref name=q14/>

A variant on the curse Mîm laid on Andróg is recorded as: ‘May he lack a bow at need ere his end.’<ref name=""ut_notes"" />{{rp|note 18}}

'''Beorn''' was a [[Skin-changers|Skin-changer]], a man who could assume the form of a huge black [[bears|bear]]. He aided [[Thorin and Company]] during their [[Quest of Erebor]].

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - At the Carrock.jpg|[[Jef Murray]] - ''At the Carrock''|thumb|left]]
His origins lay in the distant past, and [[Gandalf]] suspected he and his people had originally come from [[Misty Mountains|the mountains]], until the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] drove them away. He lived with his tame [[horses]] in a [[Beorn's Hall|wooden house]] between the [[Anduin|Great River]] and [[Mirkwood]].

Beorn named stone eyots of the Great River ""carrocks""; the one closer to his home he named ""the [[Carrock]] and created some steps that led from its base to the flat top. While Gandalf knew him, Beorn did not know Gandalf; but he knew his fellow wizard, [[Radagast]]. Once Gandalf saw him as a huge black bear sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and heard him growl in the tongue of bears ""The day will come when [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|they]] will perish and I shall go back!"".<ref name=""Queer"" />

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], Beorn received Gandalf, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the thirteen [[Dwarves]] and gave the Dwarves and Bilbo help in their quest. As Gandalf knew that he disliked guests, he presented the dwarves gradually, while narrating his adventures in an exciting way. Beorn agreed to host them and provided them [[ponies]] until they reached the Mirkwood. To be sure about his ponies, Beorn stalked the company in the form of a bear, seen by Gandalf and Bilbo, and before Gandalf left them, insisted that the Dwarves should leave the ponies behind, as promised, as they had been always under their master's watch.<ref name=""Queer"">{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Beorn heard news of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]'s death in [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref name = ""H14"">{{H|14}}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Beorn appeared transformed into a giant black bear, rescued [[Thorin]] from the [[Orcs|Goblins]] and killed their leader, [[Bolg]].<ref name=""H18"">{{H|18}}</ref>
[[File:David T. Wenzel - Beorn The Return Journey.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Beorn reunites with [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Gandalf]] following the [[Battle of Five Armies]] - Artwork by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]

After Thorin's burial, Beorn followed Bilbo, Gandalf and [[Thranduil]] on their way back to the west. Beorn once more hosted Bilbo and Gandalf and other [[Woodmen]] who came to celebrate [[Yule]].<ref name=""H18"" />

Eventually, he became a ""great chief"" in the [[Vales of Anduin]], and it is said that his descendants also were skin-changers, able to take the shape of a bear.<ref name=""H18"" /> His people became known as the [[Beornings]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref> and they helped defend [[Thranduil]]'s kingdom of northern Mirkwood.<ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>{{fact}}. Beorn presumably died some time before the [[War of the Ring]] began<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> and was succeeded by his son [[Grimbeorn|Grimbeorn the Old]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Character & Appearance==
Beorn was a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. He was generally benevolent and hated goblins and wargs; but he was also a loner and distrustful of travelers and beggars. He was never polite, and became easily angry. He never invited people into his house and his very few friends, who lived a good way away, came no more than a couple to his house at a time. Added to this, Beorn was not fond of [[Dwarves]]. Although fierce to his enemies, once convinced of the others' goodwill, he was welcoming, generous and helpful. He did not eat any meat, as he could talk with his animals, who helped him. His grove was occupied by huge [[bees]]. Beorn's diet was mainly honey and cream.

==Etymology==
'''Beorn''' is an [[Old English]] word,<ref name=""Shippey"">[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (revised and expanded ed. 2012), Chapter 3 The Bourgeois Burglar, The Ring as ‘Equalizer’, p. 91</ref><ref name=""LT1"">{{LT1|In}}, Commentary, about ''Beorn'', the brother of ''Eoh'' and uncle of ''Eriol''</ref><ref name=""RC"">{{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref><ref>{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, On Old English, pp. 212 and Meaningful Names, p. 218</ref> which originally meant ""bear""<ref name=""Shippey""/><ref name=""LT1""/> and also means ""prince"",<ref name=""RC""/><ref name=""IE"">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 218</ref><ref name=""BT"">{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/3757|articlename=BEORN|accessed=4 October 2025}}</ref> ""nobleman"",<ref name=""RC""/><ref name=""BT""/> ""warrior""<ref name=""RC""/><ref name=""IE""/><ref name=""LT1""/><ref name=""BT""/> or poetic ""man""<ref name=""Shippey""/><ref name=""RC""/><ref name=""IE""/><ref name=""BT""/>.<ref name=""AH164"">{{HM|AH}}, pp. 164-5</ref><ref name=""RW"">{{HM|RW}}, pp. 95-6</ref> It is cognate with the [[Old Norse]] word ''björn''.<ref name=""LT1""/>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Ilkorin]] ''[[ber]]'' (""valiant man, warrior"") and [[Danian]] ''[[Beorn (Nandorin)|beorn]]'' (""man"") derive from the [[Elvish]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[BER]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root BER-; cf. root [[BES|BES-]]), p. 352</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name of the character that would become Beorn is ''Medwed''. Medwed's ability to change shape to a bear was due to an enchantment, perhaps of his own.<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}</ref> It has been suggested that ''Medwed'' is a Slavic name<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}, 'vi. Radagast', 'The Name Radagast'</ref> with ''[[wiktionary:medved|medved]]'' being a common Slavic word for ""bear"".

It should be noted that [[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/medv%C4%9Bd%D1%8C|''medved'']] is a taboo word for ""bear"" with the literal sense being ""honey-eater""; the same etymology is constructed by J.R.R. Tolkien for the [[Noldorin]] word ''[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2314741507.html megli]'' (''mad-'' ""eat"" + ''glî'' ""honey""; thus ""honey eater""),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root '''LIS-''' and root '''MAT-''' </ref> suggesting that Tolkien was aware of the slavic word.

==Inspiration==
It has been suggested that the character Beorn was influenced by the Norse ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrólfr Kraki]]''.<ref name=""RME73"">[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (revised and expanded ed. 2012), pp. 91-2</ref> In the saga appears a great bear defending [[wikipedia:Hrólfr Kraki|Hrólfr Kraki]], and also a man cursed to being transformed into a bear during nighttime. The work was well-known to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as one of his students and friend, Stella Miller, made [[The Saga of Hrolf Kraki|a translation of the saga]] dedicated to Tolkien, [[E.V. Gordon]] and C.T. Onions;<ref name=""AH164"" /> but even more importantly as Tolkien himself wrote an unpublished short story of the tale, entitled ''[[Sellic Spell]]''.<ref>{{HM|MB}}, pp. 256-60</ref>

Another suggested inspiration is the character of ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', ""''whose name is commonly explained as Beowulf = 'bees' wolf' = honey-eater = bear, and one who breaks swords, rips off arms and cracks ribs with ursine power and clumsiness.''""<ref name=""RME73"" />

'''Bard''', titled ""'''the Bowman'''"", was a descendant of [[Girion]], the [[Lord of Dale]], who slew the dragon [[Smaug]] and refounded [[Dale]]. He ruled his [[Kingdom of Dale|new kingdom]] as '''Bard I'''.

==History== 
Bard, the heir of [[Girion]], the last [[Lord of Dale]] whose wife and children had fled from the ruin of Dale down the [[River Running]] was known for his worth and courage and lived in Lake-town when Smaug attacked the town<ref name=""Fire"">{{H|Fire}}</ref> in {{TA|2941}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> When Bard recognized that the dragon was coming, he ran to the [[Master of Lake-town]] and shouted to cut the bridges and to get arms. Bard cheered on the archers and held out with a great yew bow in the burning town as the captain of a company of archers. He was an able archer and had inherited a [[black arrow]] from his ancestors, which had never failed him and which he had always recovered.<ref name=""Fire""/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Black Arrow.jpg|thumb|left|''The Black Arrow'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When Bard had shot all his arrows, except the black arrow, which he had saved for his last shot, the old [[Thrushes|thrush]] (who had overheard [[Bilbo Baggins]]' description of [[Smaug]])<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> revealed an unarmoured spot on the Dragon's armpit to him and Bard killed the dragon by shooting him in the unarmoured spot with the black arrow. Because of his miraculous shot, he was given the epithet ""the Bowman"" and ""the Dragon-shooter"".<ref name=""Fire""/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|''The Arkenstone'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the disaster, he led the [[Lake-men]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]] demanding a part of the treasure from the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=""Gather"">{{H|Gathering}}</ref> The [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and [[Thranduil]] came to demand their own shares. Seeing [[Thorin]]'s reluctance to help, Bilbo Baggins delivered the [[Arkenstone]] to them to bargain with.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref> Afterwards, when the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] came, Bard led his Men in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

The victors divided the treasure and Bard took Bilbo's fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the Arkenstone, whereupon he shared his reward with the [[Master of Lake-town]] to rebuild the town, and gave Thranduil the emeralds of Girion.<ref name=""Gather""/> However, the Master stole the money and ran off into the wild where he died of hunger.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> 

Three years later, in {{TA|2944}} after the rebuilding of the city, Bard became the first [[King of Dale|King]] of [[Kingdom of Dale|restored Dale]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2944, p. 1089</ref> He was succeeded by his son, [[Bain]] in {{TA|2977}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2977, p. 1090</ref>

== Etymology ==
It is not known, if Bard was a name in the [[language of Dale]] and the [[Long Lake]]. This language is only represented by a few names, especially the names of the [[Dwarves]], which came from that region. The names of those Dwarves are  [[Old Norse]] names.<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> In other Germanic names (such as [[Isembard Took|Isembard]]), ''bard'' refers to ''beard''. This could be either the facial hair, or more likely ''""Battle-Axe""'' (''beard'' is also a term for a part of an axe).

Jim Allan suggests that Bard is a Germanic element, which means ""Battle-axe"".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 226</ref>

Bjoern Fromen suggests that Bard could be a modernized (i.e. anglicised/westronized) form of Old Norse ''Barthi'' (recte ''bartha'') (""battle-axe"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Bjoern Fromen|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c3612b3e7d8c2909d5e97|articlename=Bain, Bard, Brand; Kloczko's Dictionnair|website=tolkienlistsearch|accessed=16 November 2024}}</ref>

Robert Ireland and [[Ruth S. Noel]], who perhaps overlooked the connection to Old Norse, provide as translations the [[Celtic]] words, ''bárd'' (""guardian"")<ref>Robert Ireland, [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/LOTR/LOTR_AC.html Lord of the Rings Dictionary, A - C]</ref> and ''bard'' (""poet"").<ref>[[Ruth S.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In his original concept of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] intended Bilbo Baggins to be the slayer of Smaug the Dragon, stabbing him in his sleep in his lair in the [[Lonely Mountain]].  Tolkien then changed his mind and in a major shift decided that Smaug would die at [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref>{{HH|PNC}}, pp. 496-497</ref>  This necessitated the creation of a hero, Bard, who was revealed to be the descendant of Girion.  Having created this dragon-slayer, Tolkien was going to let him die in the wreck of Lake-town.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, p. 549</ref>  However, realizing new possibilities for the story, especially having a rightful claimant to part of the dragon's hoard other than the Dwarves, Tolkien kept Bard alive.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, (i) ''Bard the Dragon-Slayer'', p. 555</ref>

He becomes a hero among the town's survivors and leads them in taking refuge in the remains of [[Dale]]. When [[Thranduil]] arrives with an army of [[Elves]] to attack the mountain, Bard attempts to peacefully come to terms with Thorin. He asks him for a portion of the treasure which Thorin had promised to the people of Lake-town, but Thorin refuses to give them anything while Thranduil's army remains. After this, Bard reluctantly joins Thranduil in his attack. However, the arrival of an [[Orcs|Orc]] army leads all involved to refocus their attention and battle the Orcs instead.

'''Brand''' was a [[King of Dale]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Brand was the son of King [[Bain]] and grandson of [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]]<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref> who had killed the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref> 

He became the king of [[Dale]] and by {{TA|3018}} he had extended the realm of Dale far south and east of [[Esgaroth]].<ref name=""Meetings""/>

At the [[Council of Elrond]] the dwarf [[Glóin]] reported that a year earlier (in {{TA|3017}}) a messenger from [[Mordor]] had come to speak to [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]].  He also said that messengers had spoken to King Brand and that he was afraid, for war appeared to be gathering on his eastern borders.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

King Brand remained steadfast though.  In {{TA|3019|}} when a host of [[Sauron]]'s allies crossed the River [[Carnen]] he retreated into [[Dale]].  There the [[Men of Dale]] and the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] fought for three days.  Brand was slain at the side of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] during the [[Battle of Dale]], at the end of which the victorious [[Easterlings]] drove the allies (including his son, Bard) into [[Erebor]] where they were besieged. 

However, when news of Sauron's defeat came his northern army was dismayed with his son (and Dáin's son, [[Thorin III|Thorin]]) breaking the siege.  King Brand was succeeded by his son, [[Bard II]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] possibly derived the name ''Brand'' from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:brand#Old English|brand]]'' (""fire-brand, torch; sword"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413 (discussion on name ''[[Erkenbrand]]'')</ref> [[Jim Allan]] suggests that it is derived from the Germanic element ''brand'', which means ""brand"".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 226</ref>

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
: Despite not featuring in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card depicting the character.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''

:Brand makes two minor appearances during the [[Battle of Dale]] and before the [[Siege of Erebor]] in two adventure ""instances"" designed for groups of six or twelve players. Unlike in the books, Brand is depicted being slain by arrows in the crossing of the [[River Running]] while guarding his people's retreat to the Mountain. This inconsistency is referenced in a later quest in which a notorious dwarf tale-spinner describes events unfolding this way, and the player has the option to agree with the veracity of his tale or to disagree in favour of the canonical version of Brand's death.

'''Finduilas''' was a [[Noldor]]in princess of the [[First Age]]. She was the daughter of [[Orodreth]], the ruler of [[Nargothrond]], and the sister of [[Gil-galad]].<ref name=Find/>

== History ==
Finduilas lived in Nargothrond with her father and brother under the rule of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. She was betrothed to [[Gwindor]], who named her '''Faelivrin''', which meant ""Gleam of the Sun on the [[Pools of Ivrin]]"".<ref name=""CH10"">{{CH|10}}</ref> 
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
Her betrothed was captured in {{FA|472}} during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] by [[Morgoth]],<ref>{{GA|227}}</ref> but he returned in {{FA|490|n}} with a companion<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> who called himself ''[[Agarwaen]], son of [[Úmarth]]'' (""Bloodstained, son of the Cursed""). Unknown to Finduilas, this was actually [[Túrin]] son of [[Húrin]].

Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, who was now mutilated, Finduilas fell in love with noble Túrin who became an influential warrior of Nargothrond.  Túrin failed to notice her feelings, she reminded him of [[Lalaith]], the sister he lost in childhood. Gwindor realized that Finduilas had fallen in love with Túrin, and revealed his name to her in an attempt to discourage her pursuit.<ref name=""CH10""/>

At the [[Sack of Nargothrond]] by [[Glaurung]], Finduilas was captured. Gwindor was slain after ordering Túrin to protect Finduilas as only she could save him from his fate; however he was entranced by the dragon, and he could not hear Finduilas' cries as she was being dragged past him by the [[Orcs]] as a captive for [[Angband]].<ref>{{CH|11}}</ref> 

Due to Glaurung's deceit, Túrin abandoned Finduilas and instead went to [[Hithlum]] in search for his kin. When the Orcs were waylaid by the [[Haladin]] of [[Brethil]] at the [[Crossings of Teiglin]] they killed all their captives, pinning Finduilas to a tree with a spear. 

By this time, Túrin had regained his senses, and the Haladin buried her in a mound they called ''[[Haudh-en-Elleth]]'' (""Mound of the Elf-maiden"").<ref>{{CH|13}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Finduilas.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Finduilas'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. The first element of the name seems to be ''[[fîn]]'' (""hair""), but the etymology of the rest of her name is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-307788327.html|articlename=S. ''Finduilas'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=10 September 2023}}</ref>

A name from a draft of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' could also contain the element ''uilas'': ''Mindor Uilas'', suggested by [[Roman Rausch]] to translate as ""Isolated Mountain of ''Ever-leaf''"".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1734642273.html|articlename=N.

== Other names ==
Finduilas was also called '''''Faelivrin''''' (""Gleam of the [[Sun]] on the Pools of [[Ivrin]]"") in Sindarin, from ''[[fael]]'' (""gleam of the sun"") + the proper name ''[[Ivrin]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1420957629.html|articlename=S.

===The Book of Lost Tales===
In the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the character appears as '''Failivrin''', being one of the [[Rodothlim]], daughter of the [[Gnome]] [[Galweg]]. When [[Túrin]] joined their people, he usually helped her father in the fight against the [[Orcs]], so she could see him often. She became captivated by Túrin's hidden sadness, but as he had a hardened heart, she wept in secret for him, ""and she grew so pale that folk marvelled at the whiteness and delicacy of her face and her bright eyes that shone therein"". When he later gained fame among the Rodothlim, her love for him grew, and she always defended him when people murmured against him. He treated her with courtesy, saying he had found a fair sister in the lands of the Gnomes.<ref name=Turambar>{{LT2|II}}</ref>{{rp|82–3}}

When [[Melko]] attacked the Rodothlim with a great army and the dragon [[Glorund]], Túrin came to Galweg's place in the caves, and found him dead. Failivrin sought confort in his arms and he realized his loved for her. However, the place was attacked by Orcs, and only Túrin and [[Flinding]] were there to protect her. After Flinding's death, Túrin was taken out by Glorund's breath and paralyzed by its [[Magic|enchanting]] eyes. Thus, when Failivring was captured and carried out in front of him, she cried to him: ""''O Túrin Mormakil, where is thy heart; O my beloved, wherefore dost thou forsake me?''"". Hearing her cry, Túrin almost broke the enchantment, but Glorund stopped him and talked to him, making him to believe his family was in danger. Against all wisdom and his own heart, Túrin forsook Failivrin, and her sad fate was never known.<ref name=Turambar/>{{rp|84–7}}

It is notable that the element of Failivrin already appears in the earliest outlines of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] for the story of Túrin.<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, p. 138</ref> As can be read above, she is not given a conclusion for her story, nor she is anyway related to the characters of Orodreth and Flinding (later [[Gwindor]]) as in later narratives.

'''Legolas''' was an [[Elf]] of [[Gondolin]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
He was one of the [[house of the Tree]], a scout under [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]]. Because of his keen eyes and knowledge of the mountainous area, he was chosen by the escapees of the [[Fall of Gondolin]] to be in front and guide them across the [[Cirith Thoronath|Cristhorn]].<ref name=""III"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>

Following the fall, he moved to [[Tol Eressëa]], where he was named '''''Laiqalassë'''''.<ref name=""IIIn"">{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 217</ref>

== Etymology ==
The meaning of ''Legolas'' was twofold in [[Gnomish]]: it could mean ""Greenleaf"", from ''laigos'' (""greenness"") + ''las'' (""leaf""); but in the form '''''Legolast''''' it could mean ""Keen sight"", from ''leg, lêg'' (""keen, piercing"") + ''last'' (""look, glance"").<ref name=""app"">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Tári-Laisi""</ref>

'''Amandil''' was the eighteenth and last [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] in [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Elendil</ref> In common with his ancestors, Amandil was a member of the [[Faithful]], those [[Númenóreans]] who still revered the [[Valar]] in opposition to the [[King's Men]].  After the Downfall of Númenor, Amandil's son [[Elendil]] would found the Númenórean [[Realms in Exile]].<ref name=Akallabeth/>

== History ==
When he was young Amandil was a great friend of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], who as King kept Amandil in his Council even though he was an Elf-friend. Amandil also gained early fame as a mighty sea-captain, and was held in honour by many due to the high nobility of his house.<ref name=Akallabeth/>

However, after Ar-Pharazôn sailed to [[Middle-earth]] and took [[Sauron]] prisoner, the supposed captive gradually turned the King to his will.  Seeing the favour bestowed upon Sauron, all of the King's counselors save Amandil began to fawn upon the former captive, who induced the King and his followers to begin worshiping [[Morgoth|Melkor]].  Amandil was dismissed from the Council and he withdrew to [[Rómenna]], where he secretly gathered all of the Faithful.<ref name=Akallabeth/>

When Amandil became aware of the purpose of the King to assault [[Aman]] he was filled with dread.  He called his son Elendil to him and revealed his plan to sail into the West to seek aid from [[Manwë]].  Amandil made his preparations in secret lest dire punishment fall upon his house.  He counseled his son to prepare ships to lie in the haven of Rómenna to escape when they saw their time.  Upon his departure Amandil pretended to sail east before circling about to head west.  He took with him three trusted servants but he and they were never heard from again.<ref name=Akallabeth/>

== Etymology==
''Amandil'' is [[Quenya]]. The name is glossed to mean ""Lover of Aman"".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> According to Paul Strack, the name is a compound of ''[[Aman]]'' (""Blessed Realm"") and ''[[-ndil|-(n)dil]]'' (""friend, lover, devoted to"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2943820837.html|articlename=Q. ''Amandil'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=12 December 2021}}</ref>

''Aphanuzîr'' is an [[Adûnaic]] name.<ref name=Aphanuzir>{{SD|3iiic}}, p. 389</ref> Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests it means ""Bliss-friend"" and is a combination of the objective form of ''aphana'' (""bliss"") and an agental-formation for the verb ''zîr-'' (""to love"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2313573009.html|articlename=Ad.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
[[Elentir]], intended to be a brother of Amandil, was a character developed but never fully adapted into the formal history of Númenor. In one version of the story of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], his future wife [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]], the daughter of the current king, was betrothed to Elentir. However, she fell desperately in love with Pharazôn and chose to become his queen when he took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]]. This story is very different than the tale in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', where Ar-Pharazôn takes Míriel very much against her will in order to claim the Sceptre. In either case, Elentir disappeared before Nùmendil died, leaving Amandil as the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].<ref name=AkallabethPM/>

{{Quote|Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments.

'''Glóin''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's Folk]], the son of [[Gróin]], the brother of [[Óin]], and the father of [[Gimli]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He is most famous as one of [[Thorin]]'s companions on the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. 77 years after the Quest of Erebor,  Glóin attended the [[Council of Elrond]] with his son Gimli, where the latter would represent dwarves in the Fellowship of the Ring

==History==
Glóin was likely born in [[Dunland]], where the Dwarves of Durin's Line dwelt in exile<ref name=""Durin""/> after their expulsion from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2770}}.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Glóin was present at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]],<ref name=""Durin""/> which was odd because Dwarves were considered to be mere striplings in their thirties, yet at the time ({{TA|2799|n}}<ref name=""TA""/>) Glóin was but 16 (his cousin [[Balin]] also was among the participants).  After the war, in which the dwarves were victorious,  Glóin returned to Dunland with the followers of Thorin, who then re-moved the dwarves to the [[Ered Luin]], the Blue Mountains, west of the [[Shire]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

===Life in Thorin's Halls===
During Glóin's life in Ered Luin he saw the departure of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]], who tried to go back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], but was captured and tortured for the [[Ring of Thrór]], and subsequently died several years later.  Under King [[Thorin]], Glóin and the other Dwarves living in [[Thorin's Halls]] in the mountains became prosperous in a fashion and trafficked goods with other peoples, and gained what wealth they could. But ever they spoke of the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name=""Durin""/> In {{TA|2879}}, Glóin has a son, [[Gimli]], who was considered too young to join [[Thorin and Company]] at the age of 62.

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941|n}} Thorin happened to meet [[Gandalf]] the Wizard.  From this meeting came Thorin's determination to return to the Lonely Mountain with a company of Dwarves, including Glóin, to seek revenge upon Smaug.  Gandalf came to a conclave of the Dwarves after visiting [[the Shire]] (but before seeing [[Bilbo Baggins]]) to persuade them to take the hobbit with them.  The Dwarves were skeptical, with Glóin calling them ""simpletons"" and claiming that one of them ""would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell!""<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}, ''Extracts from the earlier version''</ref>

Glóin was the fifth Dwarf in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]] for the Unexpected Party, and he came wearing a white hood.  Glóin did not assist in setting the table nor did he bring a musical instrument out when Thorin called for music.  After Bilbo had his fit of fright he overheard Glóin sneer that the hobbit looked ""more like a grocer than a burglar"" when he saw him ""bobbing and puffing on the mat"".  This affronted Bilbo enough to make him agree to undertake the quest.  Then, when Gandalf proclaimed that Bilbo was his choice he scowled at Glóin so fiercely that the dwarf huddled back in his chair, and later glaring at Bilbo.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

On their quest Glóin was quite useful, especially at making fires, although on the night the company met the trolls, [[William]], [[Bert]], and [[Tom]], he and his brother failed to start one and began to fight, yet though first they quarreled.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>  On the night when the company came to the glade of the [[Wargs]], Glóin along with his brother, Dori, Nori and Ori secured a seat in a huge pine tree.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  At [[Beorn]]'s home Glóin and Óin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to appear as Gandalf spun their tale.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  And when released from his barrel near [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], Glóin was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed but half alive, and needed to be carried ashore.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Glóin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], who became King after Thorin's death. Glóin settled in the Lonely Mountain, along with the survivors of the battle, and would grow wealthy in Erebor under the leadership of King Dáin.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
In October {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> Glóin and his son [[Gimli]] were sent by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] to [[Rivendell]] to seek advice concerning the fate of [[Balin's Colony]] in Moria.  When [[Frodo Baggins]] recovered from his wounds and attended the feast, it was Glóin who sat next to him and gave him the news from Erebor and surrounding lands since the time of Bilbo.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>  Later, at the [[Council of Elrond]], Glóin spoke of the shadow that had fallen upon his people, Balin's expedition and of the sinister messenger from [[Mordor]] who had come to inquire about [[Hobbits]] and where they dwelt.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Glóin's greatest contribution to the [[War of the Ring]] was his son Gimli, who joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

It is possible that Glóin fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against the [[Easterlings]] during the [[War of the Ring]], for he lived until {{FoA|15}}.<ref name=""Durin""/> After the War of the Ring it is unknown whether he saw Gimli again after he explored [[Fangorn Forest]] and the [[Glittering Caves]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In both the early manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and in the published version, Glóin had heard of Bilbo's great-great-great-grand-uncle [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]], who accidentally invented the game of Golf.  However, only in the early manuscript it was mentioned that Glóin was very fond of golf.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 40</ref>

In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', the dwarf [[Burin]] (also [[Frár]]), being Balin's son (from Thorin and Company) was suppose to accompany Glóin to the [[Council of Elrond]], and that would later join [[The Fellowship of the Ring]], though it was changed to Gimli, and also changed to be Glóin's son, in the final draft of the novel.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>

'''Thráin II''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2644|n}} – {{TA|2850|n}}, aged 206 years) was King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 60 years, from {{TA|2790}} to {{TA|2850|n}}, during their exile from [[Lonely Mountain]]. He was the son of [[Thrór]] and father of [[Thorin|Thorin II]], [[Frerin]], and [[Dís]]. Thorin II would later be known as [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

== History ==
Thráin fled with his father and a small group of companions when the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2770}} descended on Lonely Mountain and sacked the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdom. King Thrór, Thráin, and the others eventually settled in [[Dunland]] and scratched out a meager living. Thrór was devastated by the loss of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and left his people to journey north. He took a single companion, [[Nár]], but left his son with his [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]], along with the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to Lonely Mountain.
 
In {{TA|2790}}<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> Nár returned to tell Thráin that his father had been captured and butchered by the [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain [[Azog]] when they had journeyed to the mines of [[Moria]]. Even worse, Azog had beheaded Thrór and carved his own name on Thrór's forehead to show the Dwarves that an Orc now ruled their ancestral home.

Thráin sat for seven days without speaking, until he stood and said ""This cannot be borne!"".<ref name=""Durin""/> 

=== War of the Dwarves and Orcs ===
Filled with righteous anger, by {{TA|2793}}<ref name=""TA""/> Thráin had gathered together a massive army of Dwarves to wage the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. The army included the exiles of the Lonely Mountain, Thráin's [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|kin]] from the [[Iron Hills]] under his uncle [[Grór]], and even some Dwarves not of Durin's folk. One by one they assaulted the Orc-holds of the [[Misty Mountains]], destroying their great warrens in [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] and eventually facing Azog himself in [[Dimrill Dale]] (''Azanulbizar'' in [[Khuzdul]]) before the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria]]. 

In {{TA|2799}}<ref name=""TA""/> Thráin and his army fought the bloody [[Battle of Azanulbizar]]. Thráin was blinded in one eye and suffered a leg-wound. While the Orcs were vanquished and Azog slain, the Dwarves took heavy losses, including Thráin's son Frerin, his cousin [[Náin son of Grór|Náin]], and [[Fundin]] father of Dwarven hero [[Balin]]. 

King Thráin II wanted to enter Moria and reclaim it, but the Dwarves not of Durin's folk refused, saying that the city was not their Fathers' House; they had honoured Thrór's memory by fighting, and this was enough. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] had peered within the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] and also warned Thráin that [[Durin's Bane]] still dwelt within Khazad-dûm.<ref name=""Durin""/>

=== Wanderings and imprisonment ===
After the war, Thráin and Thorin led the exiles of Lonely Mountain west to live in the southern [[Blue Mountains]] where they settled in {{TA|2802}}.<ref name=""TA""/> Over the next forty years Thráin grew increasingly consumed with the lost riches of the Lonely Mountain. This may have been partly because of the [[Ring of Thrór]]. 

In {{TA|2841}}<ref name=""TA""/> he left the Blue Mountains with a small group that included [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]]. Travelling east, the group was constantly harassed by wolves, Orcs, and other fell creatures. In {{TA|2845|n}},<ref name=""TA""/> while camped under the eaves of [[Mirkwood]], Thráin disappeared and would never be seen again by his kin. The King of Durin's folk had been captured by Sauron's agents and was taken to the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] in southern Mirkwood. There Sauron tortured Thráin, took back the last of the [[Seven Rings|seven Dwarf-rings]], and left him in the dungeon to die.

In {{TA|2850}},<ref name=""TA""/> while on a reconnaissance mission to Dol Guldur, [[Gandalf]] came upon Thráin, who was so diminished that he could not even remember his own name. Thráin gave Gandalf his last two possessions, the key and map to the Lonely Mountain, and shortly thereafter died. Gandalf left him without knowing who he was.<ref name=""Durin""/>

===Legacy===
Much later Gandalf met Thorin Oakenshield near [[Bree]] and realized that the Dwarf he had found in Dol Guldur was Thráin, the vanished King of Durin's folk. Gandalf and Thorin discussed reclaiming Lonely Mountain, and Gandalf gave much assistance to [[Thorin and Company]], including the map and key to Lonely Mountain, along with a suggestion that they include a [[Bilbo Baggins|burglar]] in their quest.<ref name=""Durin""/>

Gandalf mentioned to the Fellowship, as they were debating about going into Moria, that he had been in the mines before looking for Thráin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Þráinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Stubborn"".<ref name=""IE"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 223</ref><ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref> [[Jim Allan]] noted that ''Thráin'' went stubbornly off to Erebor again.<ref name=""IE""/>

Finally, in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', he is portrayed by [[Antony Sher]] at old age in Dol Guldur, and by Mike Mizrahi at young age, during the Battle of Azanulbizar.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:In the Extended Edition of this film, Thráin Is first seen in a flashback to the Battle of Azanulbizar during the prologue while [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] discuss his possible whereabouts. In this flashback, Thráin insists Thorin stay back as he leads a charge toward the [[Great Gates]] (though he is not seen again during the battle or its aftermath).

:Old and delirious, Thráin is again seen later at [[Dol Guldur]] when Gandalf arrives to investigate. He tracks the [[Wizards|Wizard]], and ultimately attacks him in a fit of madness. Gandalf is able to overtake him and calm him. Thráin warns Gandalf to not let Thorin near the [[Lonely Mountain]] because he has learned that [[Smaug]] is in league with [[Sauron|The One]]. He ultimately helps Gandalf navigate through the fortress before [[Azog]] and several other [[Orcs]] attack. The two of them try to escape but are eventually stopped by the shadow of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Thráin tells Gandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, and is swallowed up the shadow, which then reveals itself as [[Sauron]] to Gandalf.

'''Fengel''' ({{TA|2870}} - {{TA|2953|n}}) was the fifteenth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Fengel was the third and only surviving son of [[Folcwine]], and became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2903}}.

Fengel's two older brothers, [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], were killed in the fief [[South Gondor]] while fighting for [[Gondor]], and as a result Fengel grew up rather spoiled. As a grown man he became known for his greed and love of gold.

His son [[Thengel]] left Rohan because of disagreements with his father, living with [[Morwen Steelsheen|his wife]]'s family in [[Gondor]] instead.

After a rule of over 50 years Fengel died in {{TA|2953}}, and Thengel reluctantly returned to Rohan.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Fengel'' means ""prince"" in [[Old English]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 644</ref> The word appears in three places in ''Beowulf.'' The word is from a Germanic root meaning ""to grasp"".

:In the last winter of his reign, King Fengel was hunting north of the [[Entwade]] when an elderly woman named Wyrgende stumbled into his camp. Fengel sent her away into the dark night and the next day she was found frozen to death at the foot of a tall boulder, in which she had carved a curse against him. King Fengel was furious and ordered Wyrgende's body burned and the stone destroyed, but no man of his company could more her, and every hammer and mattock they set to the stone shattered on contact. Fengel himself assailed the stone with his sword until the blade shattered, and a shard pierced his thigh. The wound festered, and King Fengel died of poisoned blood on the first day of Spring.

'''Farin''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's folk]].

== History ==
Farin was one of the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]]. When his uncle King [[Dáin I]] and cousin [[Frór]] had been slain by a [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]], his people were forced to flee the [[Dragons|dragon]]-plagued [[Grey Mountains]] while he was just 29 years old. Farin's father, [[Borin]], joined [[Thrór]] when he rebuilt the [[Lonely Mountain|Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|2590|n}}.<ref name=Durin/>

Farin was the father of [[Fundin]] and [[Gróin]], and therefore an ancestor to both [[Balin]] of [[Thorin and Company]] and [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]], one of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

In {{TA|2770|n}} the dragon [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|sacked the Lonely Mountain]], driving its people into exile.

== Etymology ==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Farin'' is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''farinn'' (""travelled-one"").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 224</ref>

'''Eradan''' is one of the three main characters of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. He is a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] and was born before {{TA|2988}} in the [[Angle]]. He was both a skilled swordsman and archer, and a great tracker.<ref name=""Backstory Eradan""/> He is voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=""voices"">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/news/35-game-info/644-qaa-the-voices-of-war-in-the-north|articlename=Q&A: The Voices of War in the North|dated=20 July 2011|website=www.warinthenorth.com|accessed=February 14, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
===Youth===
The ancestors of Eradan were members of a noble family from [[Númenor]], who served [[Elendil]]. After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they went in exile to [[Middle-earth]] and lived in [[Arnor]], where they served the [[Kings of Arnor|heirs of Elendil]]. After the fall of that kingdom they continued to serve the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]].

[[File:The Lord of the Rings- War in the North - Concept Art of Eradan1.png|250px|thumb|left|Concept Art of '''Eradan'''.]]Eradan spend his youth in a small [[Dúnedain]] settlement in the [[Angle]], while his father, [[Baranor (video game character)|Baranor]], served [[Aragorn]] as an [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. While Baranor and a company of Dúnedain patrolled the [[Misty Mountains]] he didn't return. After the loss of his father, Eradan was fostered by his uncle, [[Dunhir]].

===Life as a Ranger===
After he was grown up he started his training to be a Ranger. After only two years he completed his training and started to fight the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and [[Trolls]] who roamed the east of [[Eriador]]. Eradan gained a high reputation as swordsman and archer, and his skills as outdoorsman and tracker were exceptional high. 

When Aragorn doubled the defenses of [[the Shire]] Eradan served as one of the guards of [[Sarn Ford]] for many years under the command of [[Halbarad]]. In {{TA}} 3016 Aragorn became more active in the Shire's defense. In this time Eradan impressed Aragorn with his skills and bravery. Eradan accompenied Aragorn on many of his travels, on which Aragorn taught him even more about tracking.<ref name=""Backstory Eradan""/> In {{TA|3018}} he met [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] and [[Andriel]] as they joined the guards of the [[Sarn Ford]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=The Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=24 December 2011}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Aragorn, Eradan, Andriel and Farin in the Prancing Pony.png|300px|thumb|[[Andriel]], '''Eradan''' and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] meet [[Aragorn]] in the [[Prancing Pony]].]]When the [[Nazgûl]] attacked the [[Sarn Ford]] all three fought under the command of Halbarad in an attempt to prevent them entering the Shire. They were defeated and most of the rangers were killed. After the attack, Eradan, Andriel and Farin saw and overheard a meeting between the [[Witch-king]] and [[Agandaûr]]. Agandaûr told the Witch-king he had assembled an army of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] in [[Fornost]]. 

Halbarad sent the three to [[Bree]], where they meet with Aragorn in the [[Prancing Pony]]. They tell Aragorn what happened, who sends them to Fornost, where they have to stop Agandaûr's army before it attacks [[Bree]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Prologue</ref>

After arriving in Fornost they are attacked by several groups of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] and find a chained [[Eagles|eagle]]. After Eradan and his companions helped him to escape, he introduces himself as [[Beleram]] and explains how he has been captured.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> In regards of his rescue, Beleram decides to help them stop Agandaûr.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer Wards''</ref>

In the inner wards of Fornost the companions meet with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], who've been sent by [[Elrond|their father]] to scout Fornost. Andriel introduces Eradan and Farin to Elladan and Elrohir. After finding out they're appointed to deal with the same task, the two groups decide to work together. Firstly Elladan and Elrohir lead Eradan and his friends to the citadel, but latter on they take separate roads.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner wards''</ref> But meet again - after surviving several ambushes - at the gate of the citadel. The gate of the citadel has been protected by Agandaûr with [[magic]]. As the sons of [[Elrond]] use all their power and concentration to remove the magical protection, Eradan, Andriel, Farin and Beleram protect them against an attack of [[Orcs]] and a [[Troll]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref>

Inside the Citadel tower the group overhear a conservation between Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], who informs the earlier about intruders. Here, Eradan, Andriel and Farin are again separated from the sons of Elrond. The earlier fight and kill Tharzog and his guard. After which they proceed to the top of the tower, where they find Agandaûr fighting the sons of Elrond. Agandaûr - seeing he is outnumbered - flees on a [[Fell Beast]]. Although Beleram chases him, he has to give up after Agandaûr creates a thunderstorm.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>

'''Belladonna Baggins''' (née '''Took''') ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2852|n}} - {{TA|2934|n}}, died aged 82) was the mother of [[Bilbo Baggins]].

==History==
Belladonna was one of the three remarkable daughters of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref> She had eight older brothers (and one younger), and was the eldest of the three daughters.<ref name=""Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref> Belladonna married [[Bungo Baggins]], who built a spacious hole for her (partly with her money).<ref name=""Party""/> It became the residence of the [[Baggins Family]], and in {{TA|2890|n}}, her son and only child [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] was born. She died in {{TA|2934|n}},<ref name=""Took""/> eight years after her husband.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
''[[wikipedia:Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]'' is the name of a poisonous plant,<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'', ""[[An Unexpected Party]]"", note 8</ref> fitting in with the Hobbit-habit of naming girls after flowers.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>

The word is understood as an Italian name, a rarity among Hobbits, and translates as ""beautiful lady"" although it derives from Latin ''bladone'' ""nightshade"".

The name participates in a circular wordplay with the names of her sisters, [[Mirabella Took|Mira'''bella''']] and [[Donnamira Took|'''Donna'''mira]], also Italian names.

==Inspiration==
In her first appearance in the fiction, Belladonna - which has stayed unchanged from the earliest survived sketch of the story<ref>{{HM|MB}}, ""[[The Bladorthin Typescript]]""</ref> -  is described as ""one of three remarkable daughters of the Old Took"". [[Humphrey Carpenter]], in his attempt to draw an analogy between Bilbo and Tolkien, noted that Tolkien's mother, [[Mabel Suffield]], was one of three remarkable daughters of [[John Suffield]], who lived to be nearly a hundred.<ref>{{B|IV}}, ""Enter Mr. Baggins"", page 175</ref>

'''Anárion''' was the second son of [[Elendil]] and the brother of [[Isildur]].<ref name=""Rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref>  His son [[Meneldil]] was the last man born in [[Númenor]] before its [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]].<ref name=""Gladden"">{{UT|Gladden}}, Note 10</ref>

==History==
Anárion, together with his father and brother, were the leaders of the [[Faithful]], the small minority of [[Númenóreans]] that resisted the dark rule of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] and his councilor [[Sauron]]. In {{SA|3319}}, when [[Ar-Pharazôn]] assailed the land of [[Aman]],<ref name=""SA"">{{App|SA}}</ref> nine ships of the Faithful escaped to the east (four for Elendil, three for Isildur, and two for Anárion).<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> They were separated by the great storm that arose during the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]]. Elendil landed in northern [[Middle-earth]] near [[Lindon]] and there established the realm of [[Arnor]]. Isildur and Anárion, however, landed in the south and founded the realm of [[Gondor]] in {{SA|3320|n}} about the [[Mouths of Anduin]].<ref name=""Rings""/> 

Together, Anárion and Isildur were chiefly responsible for the early ordering of Gondor, and their thrones were set side by side in the Great Hall of [[Osgiliath]].  In the city of [[Minas Anor]], Anárion established his house while Isildur set up his in [[Minas Ithil]].

Sauron also survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and reentered [[Mordor]] in {{SA|3320|n}}. In {{SA|3429|n}}, Sauron attacked Gondor with a force great enough to [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|take Minas Ithil]] and force Isildur to flee. Whilst Isildur, his wife, and his sons sailed from Gondor seeking Elendil’s aid, Anárion defended Osgiliath and was able to drive his forces back into the mountains. Yet Sauron gathered greater strength and Anárion knew that without succor Gondor would fall.<ref name=""Rings""/><ref name=""SA""/>

Aid did arrive when Elendil, Isildur, and the [[Men of Arnor]], in league with the [[High King of the Noldor]], [[Gil-galad]], formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and marched south. Anárion led the [[Gondorians]] to the [[Dagorlad|plain]] between [[Cirith Gorgor]] and the [[Dead Marshes]] and fought in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] alongside the alliance. The allies entered [[Mordor]] and laid the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], but Anárion was slain by a thrown rock in {{SA|3440|n}}.<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Minas Anor]] and its attached land of [[Anórien]] were named following the heraldic meaning of his name.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>

Anárion had four children, the youngest of whom was a son, [[Meneldil]].<ref group=""note"">The records only state that Meneldil was Anárion's ""4th child""; these would either be daughters or sons who died before Meneldil succeeded his uncle.</ref> It is said that he was well-pleased at the departure of Isildur and his sons.<ref name=""Gladden""/> After the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], Meneldil became the first independent [[King of Gondor]] and the two realms in exile were estranged. 

Anárion's war-helm, which was also used as a crown, was crushed when he was killed. The war-helm of [[Isildur]] was used for the [[Crown of Gondor|crowning]] of the [[Kings of Gondor]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

The [[House of Anárion|Line of Anárion]] lasted over two thousand years, their members being known as ''Anárioni''.<ref>{{PM|VII}}, p. 196</ref> In honor of the founding co-rulers, when [[Rómendacil II]] built the [[Argonath]] he had the Pillars of the Kings carved in the likenesses of Anárion and Isildur.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Yet the male line of Anárion dwindled and finally perished when King [[Eärnur]] died childless. From that time forth the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Stewards]] ruled in the name of the House of Anárion.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Anarion.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Anárion'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Although its meaning is not glossed, it is ostensibly a compound of [[anar]] (""sun"") and the patronymic suffix [[-ion]] (""son of""), therefore having the meaning ""Son of the Sun"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3208765969.html|articlename=Q.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', in Section VII ""[[The Heirs of Elendil]]"", [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained that there were three manuscripts in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the information about the Southern Line of Gondor, and from its condition it appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily amended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Anárion's date of birth was {{SA|3209}} instead of {{SA|3219}}. It was Isildur who was born in 3219 instead of 3209 and thus Anárion was the ''older'' of Elendil's two sons.<ref name=""Elendil""/>

::Anárion is mentioned by [[Elendil]] in his advice for [[Isildur]] to let the past die. Anárion had ignored the same advice years earlier and since then, dwelled on the '''[[Andustar|Western Shores]]''' of [[Númenor]], despite there being nothing there according to Elendil. He has a sister, [[Eärien]], who was created for the show.

'''Dior''' was the son of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], and the grandson and heir to the throne of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], [[King of Doriath]]. Dior was the first of the [[Peredhil]].<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 348</ref><ref>{{PM|Ros}}, p. 369</ref> 

==History==
Dior was born on the island of [[Tol Galen]] in [[East Beleriand]].<ref name=Fifth>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> When he was 27, he married [[Nimloth of Doriath]],<ref group=note>[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth's]] parentage is uncertain. She may have been the daughter of [[Galathil]], grandson of [[Elmo]], younger brother of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]. This would make Nimloth and Dior second cousins once removed.</ref> and took her back to live by the [[Lanthir Lamath]] waterfall at the base of the [[Blue Mountains]]. There, they had three children: [[Elwing]], [[Eluréd]], and [[Elurín]]. 

After [[Thingol]] was slain by the [[Dwarves]] who coveted the [[Nauglamír]], Dior with his father and a host of [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]] journeyed swiftly north to the river [[Ascar]] and fought the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]].<ref name=Doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

In {{FA|503}}, he and his family went to [[Menegroth]] and restored the realm of [[Doriath]]. After the death of his parents, a lord of the [[Laiquendi]] came to [[Doriath]] bringing the [[Nauglamír]], which was worn by his mother. After mourning, he decided to wear it himself. When he placed the [[Nauglamír]] on himself, it sat lightly and he appeared as the fairest of three living races: [[Maiar]], [[Elves]], and [[Men]]. This news came to the [[Sons of Fëanor]], who came to [[Doriath]] with their followers, consumed by the [[Oath of Fëanor]].<ref name=Doriath/>

Dior managed to kill [[Celegorm]], and [[Caranthir]] and [[Curufin]] were also slain, but the kingdom of [[Doriath]] was destroyed. Dior and Nimloth were slain during the [[Second Kinslaying]], along with anyone trying to prevent the [[Sons of Fëanor]] from gaining the [[Silmaril]].<ref name=Doriath/> 

After the attack, the servants of [[Celegorm]] left [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]] in the forest to die. [[Elwing]], however, carrying the [[Nauglamír]], escaped with the remnant of the [[Iathrim|Elves of Doriath]] to the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=Doriath /> Years later, she would wed [[Eärendil]] and together they would seek aid from [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], the name ''Dior'' is said to mean ""successor"" in [[Doriathrin]]. The name derives from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''ndeuro'' (""follower, successor""), from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[NDEW]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 375, entry ""[[NDEW]]""</ref>

==Other names==
Dior was first called '''''Aranel''''',<ref name=Fifth>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> probably [[Sindarin]] for (""Elf King"").<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 341</ref> Later he was called '''''Eluchíl''''' (""Heir of Elu"") and '''the Fair'''.<ref name=Fifth>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===The Book of Lost Tales===

In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', a name of Dior was '''''[[Ausir (disambiguation)|Ausir]]''''' ([[Gnomish|Gn.]] ""The Wealthy"").<ref>{{LT2|V}}, pp. 240, 244, 251</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 20</ref>

===Dior's Fate===
In an older version of the ''Quenta Silmarillion'', [[Manwë]] spoke this judgment to [[Eärendil]]: 
{{blockquote|To Eärendel I remit the ban, and the peril that he took upon himself out of love for the Two Kindreds shall not fall on him; neither shall it fall upon Elwing who entered into peril for love of Eärendel: save only in this: they shall not ever walk again among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands. Now all those who have the blood of mortal Men, in whatever part, great or small, are mortal, unless other doom be granted to them; but in this matter the power of doom is given to me.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part Two: Valinor and Middle-earth before The Lord of the Rings, Quenta Silmarillion}}

[[Christopher Tolkien]] interprets it as that Dior would inherit his father's mortality, irrespective of his mother's nature and choice:<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, The Conclusion Of The Quenta Silmarillion, §9</ref>
{{blockquote|§9 It is to be observed that according to the judgement of Manwë Dior Thingol’s Heir, son of Beren, was mortal irrespective of the choice of his mother.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Part Two: Valinor and Middle-earth before The Lord of the Rings, The Conclusion Of The Quenta Silmarillion, §9}}

'''Dáin II''' or '''Dáin Ironfoot''' ([[Third Age]] 2767 – 3019, aged 252 years) was the [[Lord of the Iron Hills]] and [[King under the Mountain]]. In his life, he fought in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and the [[Battle of Dale]]. He was renowned as a warrior across Middle-earth.<ref name=""Erebor"">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

==History==
===Early life===
Dáin was born in {{TA|2767}} in the [[Iron Hills]], the son of [[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]], during the reign of his grandfather [[Grór]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref> 

===War of the Dwarves and Orcs===
[[File:Liz Danforth - Dain and Azog.png|thumb|left|200px|Liz Danforth - ''Dáin and Azog'']]
After the murder of [[Thrór]] by [[Azog]] in {{TA|2790}}, his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] swore revenge. He summoned all available Dwarves, and sacked every Orc stronghold in the [[Misty Mountains]], battling his way to [[Moria]]. There, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] raged before the gate of the ancient Dwarf stronghold. 

[[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]] and his son Dáin arrived late in the battle, but proved pivotal. Fresh and well equipped, they drove through the Orc forces, until at last Náin confronted Azog. But Náin was weary and filled with anger, and Azog strong and agile. He darted from the dwarf's blows, and when the warrior stumbled, Azog hewed and broke his neck. However, all across the valley, his troops were in retreat. He tried to escape back inside, but he was followed by Dáin who with his red axe, hewed off his head before the doors of the East-Gate. He was a very young Dwarf at thirty-two at the time, and it was heralded as a magnificent feat.

After the battle King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] wanted to enter Moria as his own. But Dáin dissuaded him, because he alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to know that it was impossible for Durin's folk to return at that time because of [[Durin's Bane]].<ref name=""Durin"" />

===Lord of the Iron Hills===
Dáin returned to the Halls of Grór with his people, and with his father dead, became [[Lord of the Iron Hills]] at his grandfather's death in {{TA|2805}}. He had one son, [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin]], born in {{TA|2866}}.<ref name=""Durin"" /> 

During his reign his people became the strongest in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], being the only realm capable to resist [[Sauron]] if he dared come North and retake the realm of [[Angmar]] and the northern passes of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=""Erebor"" />

===The Battle of Five Armies===
[[File:Angus McBride - Dain II.jpg|thumb|right|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Dáin'']]
Nearly a hundred years later, King [[Thorin]], the son of [[Thráin|Thráin II]], set out on a journey to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor, the Lonely Mountain]], which had been usurped by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]].<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> 

The dragon was slain, though by [[Bard]] of [[Lake-town]] and not by Thorin's company. Thorin claimed the entire hoard and proclaimed himself [[King under the Mountain]], but both Bard and the Elven king [[Thranduil]] longed for compensation of their suffering caused by the Dragon. Because his company of thirteen could not hold the mountain, Thorin sent for Dáin.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref> 

Dáin responded to Thorin's call and set out with more than five hundred dwarves, well armed and experienced. They were originally intent on driving off the Elves and Men, but [[Gandalf]] arrived to inform them of the approaching Orcs and [[Wargs]]. They all united against the common enemy, and so was fought the [[Battle of Five Armies]] in the valley of [[Dale]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

Thorin was killed in the battle, as were his sister-sons [[Kíli]] and [[Fíli]]. As his ""rightful heir,"" Dáin succeeded Thorin as [[King under the Mountain]], and King of all of Durin's folk.<ref name=""Durin"" /><ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===King under the Mountain===
During his reign as king, he became exceedingly rich and his people were very prosperous. The town of [[Dale]] was rebuilt and its border stretched far to the South and East and the friendship between the [[Elves of Mirkwood]], [[Men of Dale]], and [[Dwarves of Erebor]] was close, especially between the Men and Dwarves. For the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] now exceeded all their ancestors in the art of masonry and mining, and created many beautiful things in Dale.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

But not all were content. [[Balin]] set out with several others to reclaim Moria in {{TA|2989}}. Dáin did not give the expedition his blessing, and could not dissuade them.<ref name=""Council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref> It was only later learned the colony was destroyed after five years.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:Ralph Damiani - The Messenger.jpg|thumb|''Ralph Damiani'' - ""The Messenger""]]
In {{TA|3018}}, a messenger came from Mordor, enquiring about a creature named ""[[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]]"" from ""[[the Shire|Shire]]"". In return for information Dáin would be given the last three [[Dwarf-rings]]. Dáin told him to give him time to think and for many weeks he pondered until he sent [[Glóin]] and his son [[Gimli]] to [[Elrond]] for counsel, and to warn Bilbo of the enemy looking for him.<ref name=""Council"" />

[[File:Steamey - King Brand and King Dáin Ironfoot.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''King Brand and King Dáin Ironfoot'']]
After many months war came to Erebor in the [[Battle of Dale]]. King [[Brand]] of Dale was at war with [[Easterlings]] along the River [[Carnen]], but they defeated him and he retreated back to Dale where he was given aid by Dáin and an army of Dwarves.  After three days of fighting the Dwarves and Men were driven back, and Brand was slain. But defending his body stood Dáin, who at over 250 years old was not feeble, and still could wield his axe with great skill. But his skill was not enough and he was slain as well before the gates of Erebor.<ref name=""Erebor"" /> 

Several days later the Easterlings learned that the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was lost and they were afraid. When the new King [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]], son of Dáin, and Brand's son [[Bard II]] saw this they came out of the mountain and routed their enemies.<ref name=""Great"">{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Etymology and names==
{{Pronounce|Dain.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Dáinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""Deadlike"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The epithet ''[[Ironfoot]]'' remains unexplained in the published writings of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. However, [[John D. Rateliff]] has pointed out that an explanation for the epithet is likely found in the original manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', where it is stated that the shoes of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills were of iron.<ref>{{HM|RB}}, p. 674 (note 12)</ref>

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Dáin is said to come to Thorin's aid, but he is never individually identified. It's possible that he's the Dwarf who lays [[Orcrist]] on Thorin's body after he dies, as that Dwarf does not resemble any of the other 12 members of Thorin's company.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Dáin Ironfoot is played by [[Billy Connolly]].<ref name=""BBCCasting1"">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16960081|articlename=Billy Connolly lands dwarf role in The Hobbit|dated=9-Feb-2012|website=BBC|accessed=9-Feb-2012}}</ref> After the [[Elves]] of Mirkwood occupy [[Dale]], [[Thorin]] secretly sends out a raven to Dáin. The next day, just as Thranduil is about to start his attack, Dáin arrives unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] mounted on a large, armoured boar and leading an army of [[Dwarves]]. He also wields a red war hammer instead of a red axe. He tells the Elves and [[Men]] to withdraw or face his attack. After trading insults with Thranduil, the Dwarves and Elves begin attacking each other, but the [[Orcs|Orc]] Army suddenly arrives, and Dáin leads his Dwarves to attack the Orcs instead. Following their example, the Elves join the Dwarves, fighting side by side with them. When [[Thorin and Company]] charge out of the mountain, Dáin and his army rally behind them and drive back the Orcs from the mountain. Later he and Thorin embrace in the midst of the battle. His coronation as the new [[King under the Mountain]] is only shown in the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the film.

After the conclusion of the [[Siege of Erebor]], his tomb can be found in ""Mazal Akrâz"", the ""Chamber of Glory"", nearby those of [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], and his cousin [[Thorin Oakenshield]].

:A young Dáin is encountered in a flashback story of the Battle of Azanulbizar along with his father and grandfather. He is a close friend of ""Hermáth Stormhammer"", the hero from whose point of view the player experiences the battle. After slaying Azog, Dáin briefly ventures beyond the East-gate into Moria and, after recovering from the fright of seeing Durin's Bane, tells Hermáth and the player the story of the fall of Khazad-dûm.

'''Argeleb II''' ({{TA|1473}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1670|n}},<ref name=""North"">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 197) was the tenth king of [[Arthedain]].
==History==
He succeeded his father, [[Araphor]], upon his death in 1589, at the age of 116. 

According to the records of [[Gondor]], Argeleb was the [[High King]] in {{TA|1601}} when many [[hobbits]] migrated from [[Bree]]; the King granted them permission to cross the [[Bridge of Stonebows]] and to settle the land beyond the [[Baranduin]] to dwell in. He demanded in return to acknowledge his lordship, keep all bridges and roads, and speed the royal messengers.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> These hobbits were joined in [[The Shire]] by [[Stoors]] from [[Dunland]] around  {{TA|1630|n}}.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> Prior to this, the area of the Shire had been unpopulated and regarded as the king's hunting ground.

In {{TA|1636}} the [[Great Plague]] devastated [[Gondor]] (the [[Kings of Gondor|King]] [[Telemnar]], his children and the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] perished) and moved north to the lands of Argeleb's rule.<ref name=""TA""/>  Although the Great Plague decreased in severity as it moved north, there was still much suffering throughout [[Eriador]]. A remnant of the [[Dúnedain]] in Cardolan survived until the Great Plague of 1636; most of them perished, especially in [[Minhiriath]]. The [[last prince of Cardolan]] was buried in the [[Barrow-downs]]; in {{TA|1636}} evil spirits out of [[Angmar]] and [[Rhudaur]] entered into the deserted mounds and dwelt there.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, ""Fog on the Barrow-downs"", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref>

After having ruled for eighty-one years, he was succeeded by his son, [[Arvegil]], upon his death in 1670.<ref name=""North""/>

==Etymology==
See [[Argeleb I#Etymology|Argeleb I - Etymology]].

It is possible that Argeleb II was named after his great-grandfarther, [[Argeleb I]]

'''Nimloth''' was an elf-maid of [[Doriath]], the daughter of [[Galathil]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, last paragraph before the section Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn, p. 233</ref><ref name=""D"">{{WJ|Years}}, stage 'D', p. 257</ref>

==History==
In {{FA|497}},<ref name=""D"" /> she wedded [[Dior]], King [[Thingol]]'s heir, and for a time lived with him by the [[Lanthir Lamath]], a waterfall at the base of the [[Blue Mountains]]. There she gave birth to [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], her sons, and [[Elwing]] her only daughter.

After the murder of King Thingol, she returned to Doriath with her husband and became the queen of Doriath. Their reign was short-lived, however, as in [[Yule]] of {{FA|506}}<ref name=""Nim"">{{WJ|Years}}, stage 'D', manuscript 'D 2', p. 351</ref> the [[Sons of Fëanor]] [[Second Kinslaying|assaulted]] [[Menegroth]] and slew both her and Dior. Her sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were left in the forest to die by the servants of [[Celegorm]]. Elwing, however, escaped to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

==Etymology and names==
:''See: [[Nimloth (tree)#Etymology]]''
The name ''Nimloth'' is in [[Sindarin]]. It is also the same name as the name of the [[Nimloth (tree)|White Tree of Númenor]],<ref>{{UT|6e}}, fourth paragraph, p. 266</ref> which means ""White Blossom"".<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Nimloth (1)''</ref>

The earlier name '''''Lindis''''' is also in Sindarin. According to ''[[Eldamo]]'' it is composed of ''[[lind]]'' (""song"") + ''[[dîs]]'' (""bride"").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1378187557.html|articlename=S. ''Lindis'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 March 2022}}</ref>

The name '''''Elulin''''', according to ''Eldamo'', consists of the elements ''[[Elu]]'' (the Sindarin form of ''Elwë'') and ''lind'' (""song"").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-383406357.html|articlename=S.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The first time Dior's wife was mentioned in the [[legendarium]], she was named '''''Lindis'''''.<ref name=""D"" /> An alternative name, '''''Elulin''''', was given to her at roughly the same time.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 350</ref>

On the other side of a table with the descendants of Elwë (Thingol), Nimloth is the daughter of Galadhon and the 'sister of Celeborn'. It looks as if the second thought of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was that Nimloth was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Celeborn.<ref name=""D"" /> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] later writings offer an alternate ancestry for Celeborn.<ref>see ''[[Celeborn#Controversy|Celeborn]]''</ref>

'''Vairë''' was the daughter of [[Tulkastor]] and the wife of [[Lindo]], the keeper of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]].<ref>{{LT1|I}}, p. 3</ref> Her niece [[Naimi]] married a [[Men|man]] named [[Eriol|Ottor]] named by the [[Elves]] Eriol.<ref name=""Naimi"">{{LT2|VI}}, p. 290</ref>

== History ==
During the mariner [[Eriol]]'s exploration of Tol Eressëa, Eriol sought a place to rest and came across the city of [[Kortirion]], and found within, The [[Cottage of Lost Play]], with its many small windows curtained snugly, filled with a warm light. He knocked on the door as was greeted by the Lord of the Cottage, Lindo and his wife Vairë. Lindo explained that the dwelling was called Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva, or the Cottage of Lost Play and that many other elves, and mannish children of various sizes lived among them.<ref name=Cottage>{{LT1|I}}</ref>{{rp|13–4}}

Lindo and Vairë accepted Eriol's request for entrance and lodging, and invited him in. Soon after, they made their way to the great hall, where an evening meal was set out. [[Gong of the Children|Tombo]], the Gong of Children rang out and all the children of the dwelling joined them for supper, including [[Littleheart]], the Gong-warden. They sang the song of the Bringing of the Meats and Lindo blessed the food and company.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|14–6}}

During dinner, Eriol asked Lindo and Vairë about the isle of Tol Eressëa. Lindo explained Eriol had come into the region of [[Alalminórë]], or the Land of Elms at the center of the isle, which was the fairest of the realms of Tol Eressëa, and then to the city above it of Kortirion. He told of the isle's leader [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], who was a descendant of [[Ingwë|Inwë]], the King of all the Eldar when they dwelt in [[Kôr]]. At this isle is where many of the wisest and fairest of all the Eldar gathered, including Lindo's father [[Valwë]], and his wife's father [[Tulkastor]].<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|14–6}}

All but Eriol filled their cups with [[limpë]], which was a special drink that would give youth, but that only Meril-i-Turinqi could give to one who was not Eldar or that already dwelt with them. The gong sounded again, and the company moved to the [[Room of Logs]] where a magic fire burnt endlessly. There they would gather often for story time and now Vairë told him the history of the land. She spoke of [[Olórë Mallë]], or the Path of Dreams, and of a white cottage that stood in its fairest garden. None knew of what it was built or when. This was then called the Cottage of Children and the Eldar guarded it fiercely, goading the children of men to play there. This was to protect them from straying into Valinor and abandoning their parents or returning and being unsatisfied with the world ever after. After the elves left Kôr, the Cottage of Children was abandoned and blocked off forever.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|17–9}}

Meril-i-Turinqi chose Lindo and Vairë to care for the remainder of the children who had been to Kôr. The two built the new Cottage of Lost Play where the children then lived, though some would depart to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], and stay, becoming lost in the wonderous lands there. The rest return and bring stories to Lindo and Vairë.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|20}}

'''Beleram''' is one of the main characters in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. He is a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]] and joined [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] on their quest. The player can summon him to aid in fights against enemies.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[War of the Ring]] Beleram was sent by his lord, [[Gwaihir]], to search for news. While he flew over [[Fornost]] he saw an army of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] assembling. There he was taken out of the air by siege weapons and Orc [[Magic|sorcerers]], and captured.<ref name=""Main Gate"">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref>

Shortly after his capture Eradan, Andriel and Farin enter Fornost and, after killing jailers, free him. After introducing each other they make a plan to destroy siege weapons.<ref name=""Main Gate""/> Beleram attracted the attention of the Orcs and Goblins while Eradan, Andriel and Farin make their way up to the battlements and destroy the siege weapons.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Battlements''</ref> Beleram meets Eradan, Andriel and Farin again at the outer wards of the city where he thanks his new friends. In return Beleram aids them in their mission to kill [[Agandaûr]]. He also tells them that he has seen two [[Half-elves]], [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer wards''</ref>

At the Citadel of Fornost, Beleram aids Eradan, Andriel and Farin protecting Elladan and Elrohir, who try to remove the magic which protects the citadel gate. When the others go inside, Beleram remains to stop reinforcements from entering the citadel.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref> When Agandaûr attempts to flee on the back of a [[Fell beast]], Beleram pursues him. Agandaûr, however, summons a thunderstorm. A lightning hits Beleram, and he returns to the citadel tower. Here he discuss the events in Fornost with Eradan, Andriel, Farin, Elladan and Elrohir. With [[Tharzog]] - leader of the Orcs - dead and Agandaûr fled, they agree that their mission is done. Beleram returns to the [[Misty Mountains]] to inform Gwaihir.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel tower''</ref>
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - War in the North - Beleram.png|thumb|Beleram atop [[Bargrisar]] - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'']]
Beleram returned to aid the trio when they fought the [[stone-giants|stone giant]] [[Bargrisar]] in the [[Ettenmoors]]. After ripping the creature's eyes out, Beleram was joined by Gwaihir, who, after some consideration allowed Beleram to continue assisting the trio's quest. Beleram was accompanied by two fellow eagles, [[Baranthor]] and [[Armanel]].

==History==
===Life as a Lore-master===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings- War in the North - Concept Art of Andriel1.png|250px|thumb|left|Concept Art of Andriel.]]Andriel was born in [[Rivendell]], and already in her youth she was skilled in healing and [[Magic]]. [[Elrond]] taught her more about magic and lore, while [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] taught her about weapons and combat. While living in Rivendell she met [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]]. After her training was complete she was sent many times to the wilderness of [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]] by Elrond, to gather information about the world. Therefore, she has wandered much through the regions surrounding Rivendell. During these wanderings she has made contact with the [[Rangers of the North]], including [[Halbarad]] and [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]].<ref name=""Backstory Andriel""/>

In September {{TA|3018}} she [[Wandering Companies|accompenied]] [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] to the [[Emyn Beraid]], to look in the [[Elostirion-stone|Palantír]], and visit their kin in [[Lindon]]. Near [[Bree]], Andriel got a premonition that something would happen in the south. She left the company and travelled through the [[Andrath]] to [[Sarn Ford]]. There she did speak with Halbarad, who did have the same feelings and had ordered his men to make barricades.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=25 December 2011}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
When the [[Nazgûl]] attacked the guard that morning Andriel assisted the Rangers, together with Eradan and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]]. They were defeated and many of the rangers were killed. Shortly after the attack the [[Witch-king]] meets with [[Agandaûr]].

The three travelled to [[Fornost Erain]], where they freed a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]] - Beleram - and met with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], who were sent by [[Elrond|their father]] to uncover the darkness in Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref><ref name=""Inner wards"">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> Andriel, being an acquaintance of the twins, introduces her two companions and explains about their mission to stop Agandaûr's army.

'''Denethor''' was the son of [[Lenwë]], the original leader of the [[Nandor]].

== History ==
Daunted by the towering peaks of the [[Hithaeglir]], Lenwë, his son Denethor, and other [[Teleri]] forsook the [[Great March]] of the Elves to the [[Valinor|West]] and passed southward down the [[Anduin]]. Much later Denethor would lead a part of those people, the Nandor, west into [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

In the [[First Age]],<ref>{{TI|Breaking}}, p. 375, note 7</ref> centuries before the first rising of the [[Sun]], the [[Orcs]] and other foul creatures of [[Morgoth]] began to harass the Nandor east of the [[Blue Mountains]]. Hearing of the power and protection of the Elf King [[Thingol]], Denethor led many of his people over the Blue Mountains into Beleriand.  They settled in [[Ossiriand]] and Denethor became their king. They were called the ''[[Laiquendi]]'' ([[Quenya]] for ""Green-elves"").

Years later, in {{YT|1497}}, [[Morgoth]] loosed an army on Beleriand, beginning the [[First Battle of Beleriand|First Battle]] in the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars of Beleriand]].<ref>{{GA|36}}</ref> The lightly-armed Laiquendi were driven back to the great hill of [[Amon Ereb]], where Denethor was slain.<ref>{{GA|39}}</ref> While the Laiquendi survived, they became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Denethor.mp3|Ardamir}}
In an explanation of the name of [[Denethor#Etymology|Denethor II]] (who was named after this elf), the Steward of Gondor, it is stated that ''Denethor'' is [[Nandorin]] fit into the [[Sindarin]] sound range, and is said to mean ""Lithe and lank"".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 17</ref>

In the earlier ''[[The Lost Road]]'', the name Denethor is said to contain the word element ''Dani''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} entry DAN-</ref> According to ''[[The Lhammas]]'', it derives from [[Primitive Elvish]] ''Ndani-thārō'', meaning ""Saviour of the Dani"", as he was the one who led them to the West. Other derivatives of this name are: ''Daintáro'' in [[Telerin]], ''Nanisáro'' in [[Qenya]], ''Dainthor'' in [[Noldorin]] and ''Denipor'' in [[Doriathrin]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>

'''Valandil''' was the father of [[Elendil]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.

== History ==
When [[Herendil]] informed his father that though the two of them are the blood of kings, his peers called him names such as ""Terendul"" the day prior, and accused him of being a ""half-Noldo"",<ref name=P1/> [[Elendil]] responded by saying that then it may be dangerous for Herendil to be his son as his own father's name, Valandil, meant ''""God-friend""''.<ref name=P1>{{LR|P1III2}}</ref>

Later. Elendil tells his son that he cannot be corrupted by the servants of [[Morgoth]] due to being Valandil his father being the ""chief of the wise men of [[Númenor]].<ref name=P1/>

== Etymology ==
''Valandil'' is [[Quenya]], being a compound of ''vanan'' (""god"") + ''(-n)dil'' (""friend""). Its [[Old English]] cognate was ''[[Oswin Errol|Oswine]]'', which also means ""God-friend"".<ref>{{LR|P1III1}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In another stage of the [[Legendarium]] separate from ''[[The Lost Road]]'', Valandil was the brother of [[Elendil]] the Tall. In this stage, Valandil had the role of [[Anarion]] and founded [[Gondor|Ondor]].<ref>{{LR|P1II4}}, pp. 33-4</ref>

{{quote|Now there happened that night to be present a guest both at their board and at their tale telling, and his name was Gilfanon|''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', ""[[The Tale of the Sun and Moon]]""}}

'''Gilfanon a·Davrobel''' was one of the oldest [[Elves]] on [[Tol Eressëa]]. It was he who told [[Eriol]] the tale of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] in the [[Cottage of Lost Play]].<ref name=Sun>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>{{rp|174 ff}} 

Gilfanon lived in the [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]] in [[Tavrobel]].<ref name=Sun>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>{{rp|175}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
His earlier name was '''''Ailios''''', that was mostly amended in the manuscript of the Tale of the Sun and Moon,<ref>{{LT1|VIIIn}}, p. 197, note 19</ref> but remains in the (earlier) tales given in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, passim, see ''Index''</ref>

According to an outline, Gilfanon bids Eriol to write down all the tales that he has heard in Tol Eressëa before drinking [[limpë]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 283</ref> Christopher explains that this and all the details about Gilfanon (like being one of the [[Noldoli]]) match with [[Pengolodh]], so Gilfanon would be his literary origin.<ref>{{SM|VC}}, p. 274</ref>

In a [[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales|prose fragment following the Lost Tales]], there is a [[Gilfanon (elf of Alqaluntë)|Gilfanon]] mentioned as an Elf of [[Alqaluntë]], but Christopher is certain that he cannot be the Gilfanon of [[Tavrobel]], so probably Tolkien had changed his name.<ref>{{SM|P3}}, pp. 9-10</ref>

{{Quote|But Ingwë was ever held the High King of all the Elves.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië]]""}}

'''Ingwë''' was the King of the [[Vanyar]], and the High King of the Elves.<ref name=""princes"" /> 

==History==
Ingwë was one of the [[Minyar]] born at [[Cuiviénen]]. He was the eldest son of [[Ilion]], and a descendant of [[Imin]] and [[Iminyë]], from eldest son to eldest son. He was beloved by his people, and at some point before the [[Great Journey]] he wed [[Ilwen]] and had several children at Cuiviénen by the time [[Oromë]] found the [[Quendi]].<ref name=""Gol"">{{NM|P1xvii}}, pp. 127-128</ref> 

When Oromë invited them to [[Aman]], Ingwë, along with [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë Singollo|Elwë]], were the most eager to visit, and so followed him as ambassadors and travelled to the Blessed Realm. Once there, Ingwë desired to ""dwell in the presence of Varda"", and was reluctant to return to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""Ard"" />

When they returned, they held a [[Debate of the Quendi|great debate]], and told their peoples about its beauty and bliss and became their leaders during the [[Great March]]. Ingwë was the leader of the [[Vanyar]], the foremost of the clans to follow Oromë, who were the most eager to reach the [[West]], which they did quickly.<ref name=""journey"">{{S|3}}</ref>

After the [[Great Journey]], Ingwë never returned or set eyes upon [[Middle-earth]] again.<ref name=""journey"">{{S|3}}</ref>

He lived in [[Tirion]] for a while, where he also built the great, white tower at the topmost part of the city, called [[Mindon Eldaliéva]] or the Tower of Ingwë. It was never used, except by those who tended to the lamp at its summit.<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}, p. 173</ref><ref group=""note"">This detail is only found in ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' and the ''Lhammas'' from the 1930s.</ref>

There he begot many children, as noted by Finwë when Finwë complained to the Valar about his widowhood.<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 206</ref>

At some point, however, he went to live on [[Taniquetil]] at the feet of [[Manwë]].<ref name=""princes"">{{S|5}}</ref>

[[Indis]], the second wife of [[Finwë]], was of his close kin.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Ingwë is described as being tall and beautiful,<ref name=""Gol"" /> and his hair as golden and curly.<ref name=""Cur"" /> He is also said to have been ""more given to thought than arts"".<ref name=""Gol"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Ingwe.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Ingwë'' is in [[Quenya]]. It means ""chief"", being derived from the root [[ING]] (""highest"", ""top""), to which is attached the suffix ''[[-wë]]'' (""person"").<ref name=""Shib"">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|340}}<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2208467609.html|articlename=Q. ''Ingwë'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=20 April 2022}}</ref>

The Vanyar called themselves the ''Ingwer'', the chieftains, on account of being considered the leaders and principal kindred of the Eldar, and their king's proper title was '''''Ingwë Ingweron''''': ‘chief of the chieftains’.<ref name=""Shib""/>{{rp|340}}

In the earlier [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], ''Ingwë'' is said to be a compound of ''[[inga|ing]]'' (""first"") + the ending ''[[-wë|-we]]'' (""man"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""ING"", ""WEG""</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early legendarium===
In the early version of the [[legendarium]], according to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the character that would later become known as ''Ingwë'' was called '''Inwë'''.<ref name=""Com"">{{LT1|In}}, p. 26</ref>

Inwë was one of the three Elves (the other two being [[Finwë]] and [[Tinwë]]) that volunteered to go with [[Nornorë]], the messenger of the [[Valar]], to [[Valinor]], after their discovery at [[Koivië-néni]] - for [[Manwë]] wished to learn about their ""coming"" and their ""desires"".<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 115</ref>

When Inwë arrived to Valinor, he was filled with wonder and longing for the light of [[Laurelin]], one of the [[Two Trees]], and his words moved [[Yavanna]] and [[Vána]] so that they convinced most of the other Valar to summon the Elves to Valinor to live amongst them. So Inwë and the other ambassadors were sent back to Koivië-néni, and managed to convince most of the Elves to come live with the Valar.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 116-8</ref>

Thereafter, Inwë became the leader of the [[Vanyar|Teleri]], the first clan of the Elves, and led them to Valinor. He was also regarded as the eldest<ref name=""Dea"">{{LT1|V}}, p. 129</ref> and greatest<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 116</ref> of all the Elves, and afterwards was considered the King of all the Eldar,<ref name=""Gil"">{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref> and his home was at the highest point in [[Kôr]], a great elven city in Valinor, which had a [[Mindon Eldaliéva#Other versions of the legendarium|silver tower]] ""shooting skyward like a needle"".<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 122</ref> The Valar also gave Inwë a seedling of one of the Two Trees, which ""blossomed eternally without abating"" in his court.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 123</ref>

Many years later, after the [[fall of Gondolin]], the Elves of [[Kôr]] heard of the plight of the [[Gnomes]] who were enslaved by [[Melko]], and against the wishes of the Valar, Inwë led them to the [[Great Lands]] to wage war against Melko.

And even though the Elves were victorious, and Melko defeated and bound by [[Tulkas]], Inwë was, however, killed during the war.<ref name=""Dea"" />

After the war, with the Elves being forbidden to return to Valinor,<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''3''', p. 280</ref> Ingil his son led them from the Great Lands to [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle, where he became their leader.<ref name=""Gil"" />

His kin and descendants were called the [[Inwir]], one of whom was [[Meril-i-Turinqi]] his great-granddaughter,<ref name=""Dea"" /> the Lady of Tol Eressëa at the time of the arrival of [[Eriol]] the Mariner, in c. [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]].<ref name=""Com"" />

In one outline, the island of Tol Eressëa was also called ''[[Inwinórë]]'' after Inwë, but that was later changed to ''[[Ingilnórë]]'', in honour of his son Ingil instead.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xiii</ref> 

Inwë might have spoken [[Inwelin]], a dialect of [[Telellin]] spoken by the royal clan of Inwir.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 2</ref> 

====Ingwë of Luthany====
In later outlines of the ''Book of Lost Tales'', in which Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with England, the island of [[Luthany]] appears as a precursor to England, from which the Elves of the Great Lands sail ''to'' Tol Eressëa, now a separate island.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>

In that conception of the legendarium, there appears a character called Ing or Ingwë, a [[Men|Mannish]] King of Luthany who helps and welcomes the Elves to his land, after their war with Melko and, afterwards, with unfriendly Men in the Great Lands.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''18''', pp. 302-3</ref>

However, he is ''not'' to be identified with the character of Inwë, or that of Ingwë in the later legendarium, even though [[Christopher Tolkien]] feels there has to be some connection between the two characters.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''21''', pp. 304-5</ref>

====Early etymology====
The name ''Inwë'' is in [[Qenya]]. In the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', it is said to be derived from the root [[INI]] (""small""),<ref name=""Ing"">{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 256</ref> but the earlier, original gloss of the root was ""[[fairy]]"".<ref>{{PE|12}}, pp. 42-3</ref>

====Other names====
The [[Gnomish]] cognate of ''Inwë'' is '''''Inwithiel''''',<ref name=""Gil"" /> changed from '''''Gim Githil'''''.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, Changes made to names in ''The Cottage of Lost Play'', p. 22</ref>

His proper (Gnomish) name, according to the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' was '''''Inweg''''' or '''''Im''''', with '''''Githil''''' being the Gnomish cognate of '''''Isil''''', another one of his names.<ref name=""Ing"" /> '''''Githiel''''' was the poetic form of ''Githil''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 39</ref>

The original Gnomish form of his name was '''''Ginweg''''', later changed to '''''Gim''''' or ''Githil''.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xx</ref>

He was also called '''''Tur yan Eldaron''''', meaning ""King of the Elves"" in Qenya, with '''''Tur nan Églathon''''' being its Gnomish equivalent.<ref>{{PE|15}}, ""[[Names and Required Alterations]]"", ''Appendix'', ''Text VIII'', p. 16</ref>

In the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'', from c. [[1926]], the name '''''Ing''''' is described as being the Gnomish form of ''Ingwë'', as opposed to the earlier conception of ''Ing'' being a rejected Qenya form of ''Inwë''.<ref>{{SM|2a}}, p. 44</ref>

====''Quenta Noldorinwa'' and the ''Lhammas''====
In the ''[[Lhammas]]'', a text from the 1930s, Ingwë is mentioned as one of the original, and the eldest, of the Elves to be [[Awakening of the Elves|awakened]] at [[Cuiviénen]], and who led his people, chief of whom were known as the ''Ingwelindar'' or ''Ingwi'', to [[Aman]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}, p. 171</ref>

In the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' from c. [[1930]], he was still supposed to be one of the leaders of the Eldar in the [[War of Wrath]] (unlike in the later versions, where it was his son Ingwion who led them), and he was still supposed to die in that war, as in the early legendarium in the ''Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{SM|CQ2}}, p. 168</ref>

====The Three Ambassadors====
Ingwe was mentioned in several texts which were eventually published in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''. As in the published ''Silmarillion'' several of them describe him, as one of the [[Three Ambassadors]], going to Aman and witnessing its splendor.

According to one text, the ambassadors, after their return to Middle-earth, spoke to the Elves at Cuiviénen. There, Ingwë spoke with great reverence towards the three [[Elf-fathers]], regretting the fact that they themselves were unwilling to go and visit Aman, but he nonetheless asked Oromë whether or not they might still go there, and judge for themselves whether or not the Elves should embark on the [[Great Journey]] - unfortunately, the three Elf-fathers were unwilling to go.

In another text, [[Tolkien]] changed his mind about the nature of the three ambassadors, and instead proposed that [[Imin]], [[Tata]] and [[Enel]], the three Elf-fathers, ought to become the three ambassadors to Aman, with Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë accompanying them as the representatives of the younger generations of the Elves.

There, the three (new) ambassadors were undecided, and therefore, the Elves of Cuiviénen asked their younger associates to speak. Here Ingwë, again, spoke with reverence towards Imin, Tata and Enel, and ultimately agreed with Imin in his desire for the beauty of Valinor.

Finally, Imin agreed to a vote, and about two thirds of the Elves gathered at the time agreed to go to Aman.<ref name=""Ard"">{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 96-98</ref>

{{Quote|He is the keeper of the [[Halls of Mandos|Houses of the Dead]], and the summoner of the spirits of the slain. He forgets nothing; and he knows all things that shall be, save only those that lie still in the freedom of [[Ilúvatar]]. He is the Doomsman of the [[Valar]].|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar""}}

'''Mandos''' was the '''Doomsman of the Valar''' who pronounced judgement in matters of fate. He was the keeper of the slain in his [[Halls of Mandos|Halls]] in the west of [[Valinor]]. 

His actual, less common name was '''''Námo'''''. He was the ""elder brother"" of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Irmo]] (also called ''Lórien''). He is one of the [[Aratar]]. Together, Mandos and Irmo are called the [[Fëanturi]] ([[Quenya|Q]]: ""Masters of Spirits""). Their sister is [[Nienna]]. [[Vairë]] the Weaver is his wife. 

==Attributes==
He keeps the [[Halls of Mandos]] where he summons the spirits of the slain. For this he is also known as ""Mandos"" after his dwelling place.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> 

Mandos knows and remembers nearly all things that were and shall be. He serves as the Doomsman of the Valar, he pronounces his judgements at the bidding of [[Manwë]]. However only [[Ilúvatar]] knows with full certainty what the full doom of Arda will be, and he will not reveal it all, even to Mandos or Manwë.<ref name=vala/> Mandos and Manwë have always been allied since their entering into [[Eä]], and together they understand most clearly the [[Vision of Ilúvatar]] more than any of the other Valar.
 
Mandos is said to be the grimmest of the Valar. However, this in no way implies that Mandos is dark or evil.  His grimness is wholly part of his nature, coming (one must assume) from that part of the mind of [[Ilúvatar]] from which he came. Neither is Mandos willful or malevolent in declaring the fates of [[Arda]].

==History==
During one of the early councils of the Valar, the Powers worried that the [[Elves]] would come in darkness. Manwë bid Mandos to speak, and he revealed that the age of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] approached and it was the doom of the [[Elves]] to wake under the [[stars]] and revere [[Varda]]. This prompted Varda to prepare new stars for the [[Awakening of the Elves]].<ref name=""Coming"">{{S|3}}</ref>

After [[Morgoth|Melkor]] was overthrown in the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Valar debated on whether to summon the [[Elves]] to [[Aman]]. Though some such as [[Ulmo]] felt the Elves should be left to dwell in Middle-earth, the Valar decided to summon the Elves. At this, Mandos broke his silence with the words ""So it is doomed"".<ref name=""Coming""/>

When the unrest of the Noldor began and Fëanor drew sword upon Fingolfin, Mandos was present at the council when Fëanor was interrogated for his actions. Though it was revealed that Melkor had sown the seed of dissent, Mandos would not allow Fëanor's haughty actions to go unpunished. Therefore he banished Fëanor from Tirion for 12 years, only allowing him to return if one should release him. At which point, Fingolfin offered to do so.

But after Melkor slew the Trees of Valinor and stole the Silmarils, Fëanor was overcome with rage and led the [[Noldor]] in rebellion against the Valar. Driven by their Oath, Fëanor's host carried out the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]] in the lands of [[Araman]] north of Valinor. For this act Mandos, or one of his servants, pronounced the [[Doom of Mandos]], a warning if they continued in their rebellion. This caused [[Finarfin]] to repent and return to [[Eldamar]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> The curse of Mandos remained upon all the Noldor, tied to the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and thwarting the Noldor in all the [[Wars of Beleriand]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos'']]
When [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] died, she sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of Mandos. Deeming that this matter was beyond him, yet unable to reverse the fates, Mandos sought the counsel of Manwë. In turn, Manwë gave him the response from Ilúvatar. Mandos returned to Lúthien and gave her a choice; to remain in Valinor forever and forget all her griefs, or to return with Beren to Middle-earth as a mortal. Luthien chose the latter, forsaking her immortality. So Beren was returned to a second life and Lúthien was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to [[Middle-earth]] with him.

After, when [[Eärendil]] set foot in [[Aman]] and begged the Valar for the forgiveness of the [[Noldor]] and help in their war with [[Morgoth]], he was the one who demanded he be executed for no mortal should set foot in Aman and live. But [[Ulmo]] spoke against him, asking whether he was the son of [[Tuor]] of the [[Edain]] or [[Idril]] of the Noldor. Mandos responded that in either case, since the Noldor are still under the ban, he should not live. Regardless of that, [[Manwë]] answered his prayer and commanded the [[Host of the Valar]] be assembled and wage war on Morgoth. Considering Eärendil's doom, along with [[Elwing]]'s, his wife, he offered them and their children a choice: whether to be counted among [[Elves]] or [[Men]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> After the [[War of Wrath]], the exiled Noldor were forgiven and the Curse of Mandos was ended.

==Etymology==
''Námo'' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈnaːmo]}}) in [[Quenya]] means ""Judge"" or ""Ordainer"",<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> from [[root]] [[NAM]].

''Mandos'' ({{IPA|[ˈmandos]}}) is a [[Quenya]] name meaning ""Castle of Custody"".<ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 350</ref> It derived from the early Elvish ''Mandostŏ''.<ref>{{VT|39a}}, p. 6</ref> 

In the previous ''[[Etymologies]]'', ''Mandos'' was translated as ""Imprisoner, Binder"", derived from [[root]] [[MBAD]]. Note that here, ''Mando'' was envisioned as the actual name of the Vala proper (not his realm). In that conception, the form ''Mand-os'' (from ''Mand-osse'') is a ""lengthened"" form  meaning ""''Dread'' Imprisoner"".<ref name=Etymologies>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""MBAD-""</ref> The [[Noldorin]] names for ''Mandos'' were '''''Bannos''''' (""Dread Imprisoner"""") and '''''Badhor'''''/'''''Badhron''''' (""judge"").<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 33</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Mandos is referred as ''Nefrea'' ""Corpse-ruler"" and ''neoaerna hlaford'' ""master of the houses  of  the  dead"".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that in the early version of the [[Legendarium]] Mandos does exclaim prophecies, but he doesn't function as the ""Doomsman of the Valar"" as in the later ''[[Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=lt13n>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref> His wife was [[Nienna#Other versions of the Legendarium|Fui Nienna]] and he had a [[hound]] named [[Gorgumoth]].

In the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'' the Vala in [[Qenya]] was called Ve or Vefantur Mandos. In the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' his [[Gnomish]] names are Bannoth Gwi, Gwi-fanthor and Gwivannoth. His personal name(s) ''Ve''/''Gwi'' are said to derive from a primitive [[root]] VEHE, but no meaning or translation are given.<ref name=ltapp/> 

''Mandos'' is the Qenya name of the region and their Halls, also known as ''Ve'' after him. The Gnomish form ''Bannoth'' also refers to the Vala and the region of the souls, but also improperly his Halls (properly ''Gwi'' or ''Ingwi'').<ref name=ltapp>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

An epithet of Mandos was '''''Morimando''''' (""Dark Mando""), being the dark counterpart of Manwë ''Kalamando'' (""Light Mando""). Tolkien notes that in those epithets, the element ''man'' loses its sense as ""doom, prison"", and is understood as the root referring to ""holiness"" (root MAN in ''Man''we).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry MBAD</ref>

==Inspiration==
Mandos is comparable to gods of the dead of real world mythologies, like Hades or Hel. The instance of Lúthien singing to him in order to release her beloved, is reminiscent of similar ancient tales, such as Orpheus singing to Hades to release Eurydice, or Hermod who asks Hel to release Baldur.<ref>{{webcite|author=Dawn Felagund|articleurl=http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/references/pf/namo2.php|articlename=Námo Mandos|website=[http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org Silmarillion Writers Guild]}}</ref> (The story of Orpheus has been retold in English literature as ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'').

Another similarity shared between Mandos and the two mythological figures, is that they bear the name of their realms. Mandos in the early writings had a hound, [[Gorgumoth]], while Hades was guarded by the monstrous dog Cerberus and Hel by the dog or wolf Garmr.

'''Littleheart''' was the [[Elf|Elven]] Gong-warden at the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] where he rang Tombo, the [[Gong of the Children]], once to summon dwellers for meals, and three times to summon them for the telling of tales. He had previously travelled with [[Eärendel]] in the [[Wingilot]] on his last voyage to [[Kôr]], and it was the ringing of Tombo which awoke the [[Sleeper]] in the [[Tower of Pearl]].<ref>{{LT1|I}},pp. 23-24</ref>

'''Naugladur''' was the king of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
He led the [[battle in the Thousand Caves|attack]] against [[Menegroth]] to capture the [[Nauglafring]]. Later he fought with [[Beren]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] and would have slain him, but stumbled and Beren slew him to reclaim the Nauglafring.  With his dying words he cursed the treasure that he was bringing back to Nogrod, which Beren dumped in the river.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

The name ''Naugladur'' was never explained by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], but it is likely a [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]] name meaning ""King [of the] Dwarves"".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D.

'''Melian''' the [[Maia]] was the wife of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], mother of [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]], and '''Queen of [[Doriath]]'''. 

==Attributes==
Melian served [[Vána]] and [[Estë]]. She was said to be akin to [[Yavanna]] the Valië. She is associated with songbirds, and it is said she taught [[nightingales]] how to sing and their music followed her paces. In [[Valinor]], she dwelt in the [[Lórien (Valinor)|Gardens of Lórien]] tending its trees, and she was the most beautiful, wise and skilled in songs of enchantment of all the people of [[Irmo]]. However, she journeyed often to [[Middle-earth]] for she loved the deep shadows of trees and forests.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref><ref name=Thingol>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

==History==
In the dawn of [[Arda]] Melian dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien, and taught the [[nightingales]] how to sing. When the lights of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] mingled, at noon, she sang in Lórien, and it is said that everything stopped, even the bells and fountains of [[Valimar]], to enjoy her voice.<ref name=Thingol/>

Around the time of the [[Awakening of the Elves]], Melian left Valinor after a warning in a dream.<ref name=dream>{{NM|P1xiii}}</ref> Melian's love for the trees brought her to [[Middle-earth]], filling its silence with her and her birds' voices.<ref name=Thingol/> After [[Oromë]] found the [[Elves]] in [[Cuiviénen]], the [[Valar]] planned to make [[Battle of the Powers|War]] against [[Melkor]]<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> and during their preparations, they sent Melian to Cuiviénen, and then [[Five Guardians|a group]] of great Maiar to guard the Elves. Melian was their leader, the only female spirit among them.<ref name=Five>{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 95 & 99</ref>
[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Melian and Thingol.jpg|thumb|left|''Melian and Thingol'' by [[Kip Rasmussen]]]]
When the [[Eldar]] [[Great March|marched]] into the [[Aman|West]], in the woods of [[Nan Elmoth]], Melian came upon [[Thingol|Elwë Singollo]] of the people of the [[Teleri]]. Elwë was entranced and fell into a swoon at the sight of the Maia Melian, and the two of them stood hand in hand, unable to move or speak for years while the trees grew around them. As a result of his absence, a portion of his followers stayed behind to search for him, while the rest continued on to Valinor under the kingship of [[Olwë]], brother of Elwë.<ref name=Thingol/> 

Melian and Thingol recovered and gathered the Elves who stayed behind to look for Elwë, who were named [[Eglath]]. They founded the kingdom of [[Doriath|Eglador]] and ruled as King and Queen of all the Elves in [[Beleriand]]. Melian was the only known [[Ainur|Ainu]] who coupled with one of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and thus she begot a child, the daughter named Lúthien, who was the fairest of the Children to have ever lived.<ref name=Thingol/> She married the Man [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], and as a result, Melian's blood of the Maiar was passed on to both [[Elves]] and [[Men]].<ref name=Quest>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Foreseeing that war was coming to Beleriand, Melian warned her husband Thingol. In turn, Thingol ordered the delving of a strong fortress in their kingdom. This was [[Menegroth]], the Thousand Caves, and they were aided by the Dwarves. With the return of Morgoth and the flight of [[Ungoliant]] from his [[Balrogs]], the dark spider tried to enter into Thingol's domain, but Melian alone repelled Ungoliant and drove her away.
[[File:Donato Giancola - Beren and Luthien in the Court of Thingol and Melian.jpeg|thumb|''Beren and Lúthien in the Court of Thingol and Melian'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]
When war with the Great Enemy, [[Morgoth]], [[First Battle|came at last]] to their land, she used her powers to guard and defend it with a protection called ''List Melian'', or ""the [[Girdle of Melian]]"", and their kingdom was known as [[Doriath]], the Land of the Fence. This prevented anyone less powerful than Melian from entering the kingdom.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> However, with the foresight of a Maia, she predicted that one day someone more powerful would be able to enter. When Beren arrived as foretold, she counselled King Thingol against sending Beren to search for a [[Silmaril]], which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. This was one of many instances in which she proved, through her wisdom and powers of foresight, to be wiser than her husband, and an effective queen of her land. The great evil wolf [[Carcharoth]] also passed the Girdle, as fate and the power of the Silmaril let him.<ref name=Quest/>

In Doriath, she also became a friend and tutor of [[Galadriel]] to whom she taught great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth and also the art of [[lembas]]-baking which she knew from her mistress, Yavanna. She eventually questioned Galadriel on how and why the [[Noldor]] had returned, upon which Galadriel told her only some of the story. Therefore she was the first to glean [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|the truth]], perceiving more than Galadriel was willing to tell, and she warned Thingol against dealing with the [[Sons of Fëanor]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> After the departure of Lúthien and Beren, she aided [[Túrin]] and his [[Morwen|mother]] and [[Niënor|sister]]. She provided [[Beleg]] with some way-bread, lembas, for him and the exiled Túrin, showing great favour because never before was lembas given to a Man and seldom was it again. But she also foresaw his doom in his quest for Túrin.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> When [[Húrin]], father of [[Túrin]], returned from his captivity in [[Angband]], she was the one to lift the dark spell of Morgoth from him.

Thingol's arrogance eventually resulted in his death during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]]. Melian then departed from the mortal lands,<ref>{{NM|P1iv}}</ref> vanishing to Valinor, where she mourned the loss of her husband in the [[Halls of Mandos]] and her daughter to the unknown fate of the [[Gift of Men]]. In her absence, Doriath was opened to its enemies, which led to its ultimate demise.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Melian.mp3|Gilgamesh}}

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
She appeared in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' as ''Tindriel'' or ''Wendelin'' ([[Qenya]]) and in a [[Gnomish]] dictionary as ''Gwendeling'' or ''Gwendhiling''. In a crossed out note, she had with [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] a son, [[Tinfang Warble|Tinfang]], and a daughter, [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]].<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref><ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Wendelin""</ref>

In the early [[legendarium]] Melian is defined as a fay, making her somewhat more sinister than in her later appearance. This version of her is presented in '''The Tale of Tinúviel''', Tolkien's first story of Beren and Lúthien, which was written in archaic English and published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. In this work she appears in another later narrative, although her character is portrayed as being far weaker and more frail than Melian's final manifestation. She also appeared under several names, such as '''Gwenniel'''.

[[Vëannë]] and [[Ausir (boy)|Ausir]] argued whether she should be called ''Wendelin'' or ''Gwendeling''. In a slightly later version, the name ''Melian'' appeared. In one variant she was a daughter of [[Irmo|Lórien]]. She was found by [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] while listening to the song of nightingales and ran away with laughter when he tried to touch her hair. Then he fell into a deep slumber, and she kept watch over him while he slept. Later she became his wife and the queen of [[Doriath|Artanor]].<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] noticed that in this early version her protection was weaker and there was the possibility that enemies would follow the returning Beren and Tinúviel.<ref>{{LT2|In}}, § 2. ''People and lands in the Tale of Tinúviel''<!-- Please check my retranslation from Polish --></ref>

'''Tilion''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtili.on]}}) was a [[Maiar|Maia]] who guided the [[Moon]].

==History==
In the days of the trees in [[Valinor]], Tilion had been a hunter from the company of [[Oromë]]. Though he often rode with Oromë, he spent much of his free time in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]], under the light of [[Telperion]]. Tilion loved silver (he even used a silver [[bow]]), and he begged to be given the care of the [[Moon]]. The [[Valar]] gave him the task. He was said to be less mighty than [[Arien]], the Maia chosen to guide the [[Sun]].

Tilion was reckless at times, and did not always follow the correct path, causing the Moon to be at times in the sky at the same time as the Sun, or not appear at all.

He was also drawn by the splendour of Arien, and sought to come near her, though ""the flame of Anar scorched him, and the island of the Moon was darkened"".

[[Morgoth]], who hated the new lights, sent [[spirits of shadows]] against Tilion, but Tilion vanquished them in a strife in [[Ilmen]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name means ""the Horned"", containing the [[root]] [[TIL]] plus the masculine ending [[-ion]].<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>

'''Théodred''' ({{TA|2978}}-{{TA|3019|n}}) was the only son and heir of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]] who died in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Théodred was born to King [[Théoden]] and [[Elfhild]], who died in childbirth. Because of his state as prince of Rohan, Théodred also held the title of [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]]. 

While [[Gríma]] gained more influence on the King, he considered Théodred and [[Éomer]] his chief opponents, and tried to bring the two cousins into discredit with Théoden. But their loyalty remained steadfast even in his apparent dotage; Gríma therefore tried to play them one against the other in the mind of Théoden, representing Éomer as ever eager to increase his authority, at the expense of Théodred.<ref name="":0"">{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

In the beginning of {{TA|3019|n}}, due to the threat of invasion by the forces of the wizard [[Saruman]], Théodred established himself at [[Helm's Deep]] to command the military strength of the [[Westfold]]. When actual war began, Théodred added to the Muster of Westfold by summoning the [[Muster of Edoras]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>

Meanwhile, Saruman planned to have the Prince killed. He sent forces against Rohan on [[February 25]], {{TA|3019}} with explicit orders to kill the Second Marshal at all costs. 

Théodred was warned by his scouts of a mustering of troops at the [[Gate of Isengard]] and he reinforced the approaches. He passed over the [[Isen]] with the main strength of his cavalry to overthrow Saruman's apparent army before it was fully prepared. He scattered the vanguard, but then discovered the main host prepared for assault and ordered a retreat while the rearguard under [[Grimbold]] had to turn and drive back their pursuers.<ref name="":0"" />

Retreating, he appointed Grimbold in command of the western bank garrison while he himself attempted to man the eyot in the midst of the river. Then a van came and with unexpected speed soon took control of the eastern end of the fords; the fiercest of Saruman's warriors and [[Goblin-men|Orc-men]] abandoned the rest of the battle and directed their full might around the Prince. As Grimbold came to his defence, Théodred was hewn down by a great orc-man, whom Grimbold slew.

[[Elfhelm]] arrived to his support and they lifted the body. Théodred still breathed, only long enough to speak his last words. The news of Théodred's death caused [[Erkenbrand]] of [[Westfold]] to assume command of the [[West-mark]].<ref name="":0"" /> With no descendants or siblings, this made his cousin, [[Éomer]], heir to the throne of Rohan.

It is told that Grimbold set up on stakes all about the mentioned eyot in the [[Fords of Isen]] the heads of the axemen that had been slain there, and, above the hasty mound of Théodred in the middle, set his banner.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Note 8.</ref>

== Etymology ==
'''Théodred''' is probably a combination of the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ''þēod'' (""people"", ""land"") and ''rǣd'' (""counsel"", ""advice"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 403</ref> The word ''þēod'' also appears in the name [[Éothéod]].<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 36</ref>

'''[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Théodred, who was played by [[Paris Howe Strewe]], is portrayed younger than he was in the books. His death is a major event early in the movie, whereas, in the book, it has all happened one week before the [[Three Hunters]] come to Edoras.
:Differently from the books, in which Théodred is buried by Grimbold in a hasty mound in an eyot in the Fords of Isen, in the movie he is brought heavily wounded albeit barely alive to Edoras and tended by [[Éowyn]] before dying. His burial, just outside of Edoras, is shown in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|extended edition]].

'''[[2011]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard]]'':'''
: Théodred's age is more accurate to the book. He is betrothed to Ingyth, daughter of the Reeve of the [[Entwash Vale]] and the sister of [[Horn (rider of Rohan)|Horn]]. While his riders defend the [[Fords of Isen]] against the [[Dunlendings]], the Prince leads a small party into [[Dunland]] to scout for potential threats, where they encounter the [[Grey Company]] led by [[Halbarad]]. After helping the Rangers, Théodred returns to the [[Gap of Rohan]] where he sets up a daring plan to attack [[Isengard]]. The [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] happens much as described in the book, with the player fighting side-by-side with [[Grimbold]] as they carve a path through the [[Uruk]]s to reach the Prince, only to arrive too late. His sword is recovered by [[Elfhelm]] and is subsequently used by [[Éowyn]] in her confrontation with the [[Witch-King]].

{{quote|I am Tuor son of Huor of the House of Hador and the kindred of Húrin, and these names, I am told, are not unknown in the Hidden Kingdom.|Tuor to [[Elemmakil]] in ''[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]''}}

'''Tuor Eladar''' was a hero of the [[Edain]] in the last years of the [[First Age]] and the father of [[Eärendil]]. In spite of being a Man, he was chosen by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]] to be the last hope of the [[Noldor]] in the face of annihilation by the forces of [[Morgoth]].

Born in the winter of the [[Year of Lamentation]], Tuor's life coincided with the final defeat of the Edain and the Noldor-in-Exile by the forces of Morgoth. He was of the [[House of Hador]], but after the deaths of his parents [[Huor]] and [[Rían]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], he was fostered by the surviving [[Elves of Mithrim]]. He passed his youth a refugee and an outlaw, before being guided by the Vala Ulmo to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]]. There he rose high in the favour of the [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Turgon]] and wedded the elf-maiden [[Idril]], the King's daughter. Escaping the [[Fall of Gondolin]], he and his family came to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. After abiding there long enough to see Eärendil to manhood, Tuor finally succumbed to his [[sea-longing]] and, with Idril, departed [[Middle-earth]] for the [[Aman|West]]. The tradition of the Noldor was that he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the [[Elves|elder kindred]] and will share with them an immortal life in [[Valinor]] as long as [[Arda]] will endure.<ref name=""S23"">{{S|23}}</ref><ref name=""Letter153"">{{L|153}}</ref>

==Family and heritage==
His father Huor and his elder brother [[Húrin]] were fostered with their kin in [[Brethil]]. They were of the House of Hador, but also descended from the [[House of Haleth]] through their mother [[Hareth]]. During a battle following the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the brothers escaped the hordes of Morgoth with the aid of Ulmo, and [[Thorondor]] brought them to Gondolin. Ulmo counselled King Turgon to treat them as guests, as help would come to him from their House. After they learnt much from the [[Gondolindrim]], Turgon reluctantly waived his law and let them leave on a condition of silence.<ref name=""RuinOfBeleriand"">{{S|18}}</ref>

On his return, Huor married Rían of the [[House of Bëor]]. Thus Tuor was a descendant of all the Three Houses of the Edain. When Tuor was conceived, Huor gave him his name before he was born. Months later Huor fell in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] defending the retreat of Turgon, speaking his last words to the Elven King: ""...out of your house shall come the hope of Elves and Men... from you and from me a new [[Star of Eärendil|star]] shall arise"".<ref>{{CH|2}}, p. 58</ref>

==History==
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Fostering of Tuor.jpg|thumb|''The Fostering of Tuor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
After hearing news of the battle, Rían became distraught and left [[Dor-lómin]] to wander alone in the wild. She was rescued by the [[Sindar]] of [[Mithrim]] who took her to their dwelling in the [[Mountains of Mithrim|mountains]]. Before the end of the year Tuor was born and was given to the [[Elves of Mithrim]] to be fostered. Rían, having heard from [[Annael]], the leader of the Elves, the news of Huor's death, made her way to [[Haudh-en-Ndengin]], where she laid down in grief and died.<ref name=""TurinTurambar"">{{S|21}}</ref>

Soon after, [[Hithlum]] was occupied by the [[Swarthy Men]] who had joined Morgoth in the Nírnaeth. Annael and his people therefore took refuge in the caves of [[Androth]], where Tuor spent his youth. At the age of sixteen, Tuor wished to make war upon the Orcs and the [[Incomers]] who oppressed the land of his fathers, but was forbidden by Annael. Rather, in {{FA|488}}, the group resolved to flee Hithlum by the [[Annon-in-Gelydh]] and make their way to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Soon after setting out, however, they were assailed by [[Orcs]] and forced to scatter into the night. Tuor, however, refused to flee, and stood his ground, slaying many enemies before being captured.

===Journeys in the Wild===
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - And his heart was filled with longing.jpg|thumb|''And his heart was filled with longing'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
Tuor was thrall in the House of [[Lorgan]], chief of the [[Easterlings]] of Dor-lómin, for three years. He was treated harshly because Lorgan knew of his lineage, but nevertheless endured the torment until he found his opportunity to escape. Upon being sent into the woods on an errand, he slew his guards and, escaping pursuit, returned to the caves of Androth. For the next four years he dwelt alone there as an outlaw, slaying many Easterlings and accumulating a large price on his head. He was seeking the Annon-in-Gelydh &ndash; the 'Gate of the Noldor' through the [[Ered Lómin]], by which Annael had intended to escape Hithlum unnoticed. After years of searching, the Vala Ulmo, who had long ago chosen Tuor as his instrument, sent him a sign that finally led him to the Gate of the Noldor. Upon reaching its entrance, Tuor met [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], messengers of [[Círdan]] who were seeking a way to [[Gondolin]], and they showed him the path through the mountains to [[Nevrast]].

In {{FA|495}}, Tuor passed through Nevrast and became the first Man to reach the shores of [[Belegaer]], the Great Sea, and felt for the first time the sea-longing that would stay with him the rest of his life. He lingered by Belegaer until the autumn, and then after receiving another sign from Ulmo, followed seven [[swans]] southward. These led him to the abandoned city of [[Vinyamar]] where long ago Turgon had dwelt and, at the behest of Ulmo, left a sword, armour and a shield bearing the device of a white swan on a blue field. Tuor took these arms and made his way to the shore. Then during a great storm the Lord of Waters finally appeared to Tuor directly, ordering him to seek the city of Gondolin, and giving him a cloak that had a power to hide him from foes. The next morning he met [[Voronwë]], an elf of Gondolin who had been shipwrecked off the coast of Beleriand, rescued, and brought to Vinyamar by Ulmo. After hearing Tuor speak the words of Ulmo,  Voronwë agreed to guide him to the hidden gate of Gondolin.

===Life in Gondolin===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Tuor's sighting at Lake Ivrin.jpg|thumb|left|''Tuor's sighting at Lake Ivrin'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Voronwë led Tuor through the [[Woods of Núath]], a land desolated by the recent passing of [[Glaurung]] the Dragon to [[Nargothrond]]. At the [[Pools of Ivrin]] Tuor caught a brief glimpse of his ill-fated cousin [[Túrin]], son of Hurin, as he cried for [[Finduilas]] &ndash; the only time their two paths ever crossed. Then after enduring a [[Fell Winter (First Age)|bitter winter]] Tuor and Voronwë finally reached the gate of Gondolin. They were taken as prisoners by [[Elemmakil]] and brought before [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]] who, recognising from his arms that Tuor had been sent by Ulmo, welcomed them into the city with honour. Tuor then came before the High King Turgon and delivered the message of Ulmo: the [[Doom of Mandos]] was nearing its fulfilment and Turgon should abandon his city and retreat to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Idril, Earendil, Tuor.jpg|thumb|''Idril, Earendil, Tuor'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]
Turgon however chose not to heed Ulmo's warning, though it did prompt him to block up the hidden door and make Gondolin's isolation complete. Therefore Tuor remained in Gondolin, and like his father before him, he learned much from the Elves. He fell in love with [[Idril|Idril Celebrindal]], the daughter of the King, and she with him, and in {{FA|502}} they were married.<ref>{{WJ|P3}}, note 18.</ref> This [[Unions of Elves and Men|union]], as well as the favour of the King and the memory of his father, endeared Tuor to the people of Gondolin and he was made the leader of the [[House of the Wing]]. Only [[Maeglin]] harboured a secret hatred and jealousy of him.

Soon after their union a [[Half-elven]] was born to Tuor and Idril, who was named [[Eärendil]] or 'Sea-friend', reflecting the 'sea-longing' Tuor passed to his son.<ref name=""Letter297"">{{L|297}}</ref>

===Fall of Gondolin===
But in {{FA|510}}, Gondolin's secrecy finally failed. First [[Húrin]], Tuor's uncle, released from Morgoth's long torment and attempting to enter the city, revealed its location in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Still Morgoth would not have found an entrance to the city were it not for the treachery of Maeglin, who having defied the King's order and ventured outside the encircling mountains was captured by Orcs and brought to Angband &ndash; there he betrayed Turgon in return for the promise of the lordship of Gondolin and the possession of Idril.
[[File:Natalie Chen - Tuor.jpg|thumb|''Tuor'' by [[:Category:Images by Natalie Chen|Natalie Chen]]]]
During the subsequent [[Fall of Gondolin|siege]] Tuor fought valiantly. He rescued Idril from Maeglin, throwing the Elf from the walls of the city to his death. But in the end Gondolin fell and Turgon was killed. Tuor and Idril led the survivors of the sack in a desperate escape through the [[Idril's secret way|secret way]] Idril had prepared and over the mountains. Protected by Ulmo they journeyed down the vale of [[Sirion]] to the Havens at its mouth &ndash; the last refuge of the Elves of Beleriand. On the way the remnant of Gondolin stopped in [[Nan-tathren]] to make a feast in memory of the fallen, and here Tuor composed ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]'' for his son Eärendil.

===Fate===
Tuor and Idril dwelt for a while at the Mouths of Sirion. But eventually the sea-longing that had been instilled in him when he first came to the shores of Belegaer grew too strong. In {{FA|525}} he built a ship, [[Eärrámë]] ([[Quenya|Q]]: 'Sea-wing'), and sailed to the [[Aman|West]] with Idril, and possibly [[Voronwë]] also.<ref name=""WJ-TYears"">{{WJ|Years}}</ref> It was a tradition under the [[Eldar]] and [[Edain]] that they arrived in [[Valinor]], and that Tuor alone of Men was counted among the Eldar, immortal as other Elves.<ref group=""note"">Apparently by the special will of [[Ilúvatar]] himself; see [[Letter 153]].</ref>

However Huor's prophecy on the field of Nírnaeth Arnoediad proved true. In the same year that Tuor and Idril departed, Eärendil married [[Elwing]]. At first seeking after his father, he sailed to Valinor and roused the Valar to the [[War of Wrath]], and so became the prophesied saviour of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth. Through Eärendil, Tuor was an ancestor of the [[Half-elven]] and the [[Kings of Númenor]].

==Characteristics==
Tuor was ""fair of face"" and inherited the golden hair of the [[House of Hador]]. As a man he was ""strong and tall and valiant"" and skilled at arms. But, being raised by Elves, he also had great lore and skill.<ref name=""UT1p23-24"">{{UT|1}}, pp. 23-24</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Tuor'' was adapted to [[Sindarin]] from the language of the [[Edain]],<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 348, 364 (note 49)</ref><ref group=""note"">In a draft for a letter, Tolkien used the form ''Túor'' (cf. [[Letter 153]]).</ref> but its original meaning is not glossed.

In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', [[Noldorin]] ''Tuor'' (""strength-vigour"") derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''tūghor, tū-gor'' ([[Sundocarme|root]] TUG-). In the context of this etymology, ''Tuor'' can likely be analysed as ''[[tû]]'' (""strength"") + a derivative of root GOR (""violence, impetus, haste"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""GOR-"", ""TUG-""</ref>

==Other names==
Tuor bore the epithets '''''Eladar''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ""Starfather""), '''''Ulmondil''''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] ""Friend of Ulmo"")<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(ii) The House of Hador'', p. 235</ref> and '''[[the Blessed]]'''.<ref name=""TheBlessed"">{{GA|144}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
His paternal grandfather [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] was the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]],<ref name=""SComingOfMen"">{{S|17}}.</ref> so Tuor technically inherited that title after the death of his cousin [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] in {{FA|499}}, though by that time Dor-lómin had long since ceased to exist as a realm of the Edain. In [[Gondolin]] he was made the Lord of the [[House of the Wing]].

===The Book of Lost Tales===
[[File:Alan Lee - Tuor strikes a note on his harp.jpg|thumb|''Tuor strikes a note on his harp'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Tuor is the protagonist of the first tale of the [[legendarium]] written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]: ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]"", which became part of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. 

The tale begins without mentioning Tuor's early life and lineage, though later he introduces himself to the [[Gondothlim]] as ""''Tuor son of [[Peleg]] son of [[Indor]] of the [[house of the Swan]] of the sons of the Men of the North''"".<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160}} He was from the folk of [[Dor Lómin]], but he did not dwell with them, but lived in the woods of [[Mithrim]], singing with is harp. Now, his singing called the attention of other men, so he departed to lonely places. Thus destiny brought him to a cavern, and guided there by some [[Noldoli]], he crossed the [[Golden Cleft]] to the sea. There he built a house, which was called [[Falasquil]]. One day he saw three swans flying by the shore, and decided to follow them, for he had chosen the Swan as a emblem. Thus he reached a [[Sirion|river]], full of birds, and amid them he lost the sight of the swans. Then a group of [[Noldoli]] took him through the fenland region of [[Arlisgion]] and hence to the [[Nan-tathren|Land of Willows]]. Here Tuor tarried long time, for he was amazed with the trees and insects that lived there, but Ulmo appeared to him directly and ordered him to seek Gondolin.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|149–55}}

Tuor began his journey northwards seeking for the city with the help of wandering [[Gnomes]], but all of them abandoned him fearing Melko's creatures, but the Gnome [[Voronwë]] remained faithful and encouraged Tuor. Thus they reached an enchanted gate, which was hidden to any eye save for those Noldoli who escaped from Melko. After crossing a long and dark tunnel, they came to the light of a great plain, and in the middle they saw the city upon [[Amon Gwareth]]. The guards welcomed them and explained Tuor the [[Gondolin#The Seven Names|seven names of the city]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|156–8}}

After a day of march, Tuor and Voronwë entered Gondolin, greeted with awe by its people, and were taken before King [[Turgon]]. There Tuor, given the power and majesty of Ulmo's own voice, told Turgon to gather his forces and attack Melko as the time for his overthrow was ripe. Turgon refused this counsel and so Tuor warned him that both [[Elves]] and [[Men]] would suffer for a long time before the [[Valar]] could contrive another means of salvation. However Tuor voiced Ulmo's other [[Ulmo's warning|counsel]]: to leave Gondolin, travel down the Sirion, build ships and sail back to [[Valinor]] to ask  the Gods for help against Melko. Again Turgon refused, which caused Tuor a great sadness. Sitting beside the fountain of the king, he longed for the sea, but Turgon invited him to dwell in Gondolin, even in the king's halls, and he accepted, as he was weary. There he learned many things that would otherwise be kept secret from the race of Men. Matters of music, lore, architecture and culture were all taught to him and he became beloved in the city. Turgon had a suit of armour made for him and an axe, [[Dramborleg]]. Some years later he married Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] at [[Gar Ainion]], and [[Meglin]], the king's nephew, became jealous of them. In those days the desire of the Valar was fulfilled because Idril bore Tuor a son: [[Eärendel]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|160–5}}

At some point, a worried Idril asked Tuor to build a [[Idril's secret way|secret tunnel]] from their house to out of the city. He did not understand its purpose clearly, but answered ""''better is any plan than a lack of counsel''"".<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|168}} Some years later, Idril's concerns increased, and she [[Foresight|foretold]] him that the day was coming in which he would have to make a choice. She also asked him to gather a guard of faithful men and gave them his emblem, while she convinced his father to allow Tuor to make his own house and become a lord of the city.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|170–1}} Thus was made the bodyguard of Tuor, the [[house of the Wing]] which was counted as the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|twelfth house of Gondolin]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|174}} 
[[File:Tom Loback - Tuor slays Othrod.jpg|thumb|''Tuor slays Othrod'' by [[Tom Loback]]]]
When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, Tuor proposed to abandon the city to save its women and children, but King Turgon followed Meglin's advice of facing siege.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|175}} Tuor led his men to his house to say farewell to Idril and Eärendel before joining battle. But once there he found Meglin and the [[folk of the Mole]] capturing his family, ""and lo! Tuor gives a shout so great that the Orcs hear it afar and waver at the sound of it"". Seeing Tuor, Meglin tried to stab Eärendel, but the father jumped across the enemy and seized Meglin, took him by the middle and ghim out the walls to the fire. Then Tuor left [[Voronwë]] and some of his men with [[Idril]], and took the rest to the battle in the gate.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|177–8}}

Near the gate Tuor and his folk joined the battle alongside the [[house of the Fountain]], but soon some [[dragons]] pulled down the western walls of the city and enemies poured in. The wings in Tuor's helm blackened with the dragon flames, but he stood commanding all the men around. There he slain three [[Orcs|orc-lords]]: [[Othrod]], [[Balcmeg]] and [[Lug]]; as well as five [[Balrogs]]. Eventually he was forced to retreat bearing the injured Ecthelion. After being rescued by [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] in the [[Square of the Folkwell]], he rallied what remained of the defenders of the city and made for the [[Square of the Palace|King's Square]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|180–2}}

Tuor, with help of [[Glorfindel]], cleansed the Square of enemies, and later kept its defence with the help of [[Egalmoth]] in what is known as the bravest stand in all stories. However, a dragon entered followed by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, lord of Balrogs]] and Tuor and Egalmoth would have perished, but Ecthelion came to their aid and slew the Balrog, going to his own death in the attempt. At this point Turgon conceded the city was lost and refused to fight or leave, ordering Tuor to lead the survivors out of the city. Tuor was divided between his loyalty to the King and the love to his family, but chose to lead the survivors.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|183–6}} After they crossed the secret tunnel, they emerged onto the plain of [[Tumladin]] and ran to the Mountains for the whole night. With the rising of the sun, Tuor rescued Eärendel, who had fled the city earlier with a servant called [[Hendor]], from a pack of [[wolf-riders]]. Once reunited with their son, Tuor and Idril explained him the end of Gondolin.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|189–91}}

[[Tolkien]] never finished ''The Book of Lost Tales'', so there are contradictory outlines about the end of Tuor: first he sails alone in secret in his ship Alqarámë.<ref name=""Earendel"">{{LT2|V}}, pp. 253-4</ref> But later it is given a more detailed outline of his depart:

{{blockquote|One evening he calls Eärendel and they go to the shore. There is a skiff. Tûr bids farewell to Eärendel and bids him thrust it off — the skiff fares away into the West. Eärendel hears a great song swelling from the sea as Tûr's skiff dips over the world's rim.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', ""[[The Tale of Eärendel]]"", p. 260}}

In the different manuscripts of ''The Fall of Gondolin'' Tolkien alternated between ""Tuor"" and ""'''Tûr'''"", but eventually settled on ""Tuor"" in the [[The Earliest 'Silmarillion'|1930s ''Silmarillion'']].

'''Tareg''' ''the Ilkorin'' was an [[Ilkorindi|Elf]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name=Gilfanon>{{LT1|X}}, ''The Awakening of Men according to the later outline'', p. 237</ref>

== History ==
After the disastrous [[War of Palisor]], Tareg led his hosts north-westwards upon hearing the rumour of the newly arrived [[Gnomes]]. His hosts were then joined by many of the [[Ilkorindi|lost kindreds]].<ref name=Gilfanon/> 

Tareg and his host eventually arrived in the northwest of the [[Great Lands]], where they met the exiled Gnomes at the [[Mereth Aderthad|Feast of Reunion]], as well as the [[Men]] led by [[Ermon]], who were about to prepare for a war with [[Melko]]. There, Tareg joined forces with the host of [[Finwë|Nólemë]] (the leader of the Gnomes), along with the sons of Ermon, and, at a place called [[Gorfalong]], fought a [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|great battle]] with Melko and his forces, many of whom were Men corrupted by Melko.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes according to the later outline'', pp. 240-1</ref>

However, nothing else is known about Tareg's fate after the battle.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Tareg'' seems to be in [[Gnomish]] according to [[Paul Strack]], but no etymology is given.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1733870009.html|articlename=G. ''Tareg'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=14 October 2023}}</ref>

Bilbo had left for him an umbrella as a parting gift, although Adelard left taking some others.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Adelard is a combination of the Germanic elements ''adel'' (""noble"") and ''hard'' (""strong"").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 191</ref>

'''Estë''' was one of the [[Valier]] and the wife of [[Irmo]]. 

==Attributes==
Estë had the power to heal all hurts and weariness.<ref name=vala/> Her favourite place was an island on the tree-shadowed lake of [[Lórellin]] in the [[Gardens of Lórien]] where she slept during the day. She was always clad in grey.<ref name=vala/>

==History==
Estë dwelt with her husband Irmo in the misty halls and extensive, silver-lit gardens of [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. There were many [[Maiar]] who served Estë and Irmo. In Lórien, Estë and her husband tended to the [[Elves of Valinor]], who drew refreshment from the fountains, and even the [[Valar]] would come there to find repose and ease from the burdens of [[Arda]].<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> 

[[Varda]] originally intended to place the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] in the sky, one travelling from the east and one from the west, to allow for a mingling of their lights. However, Estë and her husband spoke against this as the excessive heat and light had withered their gardens, the stars were hidden, and restful sleep had been banished from the Earth. Varda listened to their counsel and, to allow for a time of night, changed the course of the Moon and the Sun. Each would then take turns travelling through the sky as the other lay in [[Ekkaia]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier drafts of this character, Estë did not attend the Councils of the Valar and was not reckoned among the Valier. Instead, she was counted as a Chief of the Maiar.<ref>{{MR|P2}}, p. 49, §3</ref>

==Etymology==
''Estë'' ([[Quenya]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈeste]}}) means ""rest"".<ref>{{HM|S}}, ""Index""</ref> The same [[Sundocarmë|root]], [[EZDE]], also yielded her [[Sindarin]] name, '''''Îdh''''' (pron. {{IPA|[iːð]}})<ref>{{HM|LR}}, ""[[The Etymologies]]"", entry EZDE</ref> and the [[Nandorin]] '''''Eord'''''.<ref>[[J.R.R.

'''Khamûl''' was one of the nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], second only to the [[Witch-king]] himself, and since {{TA|2951}}<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, ""A Knife in the Dark"", p. 167-9</ref> Sauron's lieutenant at [[Dol Guldur]]. He was also called ""'''the Shadow of the East'''"".<ref name=Black>{{UT|Black}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider.jpg|thumb|left|''Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider'' by [[Stephen Hickman]]]]
It is possible that Khamûl was an [[Easterlings|Easterling]].<ref group=note>The earlier byname ""the Black Easterling"" of a then unnamed Ringwraith at Dol Guldur and his later byname ""the Shadow of the East"" suggest that he was originally from the East, but the latter may also refer to the fact that he was based in Dol Guldur, which is in the East</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, ""Khamul, commander of Dol Guldur, was from the East"", p. 84</ref> Like the other Ringwraiths, he was one of nine [[Men]] to whom [[Sauron]] gave one of the [[Nine Rings|Rings of Power]], who became mighty kings, sorcerers or warriors, and eventually faded into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] that was under the rule of Sauron.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> By {{SA|2251}} he and the other eight Men who had received rings of power first appeared as Ringwraiths.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 2251, p. 1083</ref>

After the Witch-king, Khamûl had the best ability to perceive the presence of [[the One Ring]], but his power was most confused and diminished by daylight.<ref name=Note1>{{UT|Hunt}}, Notes, note 1</ref>

In {{TA|2951}}, Sauron declared himself openly to his enemies and sent Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]],<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2951, p. 1089</ref> with the former taking command.<ref name=Black/>

Around [[22 July]] {{TA|3018}}, Khamûl with another Ringwraith who lived at Dol Guldur met the Witch-king and six other Ringwraiths that lived at [[Minas Morgul]] in the [[Field of Celebrant]]. The Ringwraiths from Dol Guldur informed their fellow Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul that Gollum had escaped and vanished. Khamûl also told them that the villages of the [[Stoors]] at the river [[Gladden]] had been deserted for a long time and that it had not been possible to find a dwelling of [[Hobbits|Halflings]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=Black/>

In the evening of [[23 September]],<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}, pp. 1091-2</ref> Khamûl arrived in [[Hobbiton]] and asked [[Hamfast Gamgee]] about ""Baggins"". Hamfast Gamgee misled him that Frodo Baggins had already left and he rode to the east. On [[24 September]], he rode on the [[Stock Road]] and overtook Frodo and stopped,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 74</ref> because he sensed the Ring, but he was not certain because of the bright daylight and left again and waited until the night.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 97</ref> After the sunset he sensed the ring again and pursued Frodo.<ref name=Hunt99>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 99</ref> He did not dare to attack and retreated,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 78</ref> because he was intimidated by the [[Elves]] and by the song about [[Elbereth]].<ref name=Hunt99/> He could not sense the ring clearly as long as Frodo was surrounded by the Elves.<ref name=Hunt99/>

After the departure of the Elves Khamûl continued to pursue Frodo, but does not find him and called the [[F|other Ringwraith]] from Dol Guldur to him with cries. He and another Ringwraith from Dol Guldur went east over the fields and Khamûl visits [[farmer Maggot]].<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, pp. 93-4</ref> After leaving farmer Maggot he sent his companion off to take the [[Causeway]] in the direction of the [[Overbourn Marshes]] and he went north in the direction of the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. Khamûl then arrived too late at the [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the night of [[25 September]].<ref name=RC164>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', pp. 164-5</ref>

After Frodo had left on the ferry Khamûl summoned the other four Ringwraiths who had entered the Shire with him. He ordered one to watch the Brandywine Bridge and sent two to ride east on the [[East Road]] and inform the Witch-king that the ring has moved east.

Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths<ref name=Hunt194>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 194</ref> were on the bridge over the [[Hoarwell]] on [[11 October]],<ref name=Great/> but when [[Glorfindel]] approached them, they withdrew and were pursued by Glorfindel<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 210</ref> down the road until they left the road and scattered.<ref name=Hunt194/> However on [[14 October]], Khamûl, the Witch-king and three other Ringwraiths assembled again and continued with their pursuit.<ref name=Hunt194/>

On [[20 October]],<ref name=Great/> he was among the Ringwraiths who caught up with Frodo and his companions and dared to use the ford to ride into the river [[Loudwater]] to pursue Frodo who had already crossed the river,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 196</ref> but they were swept down the river by the flood<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, pp. 212-5</ref> that was called by [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 224</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
The bynames ""'''the Second Chief (the Black Easterling)'''"" were used for an unnamed Ringwraith that was based in Dol Guldur in a rejected version of the passage about the earlier movements of the Ringwraiths in ""The Hunt for the Ring"", but not in the final version where the Ringwraith who was Sauron's lieutenant at Dol Guldur was named Khâmul the Shadow of the East.<ref name=Note1/>

'''1987: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II]]''''' 
:[[Iron Crown Enterprises]] constructed an elaborate non-[[canon]]ical backstory for Khamûl. In their interpretation, he was born as Komûl in {{SA|1744}} and was heir to the [[Womaw]] kingdom in the East. His mother died when he was young, and he was raised by his manipulative stepmother, an Elf named Dardarian. She instilled in him a constant longing for immortality.

:By {{SA|1994}}, Komûl's people faced increasing pressure from their distant Númenórean cousins, who were establishing trade and military outposts in the East. To counter this threat, Komûl turned to his stepmother, Dardarian, who was in secret a servant of Sauron. By {{SA|1996}}, Komûl had accepted her gift, a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]], and came under the Dark Lord's sway. Komûl was ultimately forced to abdicate a year later in favour of a Numenorean-supported faction led by his popular cousin.

:He resurfaced at Barad-dûr in {{SA|2000}}. From then on he was known as Khamûl.<ref group=note>Noted to be the Black Speech pronunciation of his given name.</ref> When Sauron was imprisoned by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], he fled to his mother's people, the Shay. After the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] he returned to Mordor, but passed into the shadows as Sauron was defeated during the [[War of the Last Alliance]].

:Khamûl reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, briefly residing with Sauron at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. From there, he sought to gain influence over the peoples of southeastern Middle-earth, often working with [[Third of the Nazgûl|Dwar]] and contending with the [[Blue Wizards]]. During the [[Watchful Peace]], he lived at Minas Morgul but frequently traveled to Dol Guldur. During one of these visits, he captured [[Thráin]], taking his [[Seven Rings|Ring]] but failed to extract useful information from him.

:Khamûl wore a distinctive blue dragonhelm, and wielded several weapons in addition to his [[Morgul-knife]]:<ref name=ICE>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 92-94</ref>
* ''Water-skimmer'', a Cuivac-wooden killing-[[Wikipedia:Bolas|bola]].<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>
* ''Stinging Tongue'', a [[Mallorn]]-inlaid blowgun.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>

'''2001-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:Khamûl received two named miniatures in the game, one depicting his cloaked form and the other his armored appearance as seen in ''The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies''. The latter explicitly identifies Khamûl as the Ringwraith with a more ornate version of the Easterling helmets seen in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)]]'':'''
:During the nighttime section of the Shire level, Frodo overhears the conversation between Khamûl and [[Gaffer Gamgee]] just as he is about to deliver the [[Bag End]] key to Number 3, Bagshot Row. The conversation plays out as it does in the novel except that Khamûl's lines are audible. Instead of simply walking back down the path after the conversation ends, Khamûl (who is mounted on his horse) intimidates the Gaffer by rearing his steed while letting out a ghastly wail, before galloping back down the road. No voice actor is specified for the role.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl in charge of Dol Guldur is known simply as ""The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur"", formerly ""The Cursed Rider"". He is said to have been an Easterling chieftain who wielded the Ring ""Orôm, the Warmonger"".

==History==
In {{TA|1601}}, the two brothers led a group of mostly [[Harfoots|Harfoot]] [[hobbits]] westwards from [[Bree]].<ref name=""family"" /> They crossed the river [[Baranduin]] at the [[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Stonebows]], and with the permission of [[King of Arthedain|King]] [[Argeleb II]] they settled in the royal hunting grounds of [[Arthedain]] and founded [[the Shire]].

The '''Mouth of Sauron''' was the Lieutenant of the Tower of [[Barad-dûr]], a servant and emissary of [[Sauron]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. He was a tall [[Men|man]] that was robed in black and wore a high helm.<ref name=""Gate"">{{RK|Gate}}, p. 888</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
The Mouth of Sauron was a [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] who ""entered the service of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] when it first rose again"".<ref group=""note"">It has been noted that this reference is difficult to interpret; according to [[Appendix B]] the Dark Tower arose first some time after {{SA|3320}} and again in {{TA|2951}}. If the Mouth lived in the Second Age, he would be one of the [[King's Men]] of [[Númenor]], and probably prolonged his life with sorcery (cf. {{HM|Guide}}, p. 274); in the second interpretation he would serve Sauron only for 68 years, and this would make him a Black Númenórean of [[Umbar]] or [[Harad]]. The second interpretation is more feasible (and supported by [[Michael Martinez]]) but both have been considered.</ref> He had forgotten his original name, which is not remembered in any tale.<ref name=""Gate"" />

The Mouth of Sauron learned great sorcery and knew many of the Dark Lord's plans as a servant of Sauron. Being more cruel than an [[Orcs|Orc]] and cunning, he rose in power and favour.<ref name=""Gate"" />

===Late Third Age===
It is not known if the messenger who came from Mordor to King [[Dáin Ironfoot]] on a horse during the night in {{TA|3017}} and asked about the whereabouts of a [[Hobbit]] and for the return of a little ring that was stolen by this Hobbit was the Mouth of Sauron.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 240</ref>

The Mouth of Sauron briefly appeared on a huge and hideous black [[horse]] or horse-like creature when he haggled with the army of the west in front of the [[Black Gate|Morannon]], trying to convince [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] to give up and let Sauron win the battle for [[Middle-earth]]. Though he came before Aragorn and his men as an ambassador, he used quite insolent speech when he dealt with them. He tried to intimidate the army into surrendering by showing them the [[Mithril-coat]] of [[Frodo Baggins]] to make them think that the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] had been captured. Among the demands of Sauron he presented was the restoration of [[Isengard]], from which he believed he would rule over the lands west of the [[Anduin]] under Sauron. When Gandalf turned down his proposal, the Mouth of Sauron set all the armies of [[Barad-dûr]] upon them.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, pp. 888-892</ref>

The Mouth's fate is nowhere recorded, but it is probable he died in the assault before the Morannon.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 274</ref> If he had survived, it is likely that he would have been one of the leaders in the retreat of Sauron's evil servants after the fall of Barad-dûr.

==Other names==
The name ""the Mouth of Sauron"" poses a possible inconsistency in the narrative. Aragorn mentions that Sauron did not allow the name Sauron (which means ""Abhorred"" in [[Quenya]]) to be written or spoken.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}, p. 416</ref> Therefore it would be strange for a servant of Sauron to have a title that includes the name ""Sauron"". However, it is possible that the Mouth of Sauron did not use this title in the presence of Sauron and only used it when he was speaking to someone who was not a servant of Sauron.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a manuscript of an outline of Book V, the name of Sauron's messenger at Dagorlad is '''''Mordu'''''.<ref>{{WR|3|III}}, p. 256; [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that the last two letters of the name might be read as ''du'', p. 267, note 32</ref> Following Mark Fisher's suggestion,<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/m/mouthofsauron.html|articlename=Mouth of Sauron|dated=|website=EoA|accessed=14 December 2013}}</ref> [[Paul Strack]] explains that ''Mordu'' is a [[Noldorin]] name, probably meaning ""Black Night"", from ''[[morn]]'' (""black"") + ''[[dû]]'' (""night"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2485707341.html|articlename=N. ''Mordu'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 September 2022}}</ref>

In an earlier draft of the chapter ""The Black Gate Opens"", the Mouth was described as a living man, that was captured as a youth and in a later draft as the son of a house of wise and noble men in Gondor who desired evil knowledge and entered the service of the Dark Tower.<ref>{{WR|3|XIII}}, p. 431</ref>

'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron briefly appears at the Black Gate. In this adaptation he was voiced by [[Don Messick]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The Mouth of Sauron's role is expanded. He is portrayed as the person who tortures [[Gollum]] into telling Sauron of ""Baggins"" and ""Shire"", though he is not named until the credits.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Michael Bakewell]], [[Brian Sibley]] (eds.) [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]], ""[[The Long Awaited Party]]""</ref> [[John Rye]] provided the voice of the Mouth of Sauron, symbolising the function of the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:The Mouth of Sauron is played by Peter Gawajda.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''
:The Mouth of Sauron does not appear in the theatrical cut of the movie, but he does appear in the extended version, played by an unrecognizable [[Bruce Spence]]. His helmet, with the words ""LAMMEN GORTHAUR"" ([[Sindarin]] for ""Voice of (Sauron) The Abominable"") in [[Cirth]] written on it, covers his entire face except for his mouth, which is horribly diseased and disfigured by all the evil he has spoken, and disproportionately large, creating an unsettling effect. In fact, much of this spectacle is a result of CGI effects. Actually Jackson conceived this idea long after the footage had been shot and asked his special effects team to create the effect digitally.

:The extended DVD cast commentary mentions that Jackson considered different depictions of the character, such as having Kate Winslet (who starred in ''Heavenly Creatures'', another Jackson film) play the role, partially to emphasize the temptations Aragorn was facing.

:In the movie itself, Aragorn decapitates the Mouth of Sauron with [[Andúril|his sword]].  This sequence is often criticized by purist and outsider alike; through human history it was considered a crime of war to execute messengers or heralds. In the book, the Mouth actually specifically points out that as an ambassador he is protected by the laws of war, and Gandalf acknowledges this:

::''""...though Aragorn did not stir nor move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow.  ""I am a herald and an ambassador, and may not be assailed!"" he cried.  ""Where such laws hold,"" said Gandalf, ""it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence.  But no one has threatened you.  You have naught to fear from us...""'' -- Book V, Chapter 10, ""The Black Gate Opens""

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of the Mouth of Sauron is provided by Juraj Slezáček.

'''2013: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron was added as a playable Guardian in a 2013 piece of DLC. 

'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron is one of the Gúrzyul, mortal servants of [[Sauron]] whom through the Dark Arts he had made ageless during the [[Second Age]], although unlike [[wraiths]] they remain bound to their physical bodies and can be killed. First appearing at the [[Black Gate]] in a sequence near-identical to that in the book, the Mouth of Sauron survives the demise of his master and names himself Dulgabêth the Black Word, Sauron's Heir. The Mouth of Sauron is later killed by the player with the help of two Rangers.

He may have had a younger brother, [[Elmo]].<ref name=""Galadriel"">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

== History ==
=== In Middle-earth ===
Olwë was born in [[Cuiviénen]] and was the younger brother of [[Elwë]], one of the ambassadors taken by [[Oromë]] to [[Valinor]] to see the [[Two Trees]]. When the ambassadors returned, they urged their peoples to hear the summons of Oromë and go to the [[West]]. Because their clan was the largest, it was divided in two hosts under the two brothers and together, they led their people.<ref name=capt/>

The [[Nelyar]] were the most unwilling during the [[Great Journey]] and Olwë's host was always the hindmost.<ref name=capt>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> [[Nandor|Some]] of Olwë's host were terrified by the shadow of the [[Misty Mountains]] and preferred to settle by the woodlands of the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=capt/>

During a long wait in [[Beleriand]], [[Elwë]] disappeared.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref> After years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Teleri to [[Valinor]], on the insistence of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]].<ref name=Princes/>

=== In Aman ===
Olwë and his people dwelt on the island of [[Tol Eressëa]] for a while, where the [[Teleri]] could be by the sea whilst also bathing in the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]].<ref>{{AA|72}}</ref> These people became the [[Falmari]].<ref name=capt/> When they finally came to [[Eldamar]] some centuries later, the [[Falmari]], under the lordship of Olwë, began the building of [[Alqualondë]] with the aid of the [[Noldor]].<ref>{{AA}}</ref>

His daughter [[Eärwen]] married [[Finarfin]] son of [[Finwë]] and later king of the remaining [[Noldor]]. Besides Eärwen, Olwë had several sons.<ref name=""Princes"">{{S|Princes}}</ref>

==== The Kinslaying at Alqualondë ====
When [[Fëanor]] revolted against the [[Valar]], he attempted to persuade the [[Teleri]] to join him in order to obtain their ships. They were unmoved, wanting no other realm than [[Eldamar]] and no other lord than Olwë. [[Fëanor]] reproached Olwë and his people as ""fainthearted loiterers"" and reminded them that the [[Noldor]] had aided them when they first arrived. Olwë rebuked Fëanor's folly and refused to give him any ships of the [[Teleri]], which they valued as the Noldor did their gems. [[Fëanor]] withdrew but then led his forces to [[Alqualondë]] to take the ships by force, leading to the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|first Kinslaying]]. As the Noldor rowed the stolen vessels northward, Olwë called for [[Ossë]] to stop them, but it was not permitted by the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

In one manuscript, the [[Telerin]] form of ''Olwë'' is said to be '''''Olue'''''.<ref>{{WJ|A}}, p. 369</ref> In another manuscript the Telerin form is similar to the Quenya form: ''Olwë''.<ref name=Shibboleth>{{PM|XINotes}}, Note 20, p. 357</ref>

The Falmari sometimes called him '''''Volwë'''''.<ref name=Shibboleth/> Another one of his names was '''''Ciriáran''''' (meaning ""mariner king"").<ref>{{PM|XI4}} p. 341</ref>

'''Telimektar''' was a [[Valar|Vala]], the son of [[Tulkas]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name=""War""/>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Telimektar is first mentioned in the ''Lost Tales'' in the story of ''[[the Chaining of Melko]]''. There, he was ""but just war-high"" when he fought at his father's side against [[Melko]] in the war which ended with the captivity of the Enemy. In that story Telimektar had ""a long sword girt about his waist by a silver girdle.""<ref name=""War"">{{LT1|IV}}, p. 101</ref>

His next mention is during the [[Darkening of Valinor]], where he was pursuing Melko along with the other [[Valar]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 154</ref>

=== Later history ===
According to one text, when Melko broke free of his second imprisonment (after the [[March of Liberation]]), he went to [[Tol Eressëa]] in order to sow dissension between the [[Gnomes]] and the [[Solosimpi]], who sent for help to [[Valinor]]. However, the only aid that came from the Valar was that of Tulkas, who in secret sent his son Telimektar to Tol Eressëa to aid them.

There, Telimektar, with the help of [[Ingil]]<ref group=""note"">In ''[[The Cottage of Lost Play]]'', it is said that Ingil eventually returned to Valinor, which seems to represent a different, distinct idea from the one mentioned above.</ref> son of [[Inwë]], surprised Melko and wounded him, and chased him up the [[Pine of Tavrobel]] all the way to [[Ilwë]]. However, Melko kept attacking the [[Sun]] and the [[stars]], and in the end caused the death of [[Urwendi]] the steerer of the Sun-vessel.

Finally, the Valar decided to cut down the great Pine, which left Melko stranded out of the world.

However, Telimektar and Ingil had to remain in the sky, guarding ceaselessly until Melko's return in the [[Great End]]. There, [[Varda]] periodically gives him [[stars]] to replace the ones Melko destroys and to remind the world of the Valar's watch - and the constellation of [[wikipedia:Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is afterwards seen as his image in the sky.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''4''', pp. 281-2</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Telimektar''<ref group=""note"">In the later outlines of the ''Lost Tales'', his name is given as '''''Telumektar''''' instead.</ref> is in [[Qenya]].<ref name=""Eld"">{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1989343939.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

== Other names ==
The [[Gnomish]] cognate of ''Telimektar'' is '''''Telumaithor''''',<ref group=""note"">In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', this name is given as '''''Telumaithar'''''.</ref> with the earlier forms of the name being ''Telumaithron'' and ''Telumaithweg''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 70</ref>

One of his names was '''''Mordo'''''. It is a Gnomish word adopted into Qenya, being derived from ''[[mavar]]'' (""shepherd"") through Gnomish ''[[mord]]'' - its meaning being a poetic one for ""man, warrior"" or otherwise possibly derived from the ""warlike qualities of the shepherds"". A similar name was '''''Taimordo''''' ('''''Taimondo''''' being a corrupt form of the name), with '''''Daimort''''' (changed from ''Daimord''<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 29</ref>) being its Gnomish cognate.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 62</ref><ref group=""note"">The true Qenya cognate of ''Daimord'' was '''''Taimavar''''', with the other forms given above being corruptions of the name.</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-76152031.html|articlename=G. ''Daimord'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=5 April 2022}}</ref>

Another late name for the character was '''''Telmaithron'''''.<ref>{{PE|14}}, ""[[The Names of the Valar]]"", p. 13</ref>

In one of the later outlines, which might have formed the basis for ''The Book of Lost Tales'', Telimektar was said to have a son called [[Lúthien (son of Telimektar)|Lúthien]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''16''', pp. 301-2</ref>

The idea of Telimektar and Ingil (known to [[Men]] in later ages as Orion and Sirius respectively) guarding against Melko's eventual return was ultimately abandoned. In its place, the idea of [[Eärendel]] keeping the watch on the [[Door of Night]] through which Melko/Morgoth was thrust at the end of the [[War of Wrath]], was adopted instead.<ref>{{SM|2a}}, p. 75</ref>

In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[The Siege of Gondor]]""}}

The '''Witch-king of Angmar''' was the chief of the [[Nazgûl]], King of [[Angmar]] and [[Sauron]]'s great captain in his wars. A [[Wraiths|wraith]], the Witch-king of Angmar was nearly indestructible, a terrifying warrior, and a cunning strategist.

==History==
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - The King of Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|left|''The King of Nazgûl'' by [[:Category:Images by Catherine Karina Chmiel|Catherine Chmiel]]]]
Some time after Sauron seized the [[Rings of Power]] in the [[Sack of Eregion]], {{SA|1697}} he gave [[Nine Rings|nine of them]] to [[Men|Mannish]] kings, sorcerers and other warriors.<ref>{{S|Rings}}, p. 289</ref>  With the power of their rings, the Nine achieved glory and grew wealthy, but they eventually started hating life as they were slowly drawn under Sauron’s dominion. In the end, they all became the dreadful [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].

The one later known as the Witch-king<ref group=""note"">According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the oldest meaning of ''witch'' is ""a man who practices witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer, wizard""</ref> was a sorcerer,<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 257</ref><ref name=""RK|Siege"">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 819</ref> probably<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 20 citing from J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript of ''Nomenclature'' ""he was probably (like the Lieutenant of Barad-dur [the Mouth of Sauron]) of Numenorean descent""</ref> one of the unnamed three lords of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] race, who accepted one of the Rings of Power.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> He first appeared in the histories as a Ringwraith in {{SA|2251}}. Being the most powerful of the Nazgûl, he became their chief and the most feared servant of his master Sauron.

When [[Mordor]] fell in {{SA|3441}}, the Nazgûl vanished into the shadows and were not heard of again for a long time.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3441, p. 1084</ref>

===Early power in Angmar===
More than a thousand years later, in c. {{TA|1050|n}} of the [[Third Age]], [[Sauron]] began to rebuild his power in [[Dol Guldur]]. In c. {{TA|1300|n}} his Nazgûl also reappeared and the Witch-king established his realm, [[Angmar]], in the north.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1300, p. 1086</ref> His capital was [[Carn Dûm]], on the northernmost peak of the [[Misty Mountains]]. He summoned men, [[orcs]] and other creatures of evil inclination to his banner. No one knew that he was actually a servant of the long-dormant [[Sauron]] and few that he was a wraith.<ref name=""Malvegil"">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Malvegil, p. 1040</ref>

In the north, disunity plagued the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Arnor]]. They had divided into three kingdoms: [[Cardolan]], [[Rhudaur]] and [[Arthedain]], and were constantly at war with one another.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> The Witch-king saw the North-kingdom of Arnor as more vulnerable than the South-kingdom of Gondor.<ref name=""Malvegil"" /> He played upon their opposition, sending in infiltrators and taking over the hearts of the men of that land. By {{TA|1349|n}}, the government of Rhudaur was controlled by men secretly in his service,<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Malvegil]], pp. 193-194</ref> and he secretly aided them in their wars against the other kingdoms.<ref name=""Argeleb"">{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Argeleb I]], p. 194</ref> He then struck at a time of great hostility among the three, in {{TA|1409|n}}. Rhudaur in the east fell first, and most of the Dúnedain there were hunted down and slaughtered by sorcerers.<ref name=""Arveleg"">{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Arveleg I]], p. 194</ref> Cardolan was ravaged and its [[last prince of Cardolan|last prince]] slain;<ref>{{HM|RC}}, ""Fog on the Barrow-downs"", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> the tower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], held by the men of Arthedain, was placed under siege. King [[Arveleg I]] was slain and the tower was destroyed, but the coveted ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' escaped in the hands of the surviving men of Arthedain and was brought to [[Fornost]].<ref name=""Palantiri16"">{{UT|14a}}, Note 16, p. 413</ref>

The Witch-king continued to press the men of Arthedain, laying siege to Fornost, and he might have taken over all of Arnor in that one offensive. But [[Araphor]], the 18-year-old son of Arveleg, came to leadership and, with the help of the ancient elf [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]], repelled the Witch-king’s forces at Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Araphor, p. 1040</ref> [[Elrond]] brought an army of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] and [[Lothlórien]], and the Witch-king was pushed back and subdued.

===Twilight of Angmar===
The Witch-king sat silent in Carn Dûm, rebuilding his armies and preparing for a final assault on [[Arthedain]], last of the Arnorian kingdoms. The [[Great Plague]] came and went in {{TA|1636|n}}, taking with it the last of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]]. The Witch-king sent [[barrow-wights]] to inhabit the barrows in [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Argeleb II, p. 1041</ref> In {{TA|1974|n}}, he felt that his power was sufficiently restored to begin the advance.

His attack was sudden, but not unexpected. King [[Arvedui]] sent a message to King [[Eärnil II]] of [[Gondor]] the year before, but help did not arrive in time. [[Fornost Erain]] fell, and the Witch-king took up residence there in the palace.<ref name=""Eärnil"">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1051</ref> Arvedui held out as best as he might on the [[North Downs]], but at last fled north with the treasured ''[[palantíri]]'' of [[Amon Sûl-stone|Amon Sûl]] and [[Annúminas-stone|Annúminas]]. He would not return, for he perished in a shipwreck in {{TA|1975|n}}. With him the ''palantíri'' were lost forever in the icy seas of [[Forod]]. The already-diminished North-kingdom ended, and [[Arnor]] fell.<ref name=""Arvedui"">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui and entry for Chieftain Aranarth, pp. 1041-3</ref>

Meanwhile, a coalition in the south had formed. Eärnil sent his son, [[Eärnur]], north with a great fleet, all that Gondor could spare. They arrived at [[Lindon]] and joined with the folk of Círdan. Círdan summoned all that would come: surviving Dúnedain of Arnor and elves of Lindon.<ref name=""Eärnil"" /> Even a company of [[Hobbits|hobbit]] archers went to their aide.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui, p. 1042</ref> The Witch-king had grown overconfident and, instead of staying behind his fortifications, initiated the attack. The [[Battle of Fornost]] was fought on the plain between [[Nenuial]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king may not have anticipated the strength brought against him, but for whatever reason the alliance gained the upper hand. His army began to fall back toward Fornost, but Eärnur’s magnificent horsemen struck from the north and the Witch-king was routed.<ref name=""Eärnil"" />

He decided to flee to Angmar and the safety of Carn Dûm, but the cavalry, with Eärnur himself in the lead, overtook him.  Moreover, the ranks of the allies swelled, as an army of elves from [[Rivendell]] came led by the mighty hero of old, [[Glorfindel]]. Angmar was purged of men and orcs, and all seemed lost for the Witch-king in the face of such numbers. But the Witch-king himself came at the last, robed and masked in black and riding a black horse, and attempted to kill Eärnur with his own hands. But Eärnur’s horse shied away and fled, and the Witch-king laughed. But Glorfindel came on his white horse, and faced with such power the Witch-king fled.  He vanished into the shadows and no-one marked where he had gone.<ref name=""Eärnil"" />

Eärnur wanted to pursue, but Glorfindel held him back and made his famous prophecy.

{{Blockquote|He will not return to this land.  Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.|Glorfindel, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', [[Appendix A]] (iv)}}

===Lord of Minas Morgul===
[[File:Alan Lee - The Witch-king.jpg|thumb|''The Witch-king'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
The Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and gathered the other Ringwraiths about him in {{TA|1980|n}}. Angmar and Carn Dûm were lost, and so in {{TA|2000|n}} the Ringwraiths began a [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|two-year siege]] of [[Minas Ithil]], eventually capturing the place and turning it into his residence. The wraiths sent an aura of fear in [[Gondor]], and much of [[Ithilien]] was deserted.<ref name=""gondor"" />

Eärnur succeeded his father as King of Gondor, and still held the Witch-king in especial hostility due to his humiliation at the Battle of Fornost. [[Third Age 2043|The year]] of his coronation the Witch-king sent him a taunting challenge, but [[Mardil]] the [[steward]] restrained Eärnur from rash action. [[Third Age 2050|Seven years later]] the challenge was repeated, and Eärnur rode with a small escort to Minas Morgul; none ever returned, and there was no longer a King in Gondor.<ref name=""gondor"">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

After this the Witch-king bided his time.  He and the Nazgûl built up their armies, including the terrible new orc-race of [[Uruks]]. In {{TA|2475|n}} he sent them out to capture [[Osgiliath]], which they did successfully.  They were driven out by [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], who led campaigns to recapture Ithilien, but Osgiliath now lay completely in ruins and the region was left devastated and depopulated. Boromir was a great captain, and even the Witch-king feared him, but he was felled by a Morgul-wound and his rule was but twelve years.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Boromir, p. 1053</ref>

===Hunt for the Ring===
Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951|n}}, and sent three of his Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]] (though the Witch-king was left in Minas Morgul). Then, by lucky chance, the creature [[Gollum]] was captured and interrogated. Under torture, the wretched creature revealed the tale of [[the One Ring]] and how it came to be in his possession.  But from his words, Sauron misunderstood that the land of the hobbits who stole the Ring was on the banks of the [[Gladden River]], whence Gollum originally came from.<ref name=""thirteen"">{{UT|Hunt}}, p. 338-341</ref> Sauron sent the Nine, under the leadership of the Witch-king, invisible and uncloaked, to search for the Ring after the assault of Osgiliath.

[[Khamûl]], the Witch-king’s lieutenant, reported that he was unable to find the “[[the Shire|Shire]]” in the vales of [[Anduin]].  The Witch-king was determined to search north and west until Gollum was found, or the Shire.  But plans were halted when Sauron received word of the events in Gondor and the doings of the turncoat [[Saruman]], and concluded that the Wise did not yet have possession of the Ring.  He sent the Ringwraiths to [[Isengard]] in the form of [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], and as they passed through Rohan their terror was so great that many fled the land, believing the Riders heralded an invasion. 

They arrived at Isengard too late to prevent the escape of the captured wizard [[Gandalf]]; Saruman realized he had been revealed as a traitor to both sides due to his transparent lust for the Ring, and having no chance of deceiving Sauron any further, fortified himself in Isengard. The Witch-king did not have enough power with him to assault Saruman in his great fortress. He demanded the Wizard come forth, but received only the voice of Saruman. Nonetheless cunning and wary, Saruman convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring were, and so the Nine went out in search of him.<ref name=""thirteen"" />

The Ringwraiths came upon the traitor called [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] and questioned him.  The terrified man told them everything he knew; that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them.  The Witch-king spared Wormtongue’s life, foreseeing that Wormtongue would bring ruin to Saruman.  He divided his wraiths into four pairs, and went with the swiftest to [[Minhiriath]].  Along the way they captured several spies of Saruman, and found to their delight charts and maps of the Shire. They sent along the spy to [[Bree]], warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Saruman.<ref name=""thirteen"" />

They came to [[Sarn Ford]], but the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] prevented them from crossing. The Rangers sent for their captain, [[Aragorn II]], as he was away, but defeating the Nazgûl was a task beyond the power of the Dúnedain, and may have been so even had Aragorn been present; the Ringwraiths attacked at night, capturing the ford and killing many of the Rangers. A few survivors fled northward to warn Aragorn of the wraiths' approach, but were pursued and slain or driven off into the wilds.<ref name=""thirteen"" /> The Witch-king sent three Ringwraiths under Khamûl into the Shire while he went east with the others.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 22, p. 1091</ref> But they had come too late: the Ring had moved on in the hands of a hobbit, [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name=""Knife"">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

===Pursuit of the Ring===
Khamûl was unsuccessful, but brought word from the spy they had spared in Bree. The man had witnessed a vanishing act on Frodo's part, and had organized an attack on the inn. The Witch-king assumed that Frodo would head east to [[Rivendell]], and sent four wraiths to [[Weathertop]],<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 164-6</ref> the ruins of the tower he had destroyed long ago. He went south along the [[Greenway]] and discovered nothing. Gandalf followed them, but the Witch-king let him slip ahead, and attacked him on Weathertop. Gandalf escaped at dawn, and again the Witch-king divided his force and sent four after the wizard while he and Khamûl remained near Weathertop to watch it.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 167-8</ref>

The chieftain of the Dúnedain, Aragorn II, had become the guide of the hobbits, and led them to Weathertop, where they were spotted and attacked by the Ringwraiths led by the Witch-king. The Witch-king advanced on Frodo, and the terrified hobbit put on the Ring, seeing the wraiths as they truly were. The Witch-king was taller than the others, with long hair and a crown set on his helm. When Frodo resisted the wraith's approach, and invoked the name of [[Varda|Elbereth]], the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder.<ref name=""Knife"" /> The tip of his [[Morgul-knife|blade]] broke off and remained in Frodo's shoulder.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, pp. 221-2</ref> Then Aragorn counterattacked with flaming brands.<ref name=""Knife"" /> The Witch-king departed with the other Nazgûl, believing that his objective was completed.

He resumed the pursuit quickly, though,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', pp. 180-1</ref> and found that Khamûl had been driven from the [[Last Bridge]] by his old enemy [[Glorfindel]]. The Witch-king, who only had one companion with him, was likewise unable to confront him openly.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 194</ref> They regrouped and went south, rejoining with the other four. They managed to pick up the trail of the company of the Ring, and despite hindrance from Glorfindel and Aragorn managed to pursue Frodo alone on [[Asfaloth]]. The pursuit came to the [[Ford of Bruinen]], and there Frodo compelled the horse to stop. The Witch-king saw his defiance and laughed, breaking his sword with a movement of his hand. But the waters of the [[Bruinen]] rose at [[Elrond]]'s command, sweeping the Nine downstream.<ref name=""fourteen"">{{FR|Flight}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 195-6</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:Angus McBride - Gandalf facing Witch-king.gif|thumb|''Gandalf facing the Witch-king'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
The Witch-king took the only surviving horse back to [[Mordor]], arriving there in December. In addition, help was sent to the other eight Nazgûl when they were on their way back.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from a manuscript of The Hunt for the Ring, p. 262</ref>  In [[Minas Morgul]] they prepared for a grand invasion of [[Gondor]] at the order of their master. The Witch-king was given by Sauron added ""demonic"" force.<ref name=""fifteen"">{{L|210}}, p. 272</ref> On 10 March {{TA|3019|n}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 10, p. 1093</ref> the signal was given and Minas Morgul was emptied. The Witch-king rode at the head of the army clothed in black with a crown on his hooded head. As the Witch-king passed out of the gates of the dead city in the direction of Ithilien, he stopped, probably sensing the presence of [[the One Ring]], but he continued riding down the road after a while.<ref name=""Stairs"" />

The army from Minas Morgul commanded by the Witch-king was reinforced by regiments of [[Haradrim]] outnumbered the forces of [[Faramir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Denethor|Denethor II]]'s son, who defended the fords over the river [[Anduin]] at [[Osgiliath]] ten times and soon managed to cross the river in a large numbers of floats and barges, which they had secretly built on the eastern side of Osgiliath on the eastern side of the river. As a consequence, Faramir retreated with his men to the [[Causeway Forts]] at the [[Rammas Echor]].<ref name=""Siege"">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 817</ref> The Rammas Echor was breached, and the [[Pelennor Fields]] were overrun. Other wraiths he sent out mounted on [[Fell beasts]]. Faramir was wounded by a dart and the [[Black Breath|black breath]], but his company was saved by a sortie. Then the Witch-king laid siege to [[Minas Tirith]] itself, sending fire and the heads of the dead Gondorians into the city via catapults. Then he launched the assault.

He sent [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] out first, accompanying it in person so as to be the first to enter the city.  Three times Grond struck the gate, empowered by the sorcery of the Witch-king. The third time the Gate shattered in a flash of fire. The Witch-king passed into Minas Tirith, but was confronted by Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]]. Gandalf forbade him entry, but the Witch-king laughed and put on a show of power.

{{Blockquote|The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br>'Old fool!' he said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it?  Die now and curse in vain!' And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[The Siege of Gondor]]""}}

===Fall===
[[File:Alarie - Eowyn and the Witchking 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Éowyn and the Witch-king'' by [[:Category:Images by Alarie|Alarie]]]]
As Gandalf stood resolute before the Witch-king, the [[Rohirrim]] arrived. Thus he departed, mounting a fell beast and descending upon King [[Théoden]] who led the attack.  [[Snowmane]], the King's horse, collapsed with a dart in the side, and Théoden was crushed beneath him.  But the rider [[Dernhelm]] defied the Witch-king.  The Witch-king threatened Dernhelm with a terrible death, but the rider revealed that she was a woman, [[Éowyn]], and the Witch-king remembered the words of Glorfindel. He hesitated, but then moved forward. Éowyn decapitated the fell beast, but the Witch-king rose and struck her down with his mace, breaking her shield-arm. Then the hobbit [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] stabbed him in the sinew of his leg with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|blade of Westernesse]] (though there was much pain in Meriadoc's arm afterwards), as he drew back to kill the woman.  Then Éowyn rose and drove her sword through where his invisible head was, and the sword broke as his crown toppled.  The Witch-king gave a great and horrible wail, perishing at last (in the [[Letters]] it is said he was “reduced to impotence”).<ref name=""Pelennor"">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

So the prophecy of Glorfindel was fulfilled, for the Witch-king did not fall at the hands of a man, but that of [[Éowyn|a woman]]; and not by a [[Men|Man]] but [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|a Halfling]]. With his defeat, and the coming of Aragorn II in the black ships, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was lost by Sauron.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The Witch-king was originally introduced in the story as the ""Wizard King"" during the development of [[The Council of Elrond]] chapter.<ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 116</ref> He continues to be referred to under that name in outlines<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 326</ref><ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, p. 359</ref> and a manuscript for the chapter [[The Siege of Gondor]] where  Gandalf says that he is not only the captain of the [[Black Riders]], but a former member of his own [[Istari|order]] before ""evil took him""<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 331</ref>.

In the early versions of the story, the ""Wizard King"" was planned to survive the Pelennor Fields battle and appear as the ambassador at the [[Black Gate]] instead of the [[Mouth of Sauron]].<ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, pp. 361-362 and note 12, p. 364</ref> In early manuscripts the ""Wizard King"" even survived after [[Frodo]] has thrown the Ring in [[Sammath Naur]], blocking the door and saying: “Here we all end together”. At this point, either Sam appears at his back and stabs him from behind (with Sting?), or Frodo draws Sting, commands him to follow the Ring and drives him into the Fire.<ref>{{SD|1|Mordor}}, pp. 5-7</ref>

In the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', Tolkien speculates that the Witch-King might be afraid of Frodo, as he invoked [[Elbereth]] (a “name of terror for the Nazgûl”) and he could have slain the Barrow-wight.<ref name=""RC"">{{HM|RC}}, ""Flight to the Ford"", p. 180</ref>

==Etymology==
While in modern English ''witch'' has mostly female connotations, referring to a hag or sorceress, in middle-English 
''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word) wicche]'' had no gender distinction; the preference of ''witch'' for female persons (the males referred more usually as ''wizzards'') evolved later through the centuries. Tolkien uses the archaic, gender-unspecific meaning of the term, which was ""a man who practises witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer or wizard"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 21 citing from the 'Oxford English Dictionary'</ref>

==Other names==
*Witch-king of Angmar<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref> - ""Witch"" most likely coming from his background in sorcery, and ""king"" after his establishment of the realm of Angmar in 1300.
*Witch-lord of Angmar<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 5</ref>
*Lord of the Nazgûl<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 819 and p. 829</ref><ref>{{RK|Battle}}, pp. 839-40</ref>
*Lord of the Ringwraiths<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, p. 900</ref><ref>{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 919</ref>

==Inspiration==
An undead witch-king named ''Þráinn'' appears in ''[[:Wikipedia:Hrómundar saga Gripssonar|Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''. It is possible that this was Tolkien's source of inspiration.{{fact}}

<!-- I think that the Shapeskearean inspiration is told in Carpenter's biography -->
The prophecy that the Witch-king would fall ""not by the hand of man"" and the fulfillment of the prophecy occurring as a technicality (being slain by a hobbit and a woman) bears a striking resemblance to the prophecy regarding the title character's death in Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'', where it was foretold that Macbeth will be slain ""not by man born of woman"" and is then killed by Macduff, born by caesarian section. Tolkien was familiar with the play, having reputedly taken inspiration for the Last March of the Ents from the same source (See article ''[[Ents]]'' for details).

==Portrayal in adaptations== 
The Witch-king's true name is never given, and therefore among [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]], the Witch-king is often simply called ''Angmar'', after the name of the realm he founded and led. It is possible that he was one of the three [[Black Númenóreans]] Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly [[Isilmo]], a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. This possibility was adopted by the now defunct [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game and [[Mithril Miniatures]] where he is named ''Er-Murazor'', a Númenórean prince and younger son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]].

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is shown with no distinction from the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]]; all are robed in brown and black, and none seem to be able to talk clearly.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is portrayed as a humanoid figure with no head. Red eyes glare under a golden crown. His dialogue is more or less as in the books, albeit in a strange and somewhat unfitting electronic voice. After a stab from behind by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Éowyn]] beheads him. It is worthy of note that the Witch-king is seen with the [[Red Eye]] of [[Barad-dûr]] as his emblem and faction, rather than the grim moon of [[Minas Morgul]].

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is called the ""Witch-king of [[Angmar]]"", the ""Lord of the [[Nazgûl]]"", and the ""Greatest of the Nine"" by [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''; however, no other mention of the kingdom of Angmar itself is made. Also, in that film, there is no mention of [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy; there is only a claim among the enemy that ""no man can kill"" the Witch-king.  Like the other Nazgûl, he is depicted as a humanoid figure shrouded in a hooded black robe; his only distinguishing feature is a mask-like spiked helmet with a huge mouth. His first mention is when Gandalf tells [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while in Minas Tirith that the Dark Lord has not yet revealed his ""deadliest"" servant: the Witch-king, the one that ""stabbed [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]]"".

:During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the Witch-king's army uses the ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] to break through the city gates early in the battle (after the failure of a lesser ram), and the Witch-king is not present to confront Gandalf as he is in the book. The confrontation takes place later, as Pippin and Gandalf race to the tombs to save [[Faramir]], and the Witch-king intercepts them. Unlike in the book, this meeting decisively favors the Witch-king, who breaks Gandalf's staff and throws the wizard to the ground before leaving to deal with the arrival of the [[Rohirrim]].  Gandalf's face shows obvious fear in this scene, in comparison to the resolution (for ""victory or death"") in the books.

:The Witch-king's final stand on the battlefield occurs with less dialogue than in the book, and the weapons used to defeat him are both mundane: Merry's sword is not a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], but rather the Rohirric sword that [[Théoden]] had as a child. This does makes it somewhat confusing in the film whether the Witch-King was truly destroyed in this fight (as he was in the book), or whether we was temporarily incapacitated (as at the ford of Bruinen) and later perished along with his fellow Nazgul due to the One Ring's destruction.

:Eight actors are known to have played some part of the Witch-king.
#An unidentified extra portrayed the ""King of Men"" in the prologue. He was chosen to be the Witch-king simply because he was the smallest of the nine.
#[[Shane Rangi]] did the horse chase.
#[[Fran Walsh]] provided the ""Ringwraith scream"".
#Effects technician Ben Price played the Witch-king in ""many scenes""<ref>http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/07/072904lotrwetaprops.html</ref>
#[[Brent McIntyre]] is officially credited as the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He stabbed Frodo.
#[[Lawrence Makoare]] filled the robe of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.
#[[Mark Ferguson]] filled the heavy armoured costume when Makoare felt claustrophobic.<ref>http://www.markferguson.net/articles/interview_Nautilus20.html</ref>
#[[Andy Serkis]] provided the voice of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is mentioned to have been defeated years ago, and his body sealed by the ""Men of the North"" in a very deep and dark tomb in the ""[[High Fells of Rhudaur]]"". His [[wraith]], apparently summoned by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], is encountered by [[Radagast]] in the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]], but the [[Wizards|Wizard]] fends him off and salvages the Witch-king's [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] in the struggle.

:In the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]], The Witch-King, along with the other Nazgûl, participates by fighting [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]], members of the [[White Council]]. In the end, he and the other Nine are driven back to [[Mordor]] by [[Galadriel]] and her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], [[Sauron|his master]] also eventually following suit.

:No actor is known to have played the Witch-king in this film series.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The role of The Lord of the Nazgul, as he is always credited in this production, is expanded with material from ''[[The Hunt for the Ring]]''. He is the second speaking character in the series: he is the one who captures [[Gollum]], though he is not identified as such until the credits. [[Philip Voss]] provided the voice for The Lord of the Nazgul.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]'':'''
:The Witch-king's role and voice are similar to that of the film, but his appearance is different. An early helmet design, that had been removed from the film because it resembled [[Sauron]]'s helm too much, was used here, presumably because there was no time to make a new character model.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Witch-King is one the main ""Hero"" units for the Servants of Sauron, his signature ability is being able to turn Wights into Nazgûl. The evil campaign storyline shows him reclaiming Dol Guldur for Sauron.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Witch-King is a ""Hero"" unit for Mordor faction. He is an airborne unit riding on a Fell Beast and one of the strongest units in the game.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:In addition to his appearance from the first game, the Witch-King can now also dismount and become a landscape unit armed with a mace. An expansion was released for this game the same year, titled [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]. In this expansion, the campaign is centered around the Witch-King and his rise to power in Angmar. 

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Witch-king is a non-playable character present in several scenes. His most memorable appearance takes place in the Great Barrow within the Barrow-Downs. There are also multiple references to him in quest dialogue, the most notable is that the Witch-King for whatever reason cannot return to rule [[Carn Dum]] and instead has erected a Steward named [[Mordirith]] to rule in his place, in mockery of the Stewards of Gondor.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:In the campaign for the ""Evil"" side, the Witch-King is revived by other Nazgûl right before Sauron reclaims The One Ring.

''''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:The Witch-king appears in a flashback of the playable characters during the prologue of the game. He and the other [[Nazgûl]] attack and destroy the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] camp at [[Sarn Ford]].

The Witch-king commands him to return and attack immediately, to aid in the [[Hunt of the Ring]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

'''2012: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Witch-King is a playable defender. He is equipped with a flail and specialises in controlling effects. His ''Death'' ability causes damage, reduces enemy healing and reanimates a fallen enemy to fight for him. ''Darkness'' forces an enemy to turn back and fight, preventing escape and reflecting damage. ''Malice''  causes Damage in area and improves his next attack. ''Despair''  slows a targeted Enemy and nearby Enemies.

''''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:The Witch-king is featured in the game. Voiced by Matthew Mercer, he serves as the main antagonist of the game. At the bidding of Sauron, he leads the siege on the city of Minas Ithil, making an adversary out of [[Talion]], in whom he takes a particular interest. Ensnaring General Castamir by promising the safety of his daughter, Idril, the Witch-king conquers the city for the Dark Lord. Using a [[palantír]] within Minas Ithil - now Minas Morgul - he sees that [[Celebrimbor]]'s New Ring is in [[Shelob]]'s hands.

'''Blodren''' was character from earlier versions of the legendarium whose role as betrayer of [[Túrin]] was replaced by [[Mîm]].

== History ==
Blodren son of [[Ban]] was an [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]] who was captured by [[Morgoth]] and tormented because he was one of the faithful that had withstood [[Uldor|Uldor the Accursed]].

Thus their hideout was surrounded and taken. Túrin was captured alive and carried towards [[Angband]]; but Beleg was left for dead among the slain.<ref name=""Blodren"">{{GA|265}}</ref>

'''Bór the Faithful''' was, along [[Ulfang]], one of the two greatest chieftains of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] that moved into [[Beleriand]] during the late [[First Age]].

== History ==
Bór's people came into [[Beleriand]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]].

This loyalty came at the cost of his life. The Elves, grateful for his loyalty,  posthumously awarded him the title ""Faithful"".{{fact}}

'''Lorgan''' was the chief of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]] forces that occupied [[Hithlum]].  

== History ==
After [[Morgoth]]'s victory in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Lorgan's people were given parts of the [[Northlands]]. Lorgan claimed the lordship of the northern land of [[Dor-lómin]], which had been ruled by [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] until he was captured in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]].

=== Lorgan and Tuor ===
Lorgan's [[Men]] and [[Orcs]] launched an attack on the [[Elves]] that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old [[Tuor]] to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years, after which he managed to escape. He harried the lands as an outlaw, and Lorgan put a price on his head, but after a further four years Tuor disappeared from the north. Lorgan surely never discovered why his foe had vanished: Tuor had set out through the [[Gate of the Noldor]] on a journey that would lead him to [[Turgon]] in [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

=== Lorgan and Húrin ===
Hearing of [[Nienor|Nienor's]] beauty, Lorgan was eager to take her by force. However, [[Morwen]] and her daughter managed to escape to [[Doriath]], seeking the news of [[Túrin]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, entry for the year 494, p. 256</ref>

Twenty-eight years after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Morgoth pretended pity for the steadfastness of Húrin Thalion who was his prisoner all these years; in actuality it was part of a plan to spread his malice.  In a cunning stroke, Morgoth sent Húrin to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honour. This caused the people of Hithlum, both the Easterlings and the enslaved [[Men of Dor-lómin]] to believe that Húrin was in league with the Dark Lord. Húrin's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion. He was allowed to wander about the land untouched due to the Easterlings' fear that to do so would put them in Morgoth's disfavour.

Húrin acquired only a small following, composed of [[Asgon]] and six others. Deciding to leave Hithlum, Húrin marched up to the halls of Lorgan to look upon him and his men in scorn and to announce his departure. Lorgan was glad that Húrin was going and asked his ""friend"" to tell Morgoth that Húrin had not been ill-treated during his stay. Húrin rejected Lorgan's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Morgoth was a lie. At this, Lorgan's men drew swords to kill Húrin but Lorgan restrained them. More cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived the purpose of Morgoth in letting Húrin go free. He told Húrin to go and wished him ill.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 252-254</ref>

'''Uldor the Accursed''' was the eldest son<sup>[[Uldor#Uldor's year of birth|NB]]</sup> of [[Ulfang]] the Black.<ref name=Ulf/>

He was called ""the Accursed"" most likely due to his role as the leader of the infamous treachery of his [[Folk of Uldor|folk]] in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]].

== History ==
After entering [[Beleriand]], Uldor along with his father and his brothers joined the service of [[Caranthir]],<ref name=Ulf>{{S|18}}</ref> and settled in [[Thargelion]].<ref name=Thar/>

Ultimately though, his father Ulfang's purpose from the beginning was to eventually betray the [[Elves]],<ref>{{GA|174}}, pp. 60-1, ''footnote''</ref> which his sons ultimately did in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], under Uldor's leadership - they turned against their allies, attacking them in the rear. Their betrayal proved crucial in the fight against Morgoth's forces, though, and Morgoth was victorious.<ref name=Nirn/>

However, Uldor's brothers [[Ulfast]] and [[Ulwarth]] were killed by the sons of [[Bór]], who remained loyal to the sons of [[Fëanor]] during the battle - while Uldor himself was slain by [[Maglor]].<ref name=Nirn>{{S|20}}</ref>

A curious thing about the name ''Uldor'' is that it remained unchanged from its conception to the later [[legendarium]].

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Earlier versions of the ''[[Nirnaeth]]'' ===
According to earlier versions of the legendarium, instead of being killed by Maglor in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Uldor was slain by Cranthir (an earlier name for Caranthir) instead.<ref>{{SM|7I}}, entry '''172''', p. 302</ref><ref>{{LR|AB}}, entry '''272''', p. 137</ref>

It is only in ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' (c. [[1951]]) that the story of Uldor's death at Maglor's hand appears, as well as the idea that Uldor summoned more Men from east of Beleriand.<ref>{{GA|231}}, entry '''472''', p. 74</ref><ref>{{GA|231|note}}, p. 134</ref>

=== Uldor's year of birth ===
In the appendix of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' in ''[[The Genealogies]]'' (dating from the early [[1930]]s), it is stated that Uldor was born in the year 125.<ref>{{LR|A1}}, p. 403</ref>

When comparing the above date with its associated text ''[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]]'', Uldor was born 38 years before the [[Swarthy Men]] entered Beleriand in the year 163.<ref>{{SM|7I}}, entry '''year 163''', p. 300</ref>

Also, the dates found in ''The Earliest Annals of Beleriand'' were by and large moved 300 years into the future in ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' (c. early [[1950]]s), such that, for example, an event happening in the year 195 in ''The Earliest Annals'' now happened in the year {{FA|495|n}}.<ref>{{SM|7Ic}}, ''Annals 155 to 157'', pp. 319-20</ref>

=== Later legendarium ===
In the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'', an entirely new conception of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears (''Nirnaeth Arnoediad'') emerged.

According to that conception, the eastern army of Maedhros (called ''Maedros'' in this text) never rendezvoused with the western army of [[Fingon]] and [[Turgon]] at all - in other words, they were not simply delayed due to the actions of Uldor, but were completely cut off from the western army by a large host of [[Orcs]] and were subsequently routed.

And while the idea of the treachery of the Easterlings was retained, it was only mentioned in passing.<ref>{{WJ|One}}, ""Note 2 (''A further account of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears'')"", pp. 165-8</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Even though Ulfang was the instigator of the betrayal of the Easterlings, he is not mentioned to have taken part in the battle, and it is noted that his son Uldor was the leader of the treason.

In the appendix of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' in ''[[The Genealogies]]'' (dating from the early [[1930]]s), it is stated that Ulfand the Swart (an earlier name for ''Ulfang'') was born in the year 100, and died in 170.<ref>{{LR|A1}}, p. 403</ref>

However, even though Morgoth pledged better lands to Ulfang, Ulfast's father, he ultimately reneged on his promise and exiled the remainder of his people (under the leadership of Ulfast and Ulwar) to [[Hithlum]], which was an unfertile and desolate land; Morgoth also forbade them from ever journeying to other lands.

Afterwards, the folk of Ulfast and Ulwar brutally oppressed the remaining native folk of [[House of Hador|Hádor]] who were already living there before their arrival.<ref>{{LR|AB}}, entry '''273''', p. 138</ref>

=== Ulfast's year of birth ===
In the appendix of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' in ''[[The Genealogies]]'' (dating from the early [[1930]]s), it is stated that Ulfast was born in the year 128.<ref>{{LR|A1}}, p. 403</ref>

'''Ulwarth''' was the youngest son<sup>[[Ulwarth#Ulwar's year of birth|NB]]</sup> of [[Ulfang]] the ''Black''.<ref name=Ulf/>

== History ==
After entering [[Beleriand]], Ulwarth along with his father and his brothers joined the service of [[Caranthir]].<ref name=Ulf>{{S|18}}</ref>

Ultimately though, his father Ulfang's purpose from the beginning was to eventually betray the [[Elves]],<ref>{{GA|174}}, pp. 60-1, ''footnote''</ref> which he and his brothers ultimately did in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], under the leadership of [[Uldor]] the Accursed - they turned against their allies, attacking them in the rear. Their betrayal proved crucial in the fight against Morgoth's forces, though, and Morgoth was victorious.<ref name=Nirn/>

However, Ulwarth, as well as his brother [[Ulfast]] were killed by the sons of [[Bór]], who remained loyal to the sons of [[Fëanor]] during the battle - while Ulwarth's brother Uldor was slain by [[Maglor]].<ref name=Nirn>{{S|20}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Ulwarth'' was probably not the character's true name, as it seems to be [[Sindarin]] for ""Ugly betrayer"": ''[[ul-]]'' (""ugly"") + ''[[gwarth]]'' (""betrayer"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1540871845.html|articlename=S.

== Other names ==
An earlier name for the character was ''Ulwar'', afterwards changed to ''Ulwarth''.<ref>{{SM|7Ic}}, entry '''Annal 163''', p. 320</ref>

<center>{{Quote|Radagast is, of course, a worthy wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends.|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Council of Elrond]]""}}</center>

'''Radagast the Brown''', also known as '''Hrávandil''' and '''Aiwendil''', was a [[Maia]] who was sent  to [[Middle-earth]] as
one of the [[Five Guardians|Guardians]] to protect the [[Elves]] against [[Morgoth]] at the beginning of the [[First Age]] and later as one of the [[Wizards]] to contest the will of [[Sauron]] in the [[Third Age]]. Chosen for his later mission by the Valië [[Yavanna]], he had a strong affinity for animals. Radagast dwelt, for a time, at [[Rhosgobel]] on the western eaves of [[Mirkwood]], near the [[Gladden Fields]] and the [[Anduin|Great River]] in the Third Age.

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - Mage of Rhosgobel.jpg|thumb|left|''Mage of Rhosgobel'' by [[Jef Murray]]]]
The [[Maia]] Aiwendil was an [[Ainu]] who existed before [[Time]], and one of the [[spirits]] who descended to [[Arda]] in order to serve the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> Aiwendil was associated with the Valië [[Yavanna]], the Queen of earth.<ref name=""IstariTables"">{{UT|Istari}}, tables relating the Istari to the Valar</ref>

In the beginning of the [[First Age]], after the Vala [[Oromë]] discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Aiwendil was sent by the Valar as one of five other great spirits of the Maiar as a [[Five Guardians|Guardian]] to Cuiviénen to protect the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]]. He was known there by the name ''Hrávandil''. It is unclear in which shape he came there, how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]].<ref>{{NM|Dates}}, TEXT 1, p. 95</ref>

After the defeat of [[Morgoth]], the Valar grew concerned about the growing power of [[Sauron]] in [[Middle-earth]]. Manwë summoned a council of the [[Valar]], and it was decided that they would send Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth to aid the [[Free Peoples]]. [[Aulë]] chose [[Saruman|Curumo]] and Manwë chose [[Gandalf|Olórin]]. Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him,<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, narrative of a council of the Valar</ref> Curumo was obliged to do so to please Yavanna.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, page of jottings belonging to the same period</ref> The Valar forbade them to match Sauron's power with power or to use force or fear to dominate the Elves and [[Men]]<ref>{{App|TA}}, introduction to the Tale of Years of the Third Age, p. 1085</ref>, such as to reveal themselves in majestic forms or open displays of power<ref name=""UTIstari"" />. Instead, they were asked to advise and persuade Elves and Men and were sent in weak and humble real bodies that resembled old [[Men]]. As a consequence, they could experience fear, pain, weariness, hunger, thirst and could be killed. However, due to their spirits they aged only slowly.<ref name=""UTIstari"" />

In c. {{TA|1000}}, Aiwendil who was clothed in earthen brown, Curumo, and Olórin arrived upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old [[Men]], whom the peoples called [[Wizards]].<ref name=""UTIstari""/>

===Travels in Middle-earth===
When the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but Radagast was never much of a traveller.<ref name=""CouncilP256"">{{FR|Council}}, p. 256</ref> There is not much to be told about his early journeys, but by the late [[Third Age]] he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time at least, at [[Rhosgobel]] near the borders of [[Mirkwood]]<ref name=""CouncilP256""/> near its southern end,<ref name=""Queer"">{{H|Queer}}</ref> probably on its western side south of the [[Gladden Fields]] and opposite of the [[East Bight]]<ref>{{TI|MII}}, in the middle of map square L13, p. 305</ref>. He received his name Radagast from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=""IstariNote4"">{{UT|Istari}}, note 4</ref> Living on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed that the Wizard held watch against the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] that slowly engulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the inhabitants of that region. He was friends with animals, especially birds, including the [[eagles|Great Eagles]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 257 and 261</ref> Although the neighboring [[Beorn]] was unsociable, he used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast ""not a bad fellow"" for a Wizard.<ref name=""Queer"" />

In {{TA|2851}}, the [[White Council]] met once more and, after that, Saruman began to search near the [[Gladden Fields]] for the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2851, p. 1088</ref> Radagast decided to aid his search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that Saruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the Ring for himself.<ref name=""SRings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

[[File:Angelo Montanini - Radagast.jpg|thumb|''Radagast'' by [[Angelo Montanini]]]]
By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Radagast did not dwell any more in Rhosgobel. In summer {{TA|3018}} Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once. Radagast did not know much of [[Eriador]] but sought for [[the Shire]], knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.<ref name=""FRCouncil"">{{FR|Council}}, pp. 256-7</ref>

Indeed, on [[Mid-year's Day|Midsummer's Day]],<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, June Mid-year's Day, p. 1091</ref> Radagast was sitting on the side of the [[Greenway]] with his horse near [[Bree]] when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the [[Nazgûl]] were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of [[the Shire]]. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to [[Orthanc]]. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.<ref name=""FRCouncil""/>

By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of [[Gwaihir]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 257-61</ref>

Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the [[Council of Elrond]], many scouts were sent out from [[Rivendell]] to many different locations. Some passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] and eventually came to [[Rhosgobel]], but they found that Radagast was not there.<ref name=""FRSouth"">{{FR|South}}, p. 274</ref>

==Characteristics==
Radagast was associated with the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Yavanna]],<ref name=""IstariTables"">{{UT|Istari}}, tables relating the Istari to the Valar</ref> who loved plants<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref> and had planted the seeds for plants in [[Arda]]<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>. He was perhaps a member of the ""people"" of Yavanna.<ref name=""IstariTables"" />

Radagast had much less power and wisdom than [[Saruman]] or [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note about the Istari from 1972</ref> Gandalf esteemed him as ""a worthy Wizard""<ref name=""CouncilP257"">{{FR|Council}}, p. 257</ref>, but Saruman scorningly gave him the bynames ""'''the Bird-tamer'''"", ""'''the Simple'''"" and ""'''the Fool'''""<ref name=""CouncilP258"">{{FR|Council}}, p. 258</ref>.

Radagast was ""a master of shapes and changes of hue"".<ref name=""CouncilP257"" /> He fell in love with the beasts and birds of Middle-earth<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, essay on the Istari</ref> and knew much about herbs and animals<ref name=""CouncilP257"" />. Beasts and birds were his friends.<ref name=""CouncilP257"" /> Gandalf, however, held greater knowledge of birds and beasts than Radagast, as well as greater respect and affection received from them. Radagast found beasts and birds easier to deal with and interacted very little with [[Elves]] or [[Men]].<ref>{{NM|Descriptions}}, Gandalf, p. 193</ref><ref name=""RC.245"">{{HM|RC}}, p. 245</ref>

Radagast only had short, curling, light brown hair on his chin (instead of a full beard) when he appeared in the body of a man in the [[Third Age]].<ref name=""Beards"" />

==Etymology==
In a very late note written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in [[1972]] the name is said to be derived from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] and that its meaning is ""not now clearly interpretable"".<ref name=""IstariNote4"" />

In a manuscript written by Tolkien in [[1954]], the name ''Radagast'' is said to be ""in the tongue of Númenor of old"" and to mean ""tender of beasts"".<ref name=""UTIstari""/> [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests that it is possible that Tolkien did not mean classical [[Adûnaic]], but [[Westron]], which was descended from Adûnaic.<ref name=HHO>{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 278, 291</ref>

John D. Rateliff and [[Douglas A. Anderson]] suggest the name of the [[Gothic]] chieftain ''[[Wikipedia:Radagaisus|Radagaisus]]'', whose name (as noted by [[David Salo]]) is rendered ''Rhadagast'' in some works from the 18th and 19th century (e.g., ''King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Boethius' De Consolatione Philosophiae'', translated by J.S. Cardale in 1829) as a source of inspiration. They also suggest the name of the Slavic god [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radegast_%28god%29 ''Radegast''] (mentioned by the eleventh-century german historian Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hamburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum and nineteenth-century german writer Jacob Grimm in Teutonic Mythology) or ''Redigast''.<ref name=HHO/><ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 167</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 240-241</ref> John D. Rateliff also suggests that it may be an [[Old English]] name, which means ""Spirit of the Road"" and consistings of the components ''rad'' (""road"") and ''gast'' (""spirit"", ""angel"", ""human being""). John D. Rateliff suggests that the name of the Gothic king is the most convincing source of inspiration, because of J.R.R. Tolkien's interest in the Gothic language and his knowledge of Gothic history.<ref name=HHO/> [[Tom Shippey]] mentions that Edward Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' stayed in Tolkien's mind and that ''Radagaisus'' is included in its index.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''The Road to Middle-earth'', Appendix A Tolkien's Sources: The True Tradition, 3rd edition, p. 396</ref>

Mark Fisher suggests the old [[Old English]] name ''rudugást'' (""red-brown spirit"") from ''rudu'' (""red"" or ""red brown"")<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/26011|articlename=rudu|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> and ''gást'' (""spirit"")<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/13319|articlename=GÁST|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> as a source for the name Radgast.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/r/radagast.php|articlename=Radagast|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>

[[Jason Fisher]] suggests the [[Old Norse]] word ''ráðgast'' (""to take counsel"") as a source for the name Radagast.<ref>{{webcite|author=Jason Fisher|articleurl=http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2007/12/thinking-about-radagast.html|articlename=Thinking about Radagast|website=Lingwë|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>

==Other names==
{{Pronounce|Quenya - Aiwendil.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
The name ''Aiwendil'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Lover of Birds"".<ref>{{UT|13a}}, note 6</ref> It is obviously derived from ''[[aiwë]]'' (""a small bird"") + ''[[-ndil]]'' (""devoted to"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 241</ref>

Another Quenya name was ''Hrávandil'', used when he was sent to [[Cuiviénen]] with the other [[Five Guardians|Guardians]], which according to [[Carl Hostetter]] most likely means ""Wild beast friend"", from ''hravan'' (""wild beast"") and ''-ndil'' (""friend"").<ref>{{NM|Dates}}, Notes, note 7, p. 102</ref>

As one of the [[Wizards]] sent to [[Middle-earth]], he was known as ""Radagast '''the Brown'''"".<ref name=""CouncilP256"" /><ref name=""CouncilP258"" /> It is possible that he received this byname, because of the earthen brown colour of the clothes that he wore when he arrived in Middle-earth in c. {{TA|1000}}. The bynames of Saruman and Gandalf, ""the White""<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, p. 48</ref><ref name=""CouncilP258"" /> and ""the Grey""<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 254</ref>, respectively,<ref name=""CouncilP258"" /> matched the colour of their clothes and the other two Wizards who wore sea-blue clothes were called ""the Blue Wizards""<ref name=""UTIstari""/>.

[[Saruman]], when talking to [[Gandalf]], mocked Radagast by calling him ""Radagast the Bird-tamer"", ""Radagast the Simple"", and ""Radagast the Fool"".<ref name=""CouncilP258"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
From the first drafts of ''The Hobbit'', [[Gandalf|Bladorthin]] identifies Radagast as a fellow wizard and as his ""cousin"". [[John D. Rateliff]] notes that, at this stage in the development of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[legendarium]] there was no reason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that it is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence (following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by saying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the attack on the [[Sauron|Necromancer]].<ref name=""HHMedwed"">{{HH|Medwed}}, ""(vi) Radagast""</ref>

Early in the process of writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it is clear that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale.<ref>{{RS|New}}, p. 379;{{RS|Elrond}}, p. 397</ref> He eventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting Gandalf to Isengard.<ref name=""TIC1.130-140"">{{TI|C1}}, pp. 130-140</ref>

Initially Gandalf describes Radagast as his ""cousin"",<ref>{{TI|C1}}, p. 131</ref> as he did in ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref name=""Queer"" /> but in a subsequent draft he becomes his ""kinsman"".<ref>{{TI|C2}}, p. 149</ref> In the final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is ""one of my order"".<ref name=""FRCouncil""/>

Tolkien initially called him ""Radagast '''the Grey'''"", but in pencil he changed this to ""Brown"" and subsequently Saruman refers to him as ""Radagast the Brown"".<ref name=""TIC1.130-140""/>

When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered Gandalf evicting Saruman from Isengard and handing it over to Radagast after the fall of Mordor.<ref>{{TI|Story}}, p. 212</ref>

===Films===
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Radagast is entirely omitted. Without Radagast's involvement, [[Gandalf]] goes to [[Isengard]] of his own accord (because he wanted counsel from [[Saruman]]) and is able to escape from the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]] by speaking to a moth who sends for the help of the [[Eagles]].

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Although Radagast is only briefly mentioned in ''The Hobbit'', Radagast features in ''The Hobbit'' films and is played by [[Sylvester McCoy]].<ref name=""IMCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> He is highly eccentric and somewhat absent-minded, and also uses a sled pulled by several large [[rabbits]] (which he refers to as '[[Rhosgobel]] Rabbits') as his main means of transportation.

:After discovering that a shadow has fallen on [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] (having had to heal his hedgehog friend [[Sebastian]] because of its power), Radagast enters [[Dol Guldur]] and is attacked by the [[Witch-king]]. He finds that the fortress is occupied by a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] and travels to inform Gandalf. He finds [[Thorin and Company]] just west of [[Rivendell]] and hands Gandalf a [[Morgul-knife|morgul blade]]. He draws a pack of [[Wargs]] and their [[Orcs|Orc]] riders away on his rabbit-pulled sled so that Thorin and Company can flee in safety.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Radagast briefly appears, investigating the [[High Fells of Rhudaur|High Fells]] with Gandalf, and accompanying him to Dol Guldur. Gandalf then dispatches him to send news of what they've found to [[Galadriel]], while Gandalf enters the fortress ruins alone.

'''Bill Ferny''' was a man of [[Bree]], known to be an associate of the [[Nazgûl]] and later, a ruffian of the [[Ruffians|Chief's Men]].

==Description==
Descriptions of Ferny's appearance are limited to his being a ""swarthy Bree-lander""<ref name=""FRI9"">{{FR|I9}}</ref> or a ""sneery swarthy fellow.""<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

==History==
Bill Ferny lived in the last house of Bree, and was an opportunistic backstabber who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He also served as a spy for the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], and relayed information about [[Shire-hobbits]] to them.

On [[September 29]]th of {{TA|3018|n}}, Ferny and his [[Squint-eyed southerner|associate]] were at [[The Prancing Pony]] when the two of them saw [[Mr. Underhill]] vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the Black Riders.<ref name=""UT10"">{{UT|10}}, ""Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire""</ref>
[[File:Cor Blok - Bill Ferney hit by an apple.jpg|thumb|100px|left|""Bill Ferney hit by an apple"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
After reporting to the Black Riders, Ferny and his allies went to the inn's stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Bree: [[Bill the Pony|Bill's mistreated one]]. He sold him for twelve [[silver pennies]] to [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]]. As a parting gift, [[Samwise Gamgee]] threw an [[apples|apple]] at his head.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

Ferny's associate was spotted inside his house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name=""FRI11"">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

After the [[Ruffians]] among the [[Southerners]] were kicked out of Bree, it was believed by [[Barliman Butterbur]] that Bill Ferny and [[Harry Goatleaf]] opened the gates to let them in since the two of them sided with Ruffians in the battle that followed.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> After fleeing Bree with the Ruffians, he threw in his lot with the [[Sharkey's Men|Men]] serving [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] in the [[Shire]]. He guarded the outer gate at the [[Brandywine Bridge]] as the Chief's Big Man and his command over the local [[Shirriffs]] was hard. When the four [[Travellers]] returned to the Shire, he attempted to threaten them, but was threatened by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] in turn, and as such he fled into the night after giving him the gate key, though not until after his old pony had kicked him in his back. He was never heard of again.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bill'' is a name Tolkien used to represent the [[Westron]] name '''Bil''', which was a short for names as ''Arambil'', ''Bildad'' and ''Bilcuzal'', all of unknown meaning.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> ''Ferny'' is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Fern|plant]], as many surnames of [[Bree]] were botanical in nature.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an earlier draft of [[The Scouring of the Shire]], it is Frodo who threatens Ferny rather than Merry. Later, Sam compares [[Ted Sandyman]] to Ferny.<ref>{{SD|Shire}}, pp. 80, 88-9</ref>

:A character credited as ""Bill Ferny Sr."" appears in the prologue in Bree. Along with him associate, another character credited as ""Squint"" (loosely based on the squint-eyed southerner), Ferny, Sr. has seemingly tracked [[Thorin]] to the Prancing Pony (presumably to collect on the bounty put out on Thorin's head by [[Azog]]). The two Men are preparing to confront Thorin when [[Gandalf]] goes over and sits and starts talking with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]. When it becomes apparent the Wizard is not going anywhere, the two Men get up and leave the inn.

'''Harry Goatleaf''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] and a member of the [[Goatleaf Family]].

== History ==
Harry Goatleaf worked as a [[Gate-keepers|Gate-keeper]] stationed at the [[West-gate of Bree|western gate]] in the great hedge that surrounded the township of [[Bree]].<ref name=Gate>{{FR|I9}}</ref> On [[23 September]], [[Strider]] observed the [[Nazgûl]] having a conversation with Goatleaf before leaving him white and shaking.<ref name=Monday>{{FR|I10}}</ref> When [[Frodo Baggins]] and his [[Travellers|companions]] arrived at the town, he got a lantern and questioned them gruffly about their intentions, silently observing that they came from the [[Shire]] before letting them in. Before wishing them good night, he warned them that there would be more folk besides him at ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' who would ask them questions.<ref name=Gate/>

After [[Strider]] advised the four [[Hobbits]] to be more careful as the [[Nazgûl]] were seen passing the [[Greenway]] the previous [[Monday]], Frodo realized that he should have known this from the way the Goatleaf spoke. Later, when Strider predicts that something may happen that night before they leave Bree, he mentioned that the Goatleaf may be a spy for the Nazgûl, noting the conversation he had overheard.<ref name=Monday>{{FR|I10}}</ref>

Before the end of {{TA|3018}}, the [[Men of Bree]] kicked the [[Ruffians]] among the [[Southerners]] out of Bree. Early in the [[New Year]] however, the town was attacked in the night by the very same Ruffians. During the battle, Goatleaf fought on the side of the Ruffians along with [[Bill Ferny]]. After the battle, Goatleaf left Bree alongside the other Ruffians, hiding out in either the [[Chetwood]] beyond [[Archet]], or in the wilds north of Bree. Later, it was believed by [[Barliman Butterbur]] that Goatleaf and Ferny were the ones who let the Ruffians in on the night of the battle.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> Goatleaf's position as a Gate-keeper was presumably later taken by another Gate-keeper.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an early draft, Harry Goatleaf whispered with Bill Ferney and the [[squint-eyed southerner]] in a corner of the Prancing Pony and slipped out behind them after Frodo's song. He is described later on in the draft as ""''a mean old curmudgeon''"". In another draft, [[Gandalf]] is at the gate and asks Goatleaf if he had seen any Shire-hobbits. Goatleaf revealed that he did not as he was in [[Staddle]] and his brother, [[Ned Goatleaf|Ned]], was at the gate in his place. After advising Gandalf to head to the inn, he shut the gate. Later in this draft, the Black Riders came to the gate and Harry revealed Gandalf's entry. A few moments later, when Frodo passed through, he was more friendly than in the published text, and the dialogue was slightly expanded.<ref>{{RS|Sign}}, pp. 333-4, 336, 342, 344-5, 347-9, 354</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:Harry Goatleaf makes a brief appearance early in the second episode of the radio series. He is portrayed by an uncredited actor (making him the only notable character in the entire series to go uncredited).

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''''':
:Harry Goatleaf (portrayed by [[Martyn Sanderson]]) is never named, but is referred to as the '''Gate Keeper''' in the end credits. Unlike the novel, he doesn't seem to be in league with the Black Riders. In fact, he is killed when the Black Riders knock the gate down and crush him underneath it as they storm Bree.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)]]''''':
:Harry Goatleaf is first encountered as one of the patrons in the Prancing Pony Inn, where he warns Frodo that suspicious folk have been seen in Bree, and seemingly shows concern for Frodo's safety and well-being. He is later seen in a cutscene opening the town's gates and letting wolves loose into the streets. After this, he is never seen again. He is voiced by an uncredited [[Tom Kane]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Harry Goatleaf is found at the west gate of [[Bree]], and for a long time he was not involved in any quests. He later appeared alongside [[Bill Ferny]] as one of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' enforcers in the [[Shire]] and participated in the attack on the [[Prancing Pony]] during the winter of [[Third Age 3019|3019]].

The '''King of the Mountains''', or later, the '''King of the Dead''', was the ruler of the [[Oathbreakers]].

== History ==
He was the King of the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]], and when the [[Realms in Exile]] were founded, he met [[Isildur]] at [[Erech]] and swore his affiliation to [[Gondor]] on behalf of his people.

Then the time came when their former lord, [[Sauron]] arose again, and Isildur summoned them, but the Men of the Mountains were unwilling to turn against Sauron as they worshipped him during the [[Dark Years]]. Isildur cursed them for not fulfilling their oath, that there will be no other King after him, and they will never find rest until someone else calls for them.

His people dwindled and in the following centuries, the [[Wraiths|wraith]] of the '''King of the Dead''' was a terrifying rumour for the [[Gondorians|Men of Gondor]] south of the Mountains.

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Aragorn]] came to the [[Paths of the Dead]] as the [[Heir of Isildur]] and offered them a way to redeem themselves. On their way to Erech, people were scared of the news that the King of the Dead was out again, and defenders and foes alike fled away.<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> 

The Oathbreakers followed the [[Grey Company]] to [[Pelargir]] where they drove off the enemy. Having fulfilled their oath, the King of the Dead broke and threw down his spear, bowed to [[Aragorn]] and turned away, as the Shadow Host vanished.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The King of the Dead is named Rioc. Although his men were unwilling to fight [[Sauron]] because they had worshipped him, his excuse for not honoring the oath given to [[Isildur]] was because his daughter Bravantel had an out-of-wedlock child with one of his [[Númenórean]] warriors. He leads his people after joining [[Aragorn]]'s host and is freed after the liberation of [[Pelargir]].

'''Galweg''' was a [[Gnome]], one of the [[Rodothlim]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name=Gal>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 82-3</ref>

== History ==
Galweg was the father of [[Failivrin]], who fell in love with [[Túrin]] when he and his friend [[Flinding]] lived in the [[Nargothrond|caverns of the Rodothlim]],<ref group=note>The name ''Nargothrond'' did not yet appear at this point in the legendarium.</ref><ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, p. 123</ref> ruled by [[Orodreth]]. He was fond of Túrin, and they often aided one another.<ref name=Gal/>

Galweg was killed during [[Melko]]'s [[Fall of Nargothrond#Other versions of the legendarium|attack on the Rodothlim]].<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 84</ref> His dwelling was later occupied by [[Mîm]] the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], who was in turn further slain by [[Úrin]], Túrin's father.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 113-4</ref>

==Etymology==
While ''Galweg'' is not directly glossed, in [[Gnomish]] ''gal'' means ""shine (golden, as the Sun)""<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref>{{rp|37}} and ""weg"" is a masculine suffix.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', written not long after ''The Book of Lost Tales'', Failivrin's father became Orodreth, and the character of Galweg had disappeared entirely.<ref>{{LB|1d}}, p. 91</ref>

'''Valwë''' was the father of [[Lindo]], the keeper of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] on [[Tol Eressëa]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name=""Valw"">{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref>

== History ==
Valwë followed the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Salmar#Other versions of the legendarium|Noldorin]] back to the [[Great Lands]] after the [[Fall of Gondolin]] in order to free the [[Gnomes]] who lived there under the thralldom of [[Melko]]. However, both Noldorin and Valwë were overwhelmed in the [[Battle of Tasarinan]].<ref name=""Valw""/><ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 278</ref>

Evidently he survived the battle, since it was mentioned afterwards by Lindo his son that he settled on [[Tol Eressëa]] among other figures such as [[Tulkastor]] (the father of [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]]) and [[Ingwion#Other versions of the legendarium|Ingil]] (the son of [[Ingwë#Other versions of the legendarium|Inwë]]).<ref name=""Valw""/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Valwë'' is in [[Qenya]]. Its [[Gnomish]] equivalent is '''''Gwalweg'''''. [[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that both appear to mean ""the happy (or fortunate) one"".<ref>{{PE|15}}, pp. 7, 10</ref>

Originally the name of the character was ''Manwë'', though according to [[Christopher Tolkien]] that might have merely been a slip on his father's part.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 22</ref>

'''Tulkastor''' was the father of [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]], an [[Elf]] of [[Tol Eressëa]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

Although he belonged to [[Aulë]]'s kindred, he had dwelt long with the [[Solosimpi]] and was thus one of the first [[Elves]] to come to Tol Eressëa.<ref name=""Tulk""/>

He was also the grandfather of [[Naimi]], and an ancestor of [[Heorrenda]] son of [[Eriol]].<ref name=""Naim""/> His daughter Vairë was married to [[Lindo]], the keeper of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]].<ref name=""Tulk"">{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref> 

== Etymology ==
The name ''Tulkastor'' is in [[Qenya]]. Its meaning is unclear, but it appears to contain the name of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Tulkas]] (from the root [[TULUK]]-, meaning ""steady, firm"").<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 10</ref>

== Other names ==
The [[Gnomish]] cognate of ''Tulkastor'' is '''''Tulchathron'''''.<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 7</ref>

Originally the name of the character was ''Turenbor'', later changed to ''Tulkassë'' and finally to ''Tulkastor''.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 22</ref>

'''Makar''' was one of the [[Valar]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. He is described as a ""warrior Vala"", along with his sister [[Meássë]].

== History ==
Before Makar came into [[Arda|the world]], he, along with his sister Meássë, was already a quarrelsome spirit, even going so far as to join [[Melko]] in his discord during the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 67</ref>

After arriving in [[Valinor]], Makar and Meássë built their dwellings, made of iron, in the north, close to those of [[Mandos]] and [[Fui]]. The only Vala who visited his dwelling was [[Tulkas]], who went there to wrestle and fight with Makar, although he did this only to keep his strength intact, for there was no friendship between the two.<ref name=Valar>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 77-8</ref>

Makar, along with his sister, rode often to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], where they hunted wolves and bears in the black mountains.<ref name=Valar/>

When the Valar decided to seek out Melko and oust him from his dwelling at [[Utumna]], Makar adorned them with armour.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 101</ref> After they brought Melko to Valinor for judgement, he was the only one to speak for him, being displeased with the prospect of peace.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 105</ref>

When the [[Elves]] awoke, and the Valar invited them to live among the Gods, he spoke against the others and was backed by Meássë, saying that Valinor was built for the Valar, and the Valar only.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 117</ref>

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], he joined the other Valar in pursuit of Melko, who was fleeing north towards his old stronghold. Despite the chase, Melko escaped.<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, pp. 154-5</ref> However, Makar managed to capture and slay two of Melko's servants, returning with a red hand, smeared with blood. He was the only one who had any pleasure at the time, the [[Two Trees]] having been destroyed.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 177</ref>

== Etymology ==
'''''Makar''''' is a [[Qenya]] name, meaning ""God of battle"". Its [[Gnomish]] equivalent is '''''Magorn''''' or '''''Magron'''''.<ref name=App>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 259</ref> He was also called '''''Ramandor''''' (meaning ""the Shouter"" in Qenya),<ref name=App/> as well as '''''Kostorin''''' (or '''''Gothonwi''''' in Gnomish).<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>

==History==
[[File:A-denn - Measse.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Measse'' by [[:Category:Images by A-denn|A-denn]]]]
Meássë was among the [[Ainur]] who aligned themselves with [[Melko]] during the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=""Valar"" />{{rp|67}}

Upon their arrival to [[Valinor]], she and her brother Makar made an abode in the northern [[Aman]], close to the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=""Valar"" />{{rp|79}} She, along with her brother, rode often to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], where they hunted wolves and bears in the black mountains.<ref name=""Valar"" />

When the [[Elves]] awoke, and the Valar invited them to live among the Gods, she backed Makar in his opposition to the rest of them, saying that Valinor was built for the Valar only.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 117</ref>

She joined her brother and the rest of the Valar in the pursuit of Melko and his servants, who were escaping from Valinor after the destruction of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, pp. 154-155</ref>

==Etymology==
'''''Meássë''''' is a [[Qenya]] name, deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[MEHE]] (""ooze?"") and related to the word ''mear'' (""gore""). Its [[Gnomish]] equivalent is '''''Mechos''''' or '''''Mechothli'''''.<ref name=""Ravi"" />

Among her other names was '''''Rávi''''' (related to ''ravennë'' ""she-[[lions|lion]]"").,<ref name=""Ravi"">{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 260</ref> as well as '''''Tarkil''''', deriving from the root [[TARA]] (""to batter, thud, beat"").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 15</ref>

'''Ómar''', also called '''Amillo''', was a [[Valar|Vala]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. 

== History ==
He was considered to be the youngest of all the Valar, and was the last of them to come into the world, singing songs as he entered.<ref name=III>{{LT1|III}}, p. 67</ref> Ómar knew all [[languages]] and all songs.<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 47</ref> In [[Valmar]] he would sing to the harp-playing of his brother, [[Salmar]], and his voice was the best of all voices;<ref name=Valmar>{{LT1|III}}, p. 75</ref> other times, he would be trilling in the gardens of [[Oromë]], where [[Nielíqui]] Oromë's daughter danced about its woods.<ref name=Valmar/>

From Ómar and [[Manwë]] the [[Vanyar|Teleri]]<ref group=note>In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the name ''[[Teleri]]'' refers to the group of [[Elves]] that would later be called the [[Vanyar]] in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.</ref> learned much of poetry and song.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 123</ref>

== Etymology ==
'''''Ómar''''' and '''''Amillo''''' are [[Qenya]] names. The former is related to Qenya ''ōma'' ""voice"",<ref name=Pei/> while the latter is glossed as ""one of the Happy Folk; Hilary"", where ''Hilary'' derives from Latin ''hilaris'' ""cheerful"".<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 30</ref>

The [[Gnomish]] equivalents of his names are '''''Ûmor''''' and '''''Gamlos''''' (likely meaning ""one who shouts with joy"").<ref name=Pei>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>

'''Araphant''' ({{TA|1789}}<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 195</ref> - {{TA|1964|n}},<ref name=""North"">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 175) was the fourteenth king of [[Arthedain]], and came to the throne upon the death of his father, [[Araval]], in 1891.

==History==
Despite his father's successes, [[Angmar]] rebuilt its strength and continued its attacks on Arthedain which Araphant struggled to hold off with dwindling strength.<ref name=""Elendil""/>  Arthedain had been at war with Angmar for 500 years, and this was taking its toll on the [[Dúnedain]] as their resistance was starting to fail.

It was during Araphant's reign that the long silence and estrangement between the southern kingdom of [[Gondor]] and the northern kingdom ended when Araphant took counsel with the [[King of Gondor]], [[Ondoher]]. They realised that a single force was co-ordinating the attacks on both of their kingdoms and that they should work together to combat this evil.  In {{TA|1940|n}}, Araphant's son, [[Arvedui]], married the daughter of [[Ondoher]], [[Fíriel]], in token of the new alliance between Gondor and Arthedain.<ref name=""Gondor"">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

However, the alliance proved fruitless because neither kingdom could spare help for the other.  Arthedain was soon attacked by the forces of the [[Witch-king]], whilst Gondor was under attack by the [[Wainriders]].

When Ondoher died four years later, [[Gondor]] was left kingless, so [[Arvedui]] claimed the kingship of Gondor on behalf of his wife, but the Steward [[Pelendur]] persuaded the [[Council of Gondor]] to select [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], a distant relative of Ondoher, instead. However, the heirs of Arvedui did not forget this and claimed to be the heirs of both [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]].<ref name=""Gondor""/>

Araphant ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years and was succeeded by his son, Arvedui,<ref name=""North""/> who was the last king until [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].

== Etymology ==
''Araphant'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but the Association Tolkiendil suggests that it means ""Full King"" and is a compound of ''[[aran]]'' (""king"", ""lord"", ""chief"", [lit.] high or noble person) and the nasal mutation ''phant'' of ''pant'' (""full"") (as suggested by David Salo).<ref>{{webcite|author=Association Tolkiendil|articleurl=https://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|website=Tolkiendil|accessed=04 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-753042967.html|articlename=S. ''Araphant'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=04 February 2022}}</ref> His name could be a reference to Araphant asserting himself as the [[Kings of Arnor|king]] of all [[Arnor]].

'''Anar''' was one of the four Dwarves that accompanied [[Bilbo Baggins]] on his journeys after his birthday party.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>

== History ==
In the early writings of the chapter ''[[A Long-expected Party]]'', Anar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.

== Etymology ==
Anar, or ''Anarr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""the Other"" or ""Starer"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Azaghâl''' was the [[Lord of Belegost]] during the [[First Age]]. 

==History==
===Early History===
While traveling on the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] in [[East Beleriand]], Azaghâl was waylaid by [[Orcs]]. [[Maedhros]] came to his rescue, saving his life and treasure, and as a token of gratitude, the Dwarf king gave him his [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin|helm]] made by [[Telchar]].<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, p. 75</ref>

===Union of Maedhros===
Azaghâl and his [[Dwarves of Belegost|Dwarves]] joined the [[Union of Maedhros]], and during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] covered the retreat of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] by surrounding the Dragon [[Glaurung]].  They hewed at him with their axes, for his scales were not strong enough to shield him from the blows of Dwarven axes. In his rage Glaurung struck down Azaghâl, and crawled over him.  With his last breath Azaghâl drove a knife into Glaurung's belly, so wounded him that he fled the field with many of the dismayed beasts of [[Angband]] following.  
[[File:Joona Kujanen - The Fall of Azaghal.jpg|thumb|left|Joona Kujanen - ''The Fall of Azaghal'']]
The Dwarves raised up the body of their lord and bore him away; and with slow steps they walked behind singing a dirge in deep voices, as it were a funeral pomp in their country, and gave no heed to their foes; and none dared attack them.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> [[Túrin]] would later recount the tale of Azaghâl to the [[Haladin]].<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Azaghâl'' is one of the few [[Khuzdul]] names known. It is not determined whether this was his birthname or an epithet. Its meaning is not known, but it has been argued that it is of the same [[Sundocarmë|Root]] as the [[Adûnaic]] verb ''azgara'', ""to wage war"" and even perhaps ''[[Azog]]''. ''Azaghâl'' would then mean ""warrior"".<ref>http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html</ref>

{{quote|Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. ""I see they have begun to arrive already,"" he said when he caught sight of Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and ""Balin at your service!"" he said with his hand on his breast.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[An Unexpected Party]]}}

'''Balin''' was a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] leader, the son of [[Fundin]] and elder brother of [[Dwalin]] and a member of [[Durin's Folk]]. He was [[Thorin and Company|one of the Dwarves]] that travelled with [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Gandalf]] to reclaim [[Erebor]]. When Bilbo first met Balin, the Dwarf was very old looking with a white beard and a red hood and would later become close friends with the hobbit.<ref name=""H|Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

==History==
===Early life===
Balin was born in {{TA|2763}}, the son of [[Fundin]]. When he was seven years old, [[Smaug]] invaded [[Lonely Mountain|the Lonely Mountain]]. After the Dwarves were driven out at great loss in {{TA|2770|n}}, Balin and his father [[Fundin]] lived with their king [[Thrór]] in [[Dunland]]. His brother [[Dwalin]] was born [[Third Age 2772|two years later]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|A3}}</ref>

Fundin fought in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], and was slain in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799|n}}. Balin was present at this battle but his role remains unknown.<ref group=""note"">In a note considered for inclusion in [[Appendix A]] published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien stated that Dwarves reached fighting age around thirty. Balin was 30 at the start and 36 at the end of the war, so conceivably he did participate as a warrior.</ref> The [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] under [[Thráin|Thráin II]], including Balin, at first returned to their forges in Dunland, but they moved into [[Eriador]] shortly after, and colonized the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

===Thráin's expedition===
Thráin longed to return to Erebor, and with Balin and Dwalin and a few others in {{TA|2841}} he went on an expedition to their ancient hall.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Sauron]] had them in his sights, eager to take the [[Ring of Thrór]] from the exiled king. [[Wolves]], [[Orcs]] and evil birds harassed the small company as they came east. One night, as they had crossed the [[Anduin]], an evil rain forced them into the eaves of [[Mirkwood]], and the company was split. Thráin was never seen again (captured and taken to [[Dol Guldur]]), and Balin and Dwalin returned to the Blue Mountains to report the news to [[Thorin]], the new king of Durin's line.<ref name=""Durin""/>

===Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name=""TA""/> during [[Gandalf]]'s efforts to persuade Thorin to take Bilbo to Erebor (before the party at [[Bag End]]), Balin played an important if unintentional role. When Gandalf said that ""professional stealth"" was needed Balin misunderstood him as recommending a trained treasure-hunter. As Gandalf defended hobbits in general and the particular hobbit he had in mind, stating that his hobbit had some gold, silver, and crystal, Balin again jumped to the conclusion that Bilbo was an outright thief. In his anger at this remark Gandalf proclaimed that Bilbo ''had'' to come or else the enterprise would be a failure, and Thorin then agreed to meet the hobbit. Thus Balin accidentally insured that Bilbo would be part of [[Quest of Erebor|the quest]].<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>
[[File:Darek Zabrocki - Sneaking into Camp.jpg|thumb|250px|''Sneaking into Camp'' by [[:Category:Images by Darek Zabrocki|Darek Zabrocki]]]] 
On the day of the unexpected party Balin was the second Dwarf to appear at Bag End; his comment, ""''they have begun to arrive''"" flustered the hobbit considerably, along with asking for beer. Then also him and Dwalin were the first dwarves to go help Bilbo in the kitchen after the hobbit complained. Later, when the Dwarves made music, Balin and his brother Dwalin brought in and played viols along with bringing Thorin's golden harp covered with green cloth.<ref name=""H|Party""/>

On the day after the party Balin stood at the door of the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, awaiting Bilbo's arrival.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> This was the first of many instances where Balin served as the chief look-out for Thorin's company. In fact, it was when Bilbo (wearing the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] and thus invisible) sneaked past Balin on look-out duty after their adventures with the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] in the mountains that Balin began to develop great respect for the hobbit.<ref name=""Pan"">{{H|Pan}}</ref>

Balin and his brother Dwalin tended to act together as a pair. In the clearing of the [[Wargs]] Balin and Dwalin were the two who swarmed up a tall slender fir.<ref name=""Pan""/> When the Dwarves arrived at [[Beorn]]'s [[Beorn's Hall|hall]], the two brothers were the third pair to appear.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Thorin did split the two when they crossed the [[Enchanted River]] – Balin went in the first boatload with Thorin, Bilbo, and [[Fíli]] while Dwalin came last with [[Bombur]].<ref  name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

Balin's growing fondness for Bilbo became apparent after the hobbit had rescued the Dwarves from the spiders in [[Mirkwood]]. Having seen Bilbo vanish they, especially Balin, wanted the true story of [[Gollum]] and the Ring explained. Finally satisfied as to how Bilbo had sneaked past him after the mountains, Balin called the hobbit ""Good old Bilbo"".<ref name=""Flies""/>

When the Dwarves were hauled before the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] they did not know that Thorin had been taken before them and put into a cell deep in the king's dungeon. Balin, being the second oldest of the party, became the spokes-dwarf. His angry, surly answers to Thranduil led to their confinement too.<ref name=""Barrels"">{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

Balin and Dwalin were two of the most unhappy Dwarves when unpacked from their barrels before [[Lake-town]] and were not asked to help release the others.<ref name=""Barrels""/> After leaving the town and as their ponies trudged towards the Mountain, Balin and Bilbo rode together in the rear, leading ponies laden with supplies.<ref name=""Door"">{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Visit to Bilbo.jpg|thumb|left|''Visit to Bilbo'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
That Balin had become the fondest of Bilbo of all the Dwarves was demonstrated when the hobbit made his first descent into the Lonely Mountain. None of the other Dwarves volunteered to accompany Bilbo except for Balin, who did go partway down the passageway. Balin waited there and when Bilbo returned he delightedly carried the tired hobbit back to the door.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> Later, when Bilbo dropped his torch in [[Smaug]]'s lair, Balin pointed out that it was the Dwarves' turn to help and declared that he was quite willing to go.<ref name=""Home"">{{H|Home}}</ref>

Upon escaping from Erebor, Balin led the company to [[Ravenhill]].<ref name=""Home""/> Balin later fought valiantly and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

In the autumn of {{TA|2949|n}}, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in [[the Shire]].<ref name=""TA""/> Bilbo noted that Balin's beard was many inches longer and that he wore a magnificent jewelled belt. The three friends talked for hours and Bilbo learned of the new prosperity of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the restored town of [[Dale]].<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria and his death===
[[File:Joona Kujanen - Balin, Lord of Moria.jpg|thumb|''Balin, Lord of Moria'' by [[:Category:Images by Joona Kujanen|Joona Kujanen]]]]
Though the riches of Erebor made the Dwarves prosperous again, there were many who longed to return to [[Moria]]. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] counseled against it, but Balin mounted an expedition in {{TA|2989}}.<ref name=""Many Meetings"">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> They hoped to regain the treasures, and Balin had also hoped to find the [[Ring of Thrór]], which was assumed to be lost when [[Thrór]] entered the Gates years before.<ref name=""Council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Together with [[Flói]], [[Óin]], [[Ori]], [[Frár]], [[Lóni]], [[Náli]] and many other Dwarves, Balin entered [[Dimrill Dale]]. After a short battle the group entered the [[Great Gates]]. They stayed in the [[Twenty-first Hall]], and Balin set up his throne in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]]. He proclaimed himself [[Lord of Moria]].<ref name=""Bridge"">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

For five years the colony thrived. They managed to find many old treasures such as [[Durin's Axe]], helm, mithril, and armouries. But on [[10 November]] {{TA|2994}}, as Balin went to look in [[Mirrormere]], an orc archer fatally shot him. Balin's body was placed in [[Balin's Tomb|a tomb]] in the Chamber of Mazarbul.<ref name=""Bridge""/>

But the archer was just the van of the orcs who came up the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]]. The Dwarves were trapped. After a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle in the halls]] and a [[Last stand of Balin's folk|final stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul]] the colony was completely wiped out.<ref name=""Bridge""/> Not knowing what really happened, [[Glóin]] and his son [[Gimli]] were sent to [[Rivendell]] to seek news about the colony.

Gimli eventually learned of their fate when he crossed the dwarven realm with the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] and found [[Balin's Tomb]].<ref name=""Bridge""/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Balin.mp3|Ardamir}}
Though most names of the Dwarves in ''The Hobbit'' come from the [[Völuspá]], in fact the name of every other member of Thorin's company aside from Bilbo, ''Balin'' is not one of them. The name rhymes with [[Dwalin]], but has no apparent meaning.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, ""Roast Mutton"", note 20</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Balin'' may be derived from [[Old Norse]] ''bál'' (""fire""), thus meaning ""Burning-one"". Allan also links the name to ''[[Wikipedia:Le Morte d'Arthur|Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', which includes a character named ''Balyn'' (modernized to ''Balin'' in some editions) and to a ''Beli'' of ''[[Wikipedia:Mabinogion|The Mabinogion]]''.<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 223</ref><ref group=note>It is known that Tolkien worked on editions of both ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and ''The Mabinogion''; cf. ''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'' and ''[[Pwyll Prince of Dyved]]'', respectively.</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
There are a number of differences regarding Balin as presented in early texts as opposed to the published version of ''The Hobbit''. Below is a list of noticeable differences:
* Earlier, Balin's beard was yellow instead of white, and his hood was described first as scarlet and then as yellow before red became the final choice.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 32</ref>
* Originally it was Dwalin who spotted the Trolls' fire on the hillside; later this was changed to Balin.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref>
* When Balin and others scouted the [[Front Gate]] at Erebor, in the pre-publication version referred to ravens nearby as ""spies of evil"".<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}</ref>  In the published story the suspicious birds were changed to crows.<ref name=""Door""/>

In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Balin had a son named [[Burin]] (or [[Frár]]). Burin accompanied [[Glóin]] to the [[Council of Elrond]], and became part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. The character was changed to [[Gimli]], son of Glóin in the final version.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>

After the death of Smaug, Bifur lived at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
===Family and birth===
While Bifur was descended from the Dwarves of [[Moria]], he himself was not of [[Durin]]'s line.<ref name=""Durin"" /> He was a cousin<ref name=""Inside"">{{H|Inside}}</ref> of the brothers [[Bofur]] and [[Bombur]].<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

Bifur was older than [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] (b. {{TA|2864}}<ref name=""Durin"" />) at least ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> but younger than [[Balin]] (b. {{TA|2763|n}}<ref name=""Durin"" />), since it was said that Balin was ""the eldest left"" after Thorin's capture.<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

Therefore, Bifur was born anytime between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old when he joined King [[Thorin]]'s operation to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}}, Bifur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]], wearing a yellow hood.  He asked for raspberry jam and apple-tart.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Bifur (along with [[Bofur]]) played a clarinet.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

In the wolves' glade Bifur shared a pine tree with Bofur, [[Bombur]], and Thorin.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

After the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] both Bifur and Bofur came out fairly dry and not very knocked about, but they lay down and refused to do anything.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

On the doorstep on the side of the Lonely Mountain, when Thorin commented that the next day was the beginning of the last week of autumn, Bifur pointedly added, ""And winter comes after autumn"".<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

Bifur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
By {{TA|3018}} Bifur was living in Erebor, as [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Rivendell]].<ref name=""Meetings"" />

==Etymology==
The name of ''Bívurr'' originates in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It is of Old Frisian origin, meaning ""[[Beavers|Beaver]]"" or, by extension, ""Hard Worker"".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 223</ref><ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the earliest manuscript fragments of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur and Bofur went into the hall and came back with their walking sticks, which they ''turned into'' clarinets.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 36</ref>  In the published text the two Dwarves came back from the hall with clarinets that they ''had left'' with their walking sticks.<ref name=""Party"" />  [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') said that in the earliest phase Tolkien had added fairy tale touches of Dwarven magic to emphasize the uncanny, other-worldly nature of the Dwarves as opposed to Bilbo.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, (iii) ''Dwarven Magic'', p. 54</ref>

Originally, when Bombur needed propping up in [[Mirkwood]] after being cut from the spiders' webbing, it was ''his cousins'' Bifur and Bofur who provided support.<ref>{{HH|Mirkwood}}, p. 313</ref>  In the published story this was changed to Bombur's cousin Bifur and brother Bofur.<ref name=""Flies"" />  Also, in the earlier version, when [[Smaug]] first came out and the Dwarves in the valley had to be hauled up to the [[Back Door]], Bifur cried out to save Bombur and Bofur, who were both his ''brothers''.<ref>{{HH|Conversations}}</ref>  In the published text Bifur cried out for his two ''cousins''.<ref name=""Inside"" />

In Tolkien's unfinished [[1960]] rewrite of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur, Bofur and Bombur were Thorin's attendants.<ref>{{HH|5}}, ""[[A Well-Planned Party]]"", p. 774</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] assumes this made them either courtiers or honor-guard.<ref>{{HH|5}}, ""[[Arrival in Rivendell]]"", note 32</ref>

==Notes==
In the earliest partial manuscript of ''The Hobbit'' more of the dialogue later assigned to a few of the Dwarves is more evenly distributed.  In the opinion of [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') this streamlining strengthened the story through simplification, but at the cost of relegating some of the Dwarves to obscurity since they barely speak at all.  Bifur is one of these ""silenced"" members of the company.<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, (i) ''The Lost Opening'', p. 14</ref>

'''Bodruith''' was the [[Lord of Belegost]] during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]]. He appears only in the tale of ''[[The Nauglafring]]''.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref> 

== History ==
After the attack on [[Artanor]], Bodruith, filled with greed, wanted to steal the [[Nauglamír|Nauglafring]] from [[Naugladur]] the Lord of [[Nogrod]]. At the same time, [[Ufedhin]], filled with the same lust for the necklace, stole it from Naugladur while he was asleep. Bodruith, believing that he is the rightful owner, attempted to take by surprise and murder Ufedhin to reclaim the Nauglafring. His attempt was not successful for Ufedhin had managed to kill him. When Bodruith was discovered next to Naugladur, it was thought that he was the one who tried to take the necklace and slay the Lord of Nogrod, and thus Ufedhin managed to escape.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, pp. 234-5</ref> 

== Etymology ==
The element ''bod-'' is associated with ""back"" or ""again"". The [[Gnomish]] '''''bodruith''''' means ""revenge"", thus it is speculated that he was given this name after the events of the tale of [[The Nauglafring]].<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, Appendix, p. 336</ref>

'''Bofur''' most likely lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Bofur was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Bofur lived at the Lonely Mountain in great wealth.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
=== Family and birth ===
Bofur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are that [[Bombur]] is his brother and [[Bifur]] is his cousin.<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref> He was not of Durin's line although he was descended from the Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name=""Durin""/> His birth year is also unknown. 

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was ""the eldest left"".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=""Durin""/> this would put Bofur's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}}, Bofur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]], wearing a yellow hood along with his cousin Bifur.  He asked for mince pies and cheese as also stating what Bifur and Bombur wanted also.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Bofur (along with [[Bifur]]) played a clarinet.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

After escaping the Goblins, the company was chased by wolves into a glade, Bofur shared a pine tree with Bifur, [[Bombur]], and Thorin, and later was rescued by the [[Eagles]].<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref> When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bofur, Bifur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up. The following morning, Bilbo realizes Bofur had fallen over him and then told him about breakfast left for Bilbo from the skin-changer<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Later on in [[Mirkwood]] when Bombur needed support to escape the spiders, Bifur and Bofur helped him. Then after the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] both Bofur and Bifur came out fairly dry and not very knocked about, but they lay down and refused to do anything.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> Later Bofur and Bombur would stay down to take care of the ponies, nearly killed by Smaug, though saved.

Bofur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], Thorin's cousin and now king under the mountain after Thorin's death, and made his home in Erebor along with Bifur and Bombur and the other survivors of the Battle.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
At [[Rivendell]] in {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bofur was still alive and living in Erebor, along with Bifur and Bombur.<ref name=""Meetings""/> It is possible that Bofur fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces the [[Easterlings]]. His death date is unknown though it would have been before [[Dwalin]] as he was the last dwarf of the company to pass away in {{foA|91}}.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], ""Durin's Folk""</ref>

The name ''Bǫvurr'' appears in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. Its meaning is unknown.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

Bombur's distinguishing characteristic was his size, for he was the fattest of the thirteen Dwarves.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref> After the death of Smaug, Bombur lived at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
===Family and birth===
Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother [[Bofur]] and his cousin [[Bifur]].<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref> Bombur was not of [[Durin]]'s line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref> His birth year is also unknown.

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was ""the eldest left"".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=""Durin"" /> this would put Bombur's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

Prior to the quest, Bombur probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with Thorin after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].{{fact}}

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Bombur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]]. When Bilbo jerked open his door the four fell on top of one another, with Thorin on the bottom and fat Bombur on top. Bombur wore a pale green hood and asked for pork-pie and salad for his refreshment. When Thorin later called for music, Bombur played a drum.<ref name=""Party"" />

When the company dealt with the [[trolls]], before the trolls could capture Bombur, he and Bifur fought like mad and were especially troublesome for the trolls to capture. Because of the resistance he and Bifur put up the trolls put him near their fire.<ref name=""Mutton"">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> Bombur expressed disappointment that Bilbo had tried to steal the troll's purse instead of heading straight back and telling the company what he'd found.

Running from the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] through their tunnels, Bombur carried Bilbo for part of the way, although he grumbled about it as he staggered with sweat dripping from his nose.<ref name=""Hill"" />

In the glade of the [[Wargs]] Bombur shared a pine tree with Bifur, Bofur, and Thorin.<ref name=""Pan"">{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up. Gandalf had told Bombur to arrive last and alone because he was the fattest, but the offended Dwarf had refused to wait.<ref name=""Queer"">{{H|Queer}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Bombur sleeping.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Lee]] - ''Bombur sleeping'']]
Bombur's most notable ""adventure"" occurred at the [[Enchanted River]]. Beorn had warned them about its water<ref name=""Queer"" /> and they did try to cross without touching it, but due to the charge of the deer, Bombur fell into the river. The company threw him a rope and he caught it, but upon landing he fell into an enchanted sleep. For six days the company took turns carrying the slumbering Dwarf. When finally awake he had forgotten everything since the quest began and lamented waking up to no food, since he couldn't eat anything while he was asleep for six days, and since the company had eaten the rest of the food the night before and saved none for him. Bombur felt weak and wobbly in the legs and sat down and wept. Bombur began to tell the rest of the dwarves about his beautiful dreams, but Thorin told him to be quiet and declared that everyone was annoyed with Bombur and that they should have abandoned him if he hadn't woken up when he did, and pronounced Bombur's dreams to be idiotic. When they were walking that day, Bombur kept on wailing that his legs wouldn't carry him. The others rebuffed him and refused to assist him. After a day of this, Bombur had had enough and refused to take another step. He flung himself to the ground and told them that that they could go on without him if they had to and that he was going to dream of food, if he couldn't get it any other way. He finished by exclaiming he hoped he never woke up again.

It was then that the first of the feasts of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] appeared north of the path. Bombur wanted to go to the lights, since his memory of the journey had been wiped clean and he didn't remember the warnings was for rushing to it but was restrained by the caution of the others, although Bilbo interceded for him. When they did attempt to enter the feasts everything vanished and eventually all of the Dwarves except Thorin were captured by the [[spiders]]. After the spiders had strung up the Dwarves, all of the dwarves were noted to be underfed, despite Bombur being the fattest of the bundles. Bombur was chosen to be killed first, but Bombur managed a weak kick which knocked the spider off the branch, which only briefly delayed the spider's attack and momentarily humiliated his tormentor. Due to this activity and everything else he had endured, Bombur was nearly exhausted; when freed he fell off his branch and luckily had his fall cushioned by leaves. He was noted to have been pinched and poked, and it could only have been the spiders or the impatient dwarves.<ref name=""Flies"" />

After the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] Bombur was found to be asleep or senseless.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

While the rest of the company climbed up to the ""doorstep"" on the side of the Lonely Mountain, Bombur and Bofur remained in the valley to tend to the ponies. While Bofur was willing to ascend by rope for changes of the guard, Bombur demurred, claiming that he was too fat for such sky-walks and he would either grow dizzy or the rope would break.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref> However, when Smaug came roaring out to scour the mountainside Bombur was hauled up the cliff, puffing and blowing.

When Thorin called for a siege and refused to negotiate, the other dwarves all seemed to share his mind except for Bombur, Fíli, and Kíli. Though Bombur later admitted to Bilbo that he was hesitant to defy Thorin to his face.<ref name=""H|Thief"">{{H|Thief}}</ref>

When Bilbo was going out to deliver the Arkenstone to elves and men, Bilbo passed him, invisible, sneaking out with the arkenstone, but stopped when he saw Bombur sitting on the edge of a cliff. Bombur lamented to Bilbo how cold it was, and Bilbo urged him to come inside where it was warmer. Bombur agreed, but grumbled that he couldn't come inside because he was out on watch duty until midnight. The two have a chat about how they both think Thorin is being unreasonable, Bombur felt it was a ""sorry business altogether"" and deemed Thorin ""ever a dwarf with a stiff neck"". Bilbo wishes to feel the grass beneath his toes, and Bombur longs for a soft bed, a strong drink, and a good supper, Bilbo offers to take Bombur's watch. Bombur did sleep and thanked Bilbo later when the Hobbit woke him up after midnight.<ref name=""H|Thief"" />

Bombur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
At [[Rivendell]] in December, {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bombur was still alive and living in Erebor. In fact, Bombur appeared to have used some of his wealth to increase his girth – he was unable to move alone from couch to table and required the aid of six young Dwarves to lift him.<ref name=""Meetings"" /> Given his age and immobility it is doubtful that Bombur fought in the [[Battle of Dale]].

==Etymology==
Bombur, or ''Bumburr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""the Swollen One"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the early manuscript fragments of ''The Hobbit'', Bombur produced a drum from ''nowhere'',<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 36</ref> whereas in the published text he just produced it ''from the hall''.<ref name=""Party"" /> [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') said that in the earliest phase Tolkien had added fairy tale touches of Dwarven magic to emphasize the uncanny, other-worldly nature of the Dwarves as opposed to Bilbo's ordinariness.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, (iii) ''Dwarven Magic'', p. 54</ref>

On the wet night before meeting the Trolls the pre-publication version had Bombur and Bofur failing to light a fire and quarrelling about it, with Dori and Nori getting into a fight.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref> In the published version Tolkien added a comment that [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]] were especially good at making a fire, made them the two who could not do it that night, and had them start fighting.<ref name=""Mutton"" />

Originally, when Bombur needed propping up in [[Mirkwood]] after being cut from the spiders' webbing, it was ''his cousins'' Bifur and Bofur who provided support.<ref>{{HH|Mirkwood}}, p. 313</ref> In the published story this was changed to Bombur's cousin Bifur and brother Bofur.<ref name=""Flies"" /> Also, in the earlier version, when [[Smaug]] first came out and the Dwarves in the valley had to be hauled up to the [[Back Door]], Bifur cried out to save Bombur and Bofur, who were both his ''brothers''.<ref>{{HH|Conversations}}</ref> In the published text Bifur cried out for his two ''cousins''.

In Tolkien's unfinished [[1960]] rewrite of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur, Bofur and Bombur were Thorin's attendants.<ref>{{HH|5}}, ""[[A Well-Planned Party]]"", p. 774</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] assumes this made them either courtiers or honor-guard.<ref>{{HH|5}}, ""[[Arrival in Rivendell]]"", note 32</ref> Although this relationship did not appear in the published story, it may be noted that Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur arrived at Bag End with Thorin<ref name=""Party"" /> and the same three Dwarves climbed the same pine tree with Thorin in the glade of the Wargs.<ref name=""Pan"" />

'''Borin''' ({{TA|2450}} – {{TA|2711|n}}, aged 261 years) was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's folk]].

==History==
Borin was the younger son of [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Náin II]]. During his youth, the [[House of Durin]] lived in the [[Dragons|dragon]]-plagued [[Grey Mountains]] that were ruled by his brother [[Dáin I]].

When the King and his son [[Frór]] were slain by a [[Cold-drake]], Durin's folk divided. Borin followed the new King [[Thrór]] back to [[Lonely Mountain]], while others followed [[Grór]] to the [[Iron Hills]]. Borin lived with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] under [[King under the Mountain|King]] Thrór for the rest of his life.

Through his son, [[Farin]], Borin was the ancestor of four of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company]] ([[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Óin]], and [[Glóin]]) and [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Borin'' might be derived from [[Old Norse]] ''bora'' (""to bore holes""), thus meaning ""Borer"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 224</ref>

'''Dori''' was a Dwarf who, being of [[Durin's Folk]], probably dwelt in the northern [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the latter had settled there after [[Thráin|Thráin II]] had disappeared.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to reclaim the lands from the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]], and after the successful conclusion of this quest he lived with his part of the treasure at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
=== Family and birth ===
Dori's parentage is unknown, although he was a member of the [[House of Durin]] and a remote kinsman of [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref name=""Durin""/> He was also the brother of [[Nori]], and a cousin of [[Ori]].<ref name=Person /> His birth year is also unknown.

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was ""the eldest left"".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=""Durin""/> this would put Dori's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

Thorin stated that Dori was the strongest of the Dwarves in the company.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>  Dori (and Nori) shared Bilbo's opinion that meals should be plentiful and frequent.,<ref name=""Mutton"">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> and also it is said that Dori was ""a decent fellow despite his grumbling"".

===The Quest of Erebor===
When Bilbo first met Dori (in the fourth group of Dwarves to arrive at [[Bag End]] alongside Nori and Ori and another set of brothers, [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]]) he was wearing a purple hood along with a silver belt, same as his brother Nori.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Dori (along with Nori and Ori) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

Bilbo proclaimed Dori to be ""really a decent fellow""<ref name=""Pan"">{{H|Pan}}</ref> because thrice Dori assisted Bilbo when the hobbit might otherwise have been killed:  First, Dori carried Bilbo in the tunnels of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the escape from the goblins, but unfortunately dropped him which led to the hobbit's encounter with Gollum.<ref name=""Hill""/> Upon Nori's discovery that Bilbo was gone the other Dwarves blamed Dori for losing their burglar, especially the wizard [[Gandalf]] arguing with the dwarf.  Second, during the escape from the [[Wargs]], Dori climbed down from a tree, which allowed Bilbo to scramble up Dori and into the tree.  Lastly, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as they were carried off by an eagle, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins, much to both Bilbo and Dori's dismay crying ""My legs! My poor legs!"".<ref name=""Pan""/>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Dori and Thorin were the first two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Thorin also notes that Dori is the strongest of their company. Upon being pulled out of the barrel after escaping the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s halls and arrived in [[Lake-town]], Dori, along with several others was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed only half alive.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> 

Dori would later fight in and survive the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], the new king under the mountain after Thorin's death at the battle by [[Bolg]], and made his home in Erebor alongside his other companions that survived the battle and would live in great wealth under King Dáin.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Dori lived a wealthy life after the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. His date of death is unknown but he was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]], as mentioned by [[Glóin]] before the [[Council of Elrond]] in {{TA|3018}}.<ref name=""Meetings""/> He probably fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces, the [[Easterlings]], along with the other members of the company still alive.

==Etymology==
''Dóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""Borer"" or ""auger-man"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Dwalin''' was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the [[House of Durin]]. Along with his brother, [[Balin]], Dwalin was a member of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] in the [[Quest of Erebor]], an attempt to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] from the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]]. Dwalin survived the adventure and the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]], and lived in wealth and splendour in the Lonely Mountain well into the [[Fourth Age]].

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Two years before Dwalin was born, in {{TA|2770}}, the dragon Smaug attacked the kingdom of Erebor,<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> and destroyed the settlement and the nearby city of [[Dale]], taking the gold of the mountain as his own. In the aftermath of destruction, King [[Thrór]] and a small group of his surviving kinsmen headed south while other [[Dwarves of Erebor]] escaped to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref> Because of this, Dwalin was born in exile, possibly in [[Dunland]] to [[Fundin]] in {{TA|2772}} nine years after his brother, Balin.

=== War of the Dwarves and Orcs ===
After years of living in Dunland, a despondent Thrór made a journey to Moria, where an orc cheiftan, [[Azog]], slaughtered him. In retaliation, [[Thráin II]], now King of Durin's Folk, waged war. A 27-year-old Dwalin participated in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], where, amid battle, Fundin and several other kinsman were slain. Despite this, the war was won. After the victory, Thráin was counselled by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] not to enter [[Moria|Khazad-Dûm]], so, Thráin and his son [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] settled in the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]].<ref name=""Line"">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref> At some point, Dwalin and Balin joined Thráin in the Blue Mountains, along with the other survivors of the war.

=== King Thráin's expedition ===
In {{TA|2841}}, Dwalin, Balin and a few other dwarves accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to reclaim his lost homeland, Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of the dark lord, [[Sauron]], because Thráin carried one of the seven dwarven rings of power. In {{TA|2845}}, Thráin and the rest of the company were separated by a black rain in the eaves of the dark forest, [[Mirkwood]]. Unbeknonwst to Dwalin and the company, Thráin had been captured by Sauron. After a fruitless search for their leader the Dwarves gave up and returned to inform Thorin of the mision's failure, who became the new King of Durin's Folk.<ref name=""Durin""/>

=== Quest for Erebor ===
[[File:Adlpictures - Dwalin.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''Dwalin'' by Adlpictures]]
A century later, in {{TA|2941}}, Dwalin and Balin joined Thorin's expedition to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Per the instructions of the wizard, [[Gandalf]], they were invited to a [[smial]] named [[Bag End]], which is located in the [[the Shire]], to form their plan. Dwalin was the first dwarf to arrive, alone, when the unexpected party began at the hobbit, which was owned by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was wearing a dark-green hood and walked in as if expected and hung his hood on one of Bilbo's pegs. A greatly surprised hobbit invited Dwalin to tea. Soon, Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first dwarves to lend a hand. Later still, when Thorin called for music, Dwalin and Balin said that they forgot their instruments on the porch and are sent by Thorin to bring his instrument as well. When they returned; Dwalin and Balin brought viols as large as themselves and Thorin's harp.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref> 

The next day, the company met at the [[Green Dragon]] Inn. When Bilbo told the company that he had forgotten to bring his hat or his pocket-handkerchief, Dwalin gave him his spare dark-green hood and cloak to keep in place of a hat, but told him that he would ""''have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things before the journey's end''"". Soon afterward, Gandalf arrived and brought several of Bilbo's assortments. 

In [[Eriador]], at the [[Trollshaws]], Dwalin along with the entire company were captured by [[Trolls]] after Bilbo went to explore a fire. The three trolls: [[William]], [[Bert]] and [[Tom]] soon began to argue among themselves, and Gandalf managed to save them. Shortly afterward, the company located and looted the nearby troll cave.

Later on, the company arrived at [[Rivendell]] and stayed with the [[half-elven]] lord [[Elrond]] for about 14 days with food and something for everyone. On one night Elrond disclosed the swords Thorin and Gandalf found in the troll-hoard as [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. Elrond also read the moon letters of the map of Thror, which read: ''""Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the key-hole.''""

After seeking refuge from a storm in a cave which was, unbeknownst to them the [[Front Porch]] of [[Goblin-town]], they were captured by [[Goblins]]. They were saved by Gandalf, and Bilbo, fleeing after his encounter with [[Gollum]], also escaped. The company were then chased by [[Wargs]] and they rushed into the trees. Dwalin and Balin managed to swarm up a tall slender fir that had few branches for sitting, and they were later then saved by the [[Eagles]] of the [[Great Eagle]].<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  The next day, when the company arrived at [[Beorn]]'s hall after the eagles left them on the [[Carrock]], Dwalin and Balin were the third pair of Dwarves to appear during Gandalf's story, trying to intrigue the skin-changer. They were later served well in dinner and breakfast and were also given ponies to ride until they arrived at the forest of Mirkwood, the same place where Thráin was lost nearly 100 years before.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

At the [[Enchanted River]] in Mirkwood, Dwalin was in the last boatload to cross with [[Bombur]].  He exited the boat just before a deer charged down the path and caused Bombur to fall in the water, which put him in an enchanted sleep for six days, and when he woke up, he had forgotten the whole journey.  Later, after the Dwarves had been captured by the [[spiders]] and rescued by Bilbo, it was Dwalin who first realised that Thorin was missing,<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref> for at that point, though unknown to the Dwarves, Thorin had been captured by the Wood-Elves. 

At the opening of the barrels after the escape from the halls of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy Dwarves and did nothing to help pull out other Dwarves as they arrived in [[Lake-town]], where they were greeted extremely fondly.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> Afterwards, though the [[Master of Lake-town]] didn't believe that Thorin was truly the [[King under the Mountain]], they left for the mountain. When the last week of autumn arrived it was Dwalin who complained the most about Bilbo's inactivity.  He felt that Bilbo, with his ""invisible ring"", ought to go through the [[Front Gate]] of Erebor and spy things out.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

After [[Smaug]] went to destroy Lake-town, the dwarves entered and Thorin's search for the [[Arkenstone]] began. Dwalin later fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]] along with several others from the company (all but Thorin and Fíli and Kíli).  Afterwards he received his fourteenth share and chose to live in Erebor under the rule of Thorin's cousin and new king after his death, [[Dáin II]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

=== Later life ===
Dwalin lived in great wealth in Erebor after the Battle of the Five Armies. In {{TA|2989}}, his brother Balin set out on a quest to reclaim [[Moria]] though Dáin was against it. He set out with others (such as [[Óin]] and [[Ori]]). For about 5 years messages came from Moria and it seemed good, until suddenly news stopped (though unknown to him, the colony was destroyed by [[Orcs]]).

As Bilbo packed some oddments in {{TA|3001}} before departing the Shire, Bilbo brought Dwalin's green hood he had given him, though the colour had worn out. Dwalin was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were still living in Erebor when [[Frodo Baggins]] came to [[Rivendell]], as reported by [[Glóin]] before the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> It is possible that he fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against Sauron's forces, the [[Easterlings]], under King Dáin (though the king was slain). Dwalin lived until {{FoA|91}}, passing at the age of 340,<ref name=""Line""/>

== Etymology ==
In [[Norse mythology]], ''Dvalinn'' is a chief Dwarf.<ref>Snorri Sturlusson, ''Prose Edda'', ""[[wikipedia:Skaldskaparmal|Skaldskaparmal]]""</ref> The origin of the name is uncertain; suggested etymologies are ""one lying in a trance"",<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', p. 32</ref> ""numb"" and ""dawdler"".<ref>Henry A. Bellows (ed.), ''Völuspá'', ""[http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm Poetic Edda]""</ref> Both words, ''dvalen'' (""to sleep"") ''dvelja'' (""to delay"") derive from the same root.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the early version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', it was Dwalin rather than Balin who spotted the Trolls' fire in the woods (and it was stated that Dwalin was always the Dwarves' look-out).<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref> This contradicted the fact that Balin was the Dwarf who was looking for Bilbo at the inn at the start of the adventure<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref> and Tolkien eventually made Balin the permanent look-out. However, Dwalin remained the first Dwarf to arrive at Bag End<ref name=""Party""/> (what would be expected of the Company's look-out). Dwalin was also the first to notice that Thorin was missing after the battle with the spiders,<ref name=""Flies""/> a testament to his observational abilities.

The '''Dwarves of Khazad-dûm''' were the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]] who mined and worked mithril for long ages in the halls of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], and who had the friendship of the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]] during the [[Second Age]].

==History==
===First Age===
Khazad-dûm was the oldest and most famous of the Kingdoms of the Dwarves. It was the home of [[Durin I]], the first of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]]. He began to work on the mansions after finding caves in the [[Misty Mountains]]. Thus became King Durin I of Khazad-dûm and ruled Durin's Folk for many years, causing him to be named ""Durin the Deathless"" until he died during the [[First Age]]. Afterwards, other rulers of Khazad-dûm were sometimes named Durin, as they were considered to be his reincarnations, who the dwarves believed came to live again among his people.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

The Dwarves of Khazad-dûm also [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|colonized]] the [[Iron Hills]], which became Durin's Folk's primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref>

The Dwarves also built a stone-bridge over the [[Anduin]] and the first miles of the [[Old Forest Road]] into the [[Greenwood]].<ref name=NM>{{NM|P3xx}}</ref>

===Second Age===
In the second age, the Dwarves were joined by the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]], fleeing the ruin of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]]. Their numbers were enriched by them, as well as their craft and skill.

Around that time, Khazad-dûm was in a confederation with [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]], where the Men provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items. This cooperation continued until the reign of [[Durin IV]].<ref name=""Dwarves"">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  

Also fleeing the destruction, the [[Noldor]] founded a country of their own by the western gate of Khazad-dûm, [[Eregion]]. A rare friendship sprang up between the Dwarves and the Elves of this new land. By that time, Khazad-dûm had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the [[Walls of Moria]].<ref name=Journey>{{FR|II4}}</ref> [[Narvi]] with Eregion's ruler, [[Celebrimbor]], constructed the magical [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], and indeed Celebrimbor went so far as to present King [[Durin III]] with an Elven [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]].<ref name=""Durin""/> 

The friendship of Khazad-dûm and Eregion came to a sudden end, however, in {{SA|1697}}. [[Sauron]] [[Sack of Eregion|overran]] the country of the Elves, and despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to help them, he succeeded in destroying Eregion and driving away  the survivors. Durin sent a great force of Dwarves to protect the Doors of Durin, but with the Elves dead or fleeing far away his warriors withdrew and the gates to the city were shut against Sauron, also secluding the kingdom off from the outside world<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> and communication with their [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|kinsmen]] in the [[Iron Hills]] was cut off.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref> 

Their seclusion was broken for a time with the beginning of the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. The Dwarves of Moria fought alongside the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] in their campaign to defeat Sauron for the last time.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> With the conclusion of the War the Dwarves went back to their city.

===Third Age===
The Dwarves of Moria remained secured and safe since the [[Dark Years]], until their numbers dwindled and many of its mansions emptied.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Most of the Dwarves's great wealth was based on the ''[[Mithril]]'' that was found in the mines of Moria, and as the centuries passed, they mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year {{TA|1980}}, they dug too deep, and unleashed a nameless terror from the depths beneath the city. The creature wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the King, [[Durin VI]], became known as [[Durin's Bane]]. In the following year, Durin's son, [[Náin I]], was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home. 

The Dwarven people separated and joined [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|their folk]] at the [[Grey Mountains]] although others followed the King to [[Erebor]] to found [[Kingdom under the Mountain|another Kingdom]].

Descendants of the Dwarves of Moria, [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]] and [[Bombur]],<ref name=""Durin""/> and some members of the [[House of Durin]], [[Thorin and Company|joined]] King in exile [[Thorin II Oakenshield]] to reclaim Erebor in {{TA|2941}}.

'''Dís''' (born [[Third Age]] {{TA|2760|n}}) was a [[Dwarf-women|female]] [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the royal line of [[Durin's folk]].

==History==
Dís was the daughter of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and younger sister of [[Thorin]] and [[Frerin]]. Like her brothers, she was born in [[Lonely Mountain]] and was driven into exile in {{TA|2770}} when the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] sacked the kingdom. She was the mother of [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]]. 

Although female Dwarves were rarely seen by outsiders, or mentioned in Dwarven records, Dís was an exceptional case: her sons were killed heroically defending their mortally wounded uncle Thorin in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Dís'' is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''-dís'' (""sister"") found in many Nordic names (such as ''Herdís'', ''Hjördís'', etc).<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>

'''Flói''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

==History==
Flói was a member of [[Balin's folk]] who tried to reclaim [[Moria]] in {{TA|2989}}.  When they reached the [[Mirrormere]], there was a great battle. Flói was valorous and killed the great chieftain, but was killed by a [[Goblin]] arrow.<ref>[[Book of Mazarbul]] records ""Flói was killed by an arrow. He slew the great [...] Flói under grass near Mirror mere""; {{FR|Bridge}}</ref>  

Although against the Dwarven traditions,<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> he was buried under the grass near the Mirrormere. His death was recorded in the [[Book of Mazarbul]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name ''Flói'' could be connected with the Old Norse verb ''flóa'' (""to boil"", ""to flood"") and that the Old Norse word ''Flói'' means ""marshy moor"", ""bay"" or ""large firth"".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 224</ref>

'''Frerin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2751|n}} – {{TA|2799|n}}, aged 48 years) was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of the royal line of [[Durin's folk]], and the second son of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]]. His older brother was the Dwarven hero and future king [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]], and his younger sister was [[Dís]]. 

==History==
With the rest of his family, Frerin was driven into exile from the [[Lonely Mountain]] when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|attacked]] their home. He later took part in the bloody [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], although he was still very young at the time. 

In the final conflict of the war, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], Frerin was in the first assault of the vanguard that was led by his father, which was thrown back with loss. Frerin and the rest of the vanguard were driven into a wood of great trees near the lake [[Mirrormere]]. It was there Frerin was slain, along with his kinsman [[Fundin]], and many others.

After the battle, the Dwarves that were left built pyres, and [[Burned Dwarves|burned]] the bodies of their dead, Frerin being among them.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Frerin'' may derive from either the [[Old Norse]] Dwarf-name ''Frár'' (""Swift"") in the ''[[Völuspá]]'', or from Old Norse ''frérinn'' (""frozen"").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 225</ref>

'''Frár''' was a [[Dwarves of Erebor|dwarf of Erebor]].

== History ==
Frár was part of [[Balin's Colony]] to reclaim [[Moria]]. Their mission at first seemed successful, and [[Balin]] went so far as to claim the title [[Lord of Moria]]. This all changed in their fifth year there. On November 10, the [[Orcs]] came up the [[Silverlode]] and killed Balin while he was alone, and unaware and looking into [[Mirrormere]]. The Dwarves fought back but  eventually lost [[East-gate]] and [[First Hall]]. 
The Orcs made it across the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] and there was a [[Battle of the Second Hall|battle in the Second Hall]], and Frár and his companions [[Lóni]] and [[Náli]] died bravely while the rest of the colonists retreated.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Frár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means ""swift"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

Fundin was most likely born in the [[Lonely Mountain]] and went into exile with his people after the attack by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]. He fathered two sons, [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]].

Fundin was killed beneath the [[East-gate of Moria]] in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the final conflict of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]: He was part of the first assault of the vanguard that was thrown back with loss, and was driven into a wood by lake [[Mirrormere]]. 

He was slain there along with his kinsman [[Frerin]], and many others. After the battle his body was burned on a wooden pyre along with the rest of the [[Burned Dwarves|dead]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Years later, his sons, as members of [[Thorin and Company]], were involved with the [[Quest of Erebor|regaining of Lonely Mountain]]. [[Roäc]] recognised Balin as the son of Fundin.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

'''Fíli''' ({{TA|2859}} – {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name=""Line"">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref> 82 years old) was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] who took part in the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], which was [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s great adventure. He was one of the three Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who did not survive the [[Battle of Five Armies]] (the other two being his uncle [[Thorin]] and his brother [[Kíli]].)

== History ==
Fíli and Kíli were the sons of [[Dís]], the sister of [[Thorin]].  Before the quest to Erebor, they probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] where their uncle resided after the disappearance of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name=""Line""/>  As Thorin's sister-sons, they accompanied their uncle when he set out to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  Before the Dwarves met Bilbo, [[Gandalf]] met with them and persuaded them to bring the hobbit on the quest.  At this meeting Fíli thought that Bilbo sounded like a strange creature and laughed at his name.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}, ''Extracts from the earlier version''</ref>

=== The Quest of Erebor ===
When Bilbo first met Fíli and Kíli (in the third group of Dwarves to arrive at [[Bag End]]) they were wearing blue hoods.  After supper,  Fíli and Kíli played small fiddles that they had brought in bags.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

The brothers were the youngest of the company by some 50 years,<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> with Kíli being five years younger than his brother.<ref name=""Line""/>   Although not twins, the two brothers were inseparable throughout the adventure.

[[File:Adlpictures - Fili.jpg|200px|thumb|Adlpictures - ''Fíli'']]Early on the night when the company encountered the [[Trolls]] one of the ponies became frightened and bolted into the river; Fíli and Kíli nearly drowned getting the beast out of the water.  After the trolls had turned to stone and the company explored their hideout, it was Fíli who encouraged the others to get out of the ""horrible smell"" in the troll's lair.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

Up in the [[Misty Mountains]] during the thunder-battle the two brothers, being the youngest Dwarves with the keenest eyes, were sent ahead to look for shelter.  They found a small dry cave which was perfect for the company (until the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] arrived).  After [[Gandalf]] had rescued the company and was counting the members he found Fíli and Kíli, as usual, paired together.<ref name=""Hill""/>

When the company rushed up into trees to escape the [[wargs]], Fíli and Kíli scrambled to the top of a tall larch.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  The next day, when the company arrived at [[Beorn]]'s [[Beorn's Hall|Hall]], Fíli and Kíli were again together as the fourth pair of Dwarves to appear during Gandalf's story.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

When Bilbo spied the boat on the far side of the [[Enchanted River]], Thorin chose Fíli as the youngest<ref group=""note"">In ''[[The Hobbit]]'' Thorin called Fíli the youngest, but in [[Appendix A]] Fíli's date of birth was given as {{TA|2859}} while Kíli's date of birth was given as {{TA|2864|n}}.  Perhaps Thorin had trouble remembering the ages of these two ""very young"" Dwarves (both of whom were under age 85 at the time of the quest).</ref> with the best sight (instead of [[Dori]], the strongest) to throw a rope with a hook attached to snag the small vessel.  Fíli did manage to snag the boat on the second try but could not pull it across.  Kíli came to his aid first, followed by [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], before the boat came loose (after its painter snapped).   When the company made the crossing they used another rope that Fíli threw ahead into the trees since the boat had no oars.<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

After the Dwarves had been captured by [[spiders]] Bilbo climbed out on the branch where the spiders had trussed up the Dwarves.  The first bundle that Bilbo reached was Fíli, whom the hobbit recognized by the tips of his blue hood and long nose poking out of the threads.<ref group=""note"">The fact that Bilbo recognized Fíli by his long nose (as opposed to Kíli) shows that the two brothers were not identical in appearance.</ref>  Once freed, Fíli helped Bilbo free the other Dwarves despite being sickened by spider-poison.<ref name=""Flies""/>

After the escape from the halls of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], Fíli and Kíli came out smiling since they were young and had but few bruises.  The two brothers helped Thorin and Bilbo locate and free the other Dwarves.  Next, they accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to the bridge into [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] while the others recovered and  Fíli was the most impatient to see the [[Master of Lake-town]] at his feast.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

When the company reached the Lonely Mountain, Thorin sent out a scouting party to view the Front Gate (or where it once stood).  Fíli and Kíli went along with [[Balin]] and Bilbo on this expedition.  On another scouting trip Bilbo was with Fíli and Kíli when the three discovered the rough steps that led up the mountain to the little bay that contained the secret door.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

Of the thirteen Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli looked uncomfortable when Bilbo asked for volunteers to accompany him on the first trip into the mountain (only Balin went with the hobbit for part of the way).  Once the dragon woke up though Fíli and Kíli, along with Bilbo and Balin, were the first to go in the tunnel (sent in by Thorin).<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>

While searching the treasure when the full company descended into Erebor, Fíli and Kíli were in such exuberant spirits that they took down magic golden harps and played music on them.<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>

Fíli was slain with his brother in the [[Battle of Five Armies]], while defending their mortally wounded uncle.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>  After Thorin's death, the brothers would have been the only remaining descendants of [[Thrór]]'s line and Fíli would have inherited the title of [[King under the Mountain]].  Their deaths ended the dynasty, and the title passed to [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II]].  It was their heroic last stand that made their mother the only [[Dwarf-women|Dwarf-woman]] to be mentioned in the genealogies.<ref name=""Line""/>

==Etymology==
''Fíli'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It can mean ""File"" or ""Filer""; it is of Frisian or Low German origin rather than Old Norse.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Gamil Zirak''', also called '''Zirak'''<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}, pp. 319, 322</ref> or the '''Old''', was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] smith and the master of [[Telchar]] of [[Nogrod]].<ref name="":0"">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ""Index; *Gamil Zirak""</ref>

== History ==
Gamil Zirak was a Dwarf smith, master of Telchar of Nogrod, maker of many renowned works. Gamil Zirak was a great craftsman himself, and the treasuries of [[Thingol]] were known to hold examples of his work.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref>

Even though it isn't explicitly stated in the text, the fact that Gamil Zirak was the master of Telchar of Nogrod makes it probable that he also lived in that city.

Whether he lived in Nogrod or its neighboring city [[Belegost]], it's probable that Gamil Zirak was one of the [[Firebeards]] or [[Broadbeams]], the two dwarven houses that settled in the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Part Two: Late Writings, X. ""[[Of Dwarves and Men]]""</ref> It's also probable that, besides [[Khuzdul]], he spoke [[Sindarin]], for that was the custom among the Dwarves.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Quenta Silmarillion]]"", 10. ""[[Of the Sindar]]""</ref>

== Etymology ==
''[[Gamil]]'' is probably a [[Khuzdul]] word, of unknown meaning. Some people find worthy of noting its striking similarity to [[Old Norse]] ''gamall'' (""old""),<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2003.02.0002:entry=gamall “gamall”], in Geir T. Zoëga, ''A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press</ref> which quite possibly was the inspiration for the former, since Gamil Zirak was also called ""the Old"", for it woudn't be the first time a Dwarvish name was taken from Old Norse.<ref group=""note"">For more, see: [[North Germanic languages]]</ref>

''[[Zirak]]'' is a Khuzdul word meaning ""tine""<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 35-6</ref> or ""spike"".<ref>{{TI|VIII}}, pp. 174-5 (note 22)</ref>

'''Gróin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2671|n}} - {{TA|2923|n}}, 252 years old) was a Dwarf of the [[Longbeards]].

==History==
Gróin was an important figure in the royal genealogies of the [[Dwarves]], Gróin was the grandson of [[Borin]], the younger son of King [[Náin II]], and so could claim direct descent from [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] himself. In his turn, Gróin was the younger brother of [[Fundin]], father to [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], and uncle to [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]], all four of whom travelled on the [[Quest of Erebor]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Through his son Glóin, he was also grandfather to [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]]. For all his genealogical importance, though, we know almost nothing of his life. His dates of birth and death, though, show us that he was alive at the time of [[Smaug]]'s [[Sack of Erebor]], and the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] twenty-nine years later. It is likely that he was present at both these events.

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Gróin'' (like ''[[Grór#Etymology|Grór]]'') is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''gróa'' (""to grow""), thus meaning ""Growing-one"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>

'''Grór''' was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and a significant leader among the [[Durin's Folk|people of Durin]].

==Life==
===Birth and early Life===
He was born into the [[House of Durin]] in {{TA|2563}} during its last years in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He was the youngest of the three sons of King [[Dáin I]], who ruled [[Durin's folk]].<ref name=""Line"">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref>

When Grór was seven years old, in {{TA|2570|n}} dragons began [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|afflicting the dwarves in the north]]. Nineteen years later, in {{TA|2589|n}} his father King [[Dáin I]] was slain by a [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] outside [[Dáin's Halls|his hall]] in the Grey Mountains.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2589, p. 1087</ref> A short time afterwards most of Durin's Folk left the Grey Mountains.<ref name=""Grór"">{{App|Durin}}, entry for Grór, p. 1072</ref> In {{TA|2590|n}}<ref name=""TA2590"">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2590, p. 1087</ref> Grór left the Grey Mountains with many followers and established a colony in the Iron Hills<ref name=""Grór"" /> becoming the Lord of the Iron Hills. In the same year,<ref name=""TA2590"" /> his brother [[Thrór]], the oldest son<ref name=""Line"" /> and heir of Dáin, and the rest of the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains moved back to the Lonely Mountain<ref name=""Thrór"">{{App|Durin}}, entry for Thrór, p. 1072</ref>.

===Lord of the Iron Hills, and later life===
Over the next few centuries a large quantity of ore was traded between the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills,<ref name=""Thrór"" /> until the Dragon [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|destroyed]] the Kingdom under the Mountain and scattered the Longbeards who dwelt there<ref name=""Thrór"" /> in {{TA|2770|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2770, p. 1088</ref>. Most of the survivors subsequently went to their kinsmen in the Iron Hills.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, entry for Thrór, footnote after ""They went away south with their family."", p. 1072</ref>

In {{TA|2799|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2799, p. 1088</ref> the final battle of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] [[Battle of Azanulbizar|occurred in the Dimrill Dale]]. Grór's son [[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]], accompanied by his son [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]] led reinforcements from the Iron Hills to the battle, but was killed by the master of the [[Orcs]] of [[Moria]], [[Azog]], before the [[Great Gates|East Gate]] of Moria. The then still quite young Dáin killed Azog and the dwarves won the battle. With the war over, Dáin led his people home to the Iron Hills.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, entry for Dáin II Ironfoot, p. 1075</ref>

Six years later, in {{TA|2805}}, Grór died at 241 years of age and his grandson Dáin became Lord of the Iron Hills.

Many years later, in {{TA|2941|n}} when Thrór's last descendant, [[Thorin]], was killed in the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Dáin II Ironfoot became the new [[King under the Mountain]] and [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of the Longbeards]],<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1078</ref> a title that remained with the descendants of Grór<ref name=""Line"" />.

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Grór'' (like ''[[Gróin#Etymology|Gróin]]'') is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''gróa'' (""to grow""), thus meaning ""Growing-one"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>

'''Hannar''' was one of the four Dwarves that stayed at [[Bag End]] after [[Bilbo Baggins]]' birthday party.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>

== History ==
In the early writings of the chapter ""[[A Long-expected Party]]"", Hannar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.{{fact}}

== Etymology ==
''Hanarr'' and ''Hannarr'' are dwarfs from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. Both their names mean ""Skilled"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Ibun''' was the son of [[Mîm]] and brother of [[Khîm]], the last of the [[Petty-dwarves]].<ref name=""Mim"">{{CH|7}}, p. 132</ref>

==History==
Ibun lived with his family at [[Amon Rûdh]]. They were seen by the [[Gaurwaith]] as they snuck past them carrying heavy sacks. Mîm was captured, and the two brothers fled into the mist. As they ran, Khîm was shot by a wild arrow from the outlaws, but Ibun survived, and shared his father's [[House of Ransom]] with [[Túrin]] and the outlaws.<ref name=""Mim""/>

One winter, the two [[Petty-dwarves]] went out in search of roots, and were captured by a band of [[Orcs]]. To save his life Mîm betrayed Túrin to the [[Orcs]], but Ibun's fate is unclear.<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 148</ref>  

Much later, in [[Nargothrond]], Mîm told [[Húrin]], ""I am the last of my people"",<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> meaning that he outlived both his sons; Ibun either lost his life at the hands of the Orcs, or in some later unrecorded mishap.

==History==
One day, when out travelling with his father and brother, the three were set upon by [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]'s [[Gaurwaith|outlaw band]]. With Ibun, Khîm fled into the mist, but a stray arrow fired by one of the outlaws struck him as he fled. Though he escaped back to Mîm's halls beneath [[Amon Rûdh]]—no doubt with his brother's help—his wound was mortal, and he died before his father returned.<ref name=""Mim""/>

Túrin and his companions came to dwell in Mîm's house, which became known as the [[House of Ransom]], in part because of Khîm's premature death. The archer who shot him, an outlaw named [[Andróg]], was cursed by Mîm, and forced to break his bow.<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 132</ref>

'''Kíli''' ({{TA|2864}} – {{TA|2941|n}}<ref name=""Line"">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref> 77 years old) was the son of [[Dís]], the sister of King [[Thorin]], and brother of [[Fíli]].  

Kíli was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] who took part in the quest for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], which was [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s great adventure. The brothers were the youngest of [[Thorin and Company]] by some 50 years,<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> with Kíli being five years younger than his brother.<ref name=""Line""/> The two brothers were inseparable throughout the adventure. 

The brothers, along with Thorin himself, did not survive the [[Battle of Five Armies]].

==History==
Before the quest to Erebor, Fíli and Kíli probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] where their uncle resided after the disappearance of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name=""Line""/> As Thorin's sister-sons, they accompanied their uncle when he set out to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].

===The Quest of Erebor===

When Bilbo first met Kíli and Fíli (in the third group of Dwarves to arrive at [[Bag End]]) they wore blue hoods.  After supper, when the Dwarves made music, Kíli and Fíli played small fiddles that they had brought in bags.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

Early on the night when the company encountered the [[trolls]] one of the ponies became frightened and bolted into the river; Kíli and Fíli nearly drowned getting the beast out of the water.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

Up in the [[Misty Mountains]] during the thunder-battle the two brothers, being the youngest Dwarves with the keenest eyes, were sent ahead to look for shelter.  They found a small dry cave which was perfect for the company (until the [[Orcs|Goblins]] arrived).  After [[Gandalf]] had rescued the company and was counting the members he found Kíli and Fíli, as usual, paired together.<ref name=""Hill""/>

When the company rushed up into trees to escape the [[wargs]] Kíli and Fíli scrambled to the top of a tall larch.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  The next day, when the company arrived at [[Beorn]]'s hall, Kíli and Fíli were again together as the fourth pair of Dwarves to appear during Gandalf's story.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

When Bilbo spied the boat on the far side of the [[Enchanted River]], Fíli managed to snag it with a hook on a rope but could not pull it across.  Kíli came to his aid first, followed by [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], before the boat came loose (after its painter snapped).<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

At the opening of the barrels after the escape from the halls of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], Kíli and Fíli came out smiling since they were young and had but few bruises.  The two brothers helped Thorin and Bilbo locate and free the other Dwarves.  Next, they accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to the bridge into [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] while the others recovered.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>
[[Image:Angelo Montanini - Kili.jpg|thumb|right|Angelo Montanini - ''Kili'']]
When the company reached the Lonely Mountain, Thorin sent out a scouting party to view the Front Gate (or where it had once stood).  Kíli and Fíli went along with [[Balin]] and Bilbo on this expedition.  On another scouting trip Bilbo was with Kíli and Fíli when the three discovered the rough steps that led up the mountain to the little bay that contained the secret door.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

Of the thirteen Dwarves, Kíli and Fíli looked uncomfortable when Bilbo asked for volunteers to accompany him on the first trip into the mountain (only Balin went with the hobbit for part of the way).  Once the dragon woke up though Kíli and Fíli, along with Bilbo and Balin, were the first to go in the tunnel (sent in by Thorin).<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>

While searching the treasure when the full company descended into Erebor, Kíli and Fíli were in such exuberant spirits that they took down magic golden harps and played music on them.<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>

Kíli was slain with his brother in the [[Battle of Five Armies]], while defending their mortally wounded uncle.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>  After Thorin's death, the brothers would have been the only remaining descendants of [[Thrór]]'s line.  Their deaths ended the dynasty, and the title of King under the Mountain passed to [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II]].  It was their heroic last stand that made their mother the only [[Dwarf-women|Dwarf-woman]] to be mentioned in the genealogies.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Kíli'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It can mean ""Wedge"" or ""One who uses a wedge""; it is of Frisian or Low German origin rather than Old Norse.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

:Because [[Ori]] was made the youngest of the 13 Dwarves in the ''Hobbit'' films, Kíli is presumably the second youngest. He also comes to have an infatuation with [[Elves of Mirkwood|Mirkwood Elf]] [[Tauriel]] (a character made up exclusively for the films). When struck with a poisoned arrow by [[Bolg]] during the Company's escape from the Wood-elves' custody via wine barrels, it is she who ultimately heals him with [[Athelas]]. Due to said injury, Thorin did not allow him to journey with the others up to the Lonely Mounatin from [[Lake-town]]. [[Óin]] and Fíli then both opted to also stay behind in order to look after him. As he and the other Dwarves make their way to the [[Lonely Mountain]] after [[Smaug]]'s demise, Kíli shares a tender moment with Tauriel, and gives her the talisman that his mother had given to him. In the [[Battle of Five Armies]], he assists [[Thorin]] (along with [[Fíli]] and [[Dwalin]]) in attempting to kill the [[Orcs|Orc]] army leader [[Azog]] on [[Ravenhill]]. However, after witnessing Azog kill his brother, he goes into a rage, attempting to charge the Pale Orc, only to instead come across Tauriel getting severely beaten by Bolg, and proceeds to attack him. Kíli is stabbed to death by Bolg, and a heartbroken Tauriel returns the talisman to his lifeless hand. Tauriel stayed there, mourning over his death before Thranduil came upon the pair. It was then that Tauriel declared her love for the Dwarf, before leaving his side.

'''Ori''' was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Ori lived at the Lonely Mountain<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|II1}}</ref> until he went to [[Moria]] as part of [[Balin|Balin's]] ill-fated [[Balin's folk|attempt]] to re-take the ancient mansions of the Dwarves.<ref name=""Bridge"">{{FR|II5}}</ref>

==History==
=== Family and birth ===
Ori's parentage is unknown, although he was a remote kinsman of Thorin and a member of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name=""Durin""/>  His birth year is also unknown. 

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen ""by some fifty years"",<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was ""the eldest left"".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=""Durin""/> this would put Ori's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

Ori was a member of the [[House of Durin]] and probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after he began living there following the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}},<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> Ori was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  He wore a grey hood.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Ori (along with [[Dori]] and [[Nori]]) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Ori and Nori were the second pair of Dwarves to arrive.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

[[File:Joona Kujanen - Last Moments.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Joona Kujanen - ''Last Moments'']]Ori fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria===
In {{TA|2989}}<ref name=""TA""/> Ori (and Óin) had followed Balin with a [[Balin's folk|company]] of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient mansions of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which were already occupied by the [[Orcs|Goblins]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> At first the colony did well, but [[Third Age 2994|less than five years later]] Balin was killed, the Orcs returned and took the [[Great Gates|East-gate]], and Óin's group that he took west to the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] was destroyed except for a few.

[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mazarbul page 2.jpg|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Mazarbul]] written by Ori in [[Tengwar]].]]

Ori retreated to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] where [[Balin's Tomb|Balin's tomb]] was laid. He wrote the last pages in the [[Book of Mazarbul]] before he and the last few remaining Dwarves perished during a [[Last stand of Balin's folk|final stand]].<ref name=""Bridge""/> As Ori knew there was no hope to escape, he continued writing in the book, hoping that someone would find it, and would know what happened to them.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #10</ref>

When [[Frodo Baggins]] came to [[Rivendell]] he met [[Glóin]], who delighted in telling the hobbit about the doings of the renewed dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain. But when Frodo asked about Ori, [[Balin]], and [[Óin]] (also members of Thorin and Company), Glóin's face darkened and he said that he did not know. In fact, their fate was largely why the Dwarves had come to Rivendell at that time, to seek advice.<ref name=""Meetings""/>

===Legacy===
During the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] journeyed through [[Moria]] and discovered the book that contained the records of the expedition. The last lines were written by Ori, as recognized by [[Gimli]] due to Ori's recognizable large, bold handwriting using [[Tengwar]] (Gimli also said that Ori could write well and speedily).<ref name=""Bridge""/>

==Etymology==
Óri is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means ""Violent"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''Telchar''' was a [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarf]] of [[Nogrod]] in the [[Blue Mountains]], and one of the greatest smiths in the history of [[Middle-earth]]. 

== History ==
Telchar was trained by [[Gamil Zirak]], another great smith.<ref name=""Narn"">{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref> Among his works were [[Angrist]] (the knife that freed the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]]),<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> [[Narsil]] (the sword of [[Elendil]], later reforged for [[Aragorn]] as [[Andúril]]),<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref> and the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]].<ref name=""Narn""/>

==Etymology==
It is not defined whether the name Telchar is [[Sindarin]] or [[Khuzdul]]. The formation seems to suggest to be Sindarin since the digraph ''ch'' is not used in Khuzdul.<ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] notes a resemblance to the ''[[Wikipedia:Telchines|Telchines]]'' of Greek mythology, a mythological race of divine craftsmen.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, p. 89</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Telchar appears for the first time in the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', simply named as the creator of the dragon-helm.<ref>{{LB|1b}}, p. 115, v. 678. Cf. p. 126</ref> In the later ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', Telchar is said to be from [[Belegost]], instead of Nogrod as in the ''[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn]]''.<ref>{{SM|Q11}}, p. 118. Cf. p. 182</ref>

'''Thrór''' ({{TA|2542}} – {{TA|2790|n}}, lived 248 years) was King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 201 years, from {{TA|2589|n}} to 2790. He was the eldest son of [[Dáin I]] and brother of [[Grór]] and [[Frór]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
After a great [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]] killed both his father and brother [[Frór]], the remaining brothers Thrór  and [[Grór]] led their people away from the [[Grey Mountains]].  As Dáin's heir Thrór led many [[Dwarves]] back to [[Lonely Mountain]] in {{TA|2590}},<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> where he became [[King under the Mountain]], a title held earlier by his ancestor, [[Thorin I]].  Grór continued east with a great following of Durin's folk to the [[Iron Hills]], where he founded his own [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|realm]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

=== King under the Mountain ===
At Erebor, Thrór and his people re-established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and became very prosperous.  Thrór brought the [[Arkenstone]] back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]<ref name=""Durin""/> and the hall of feasting and council, the [[Great Chamber of Thrór]],<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>   was named after him.

Thrór and his people gained the friendship of the [[Northmen]] who lived along the river [[River Running|Celduin]].  These people later founded the town of [[Dale]] and had much trade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the Dwarves.  The [[Dwarves of Erebor]] also had much traffic of ores with their kinsman in the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for many years.
  
But in {{TA|2770|n}}<ref name=""TA""/> their prosperity ended.  The Dragon [[Smaug]] heard of the wealth of Thrór and his people.  He flew south from the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]] and sacked the Lonely Mountain, killing many Dwarves.  From the destruction many escaped, the last of them being Thrór and his son [[Thráin]] from  the hidden [[Back Door]].  With a small company of kin and faithful followers they made a great wandering southward, until they reached the hills of [[Dunland]].<ref name=""Durin""/>

On a [[Mid-year's Day]] under a broad crescent moon, Thrór created his [[Thrór's Map|map]] of the Lonely Mountain and the [[Desolation of the Dragon]].  In addition to the readily visible features on the map, Thrór added the details about the hidden [[Back Door]] into the Mountain, written in [[Moon-letters]] for secrecy.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>

===Dunland, and the journey to Moria===
In [[Dunland]], his people tried to make a living, but twenty years<ref name=""TA""/> after the [[Sack of Erebor]], despondent and homeless, Thrór left his people and went north with a single companion, [[Nár]].  Before leaving, Thrór gave his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] his [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]], along with the map and key to the Lonely Mountain.  Thrór wished to see the fabled city of his ancestors, [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].  

Eventually they made it over the [[Redhorn Pass]] down into [[Azanulbizar]], the Dimrill Dale.  Coming to the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] of Moria Thrór found it open.  Nár begged him to beware, but ignoring his companion Thrór walked through the gates as the heir who had returned.  But he did not come back.<ref name=""Durin""/>

[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|''Azog and Nár'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]
===Death===
Nár hid nearby for many days until he saw Thrór's body flung down the steps; his severed head lay face downward on the ground.  As he knelt there, Nar saw branded across his forehead in [[Angerthas Moria|Dwarvish runes]] the name [[Azog|AZOG]].   This [[Orcs|Orc]] then threw a small purse of coins at him, calling him a beggar.  Nár fled weeping down the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]], while Orcs emerged and hacked Thrór's body into pieces and fed them to the crows.<ref name=""Durin""/>

When Nár told Thráin what had happened, he declared war on the Orcs and called all the Seven Houses of the Dwarves together for vengeance. Nine years later in {{TA|2799}}<ref name=""TA""/> at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the climax of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], the death of Thrór was avenged when Azog was beheaded by [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. Thráin took Azog's severed head, shoved the purse of coins into his mouth and then set it on a stake.<ref name=""Durin""/>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that the name ''Thrór'' derives from ''Þrór'', a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. According to Allan, ''Þrór'' means ""boar"", deriving from a root meaning ""to expand"" (linking the meaning to Thrór's expanding of the ""''diggings and wealth of the Lonely Mountain''"").<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ""Giving of Names"", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 223</ref>

'''Aerin''', the daughter of [[Indor]],<ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 189</ref> was a [[House of Hador|kinswoman]] of [[Húrin]] in [[Dor-lómin]], taken as wife by [[Brodda|Brodda the Easterling]].

==History==
After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Brodda]] the [[Easterlings|Easterling]] became the lord of [[Hithlum]], and took her as his wife against her will, hoping thus to produce an heir. Aerin secretly helped [[Húrin]]'s wife [[Morwen]].<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 69</ref>

When [[Túrin]], son of Húrin, returned to [[Dor-lómin]], he learned from Aerin that his mother had left Hithlum.  In rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who immolated herself alive in her [[Brodda's hall|hall]] to prevent further torment from other Easterlings. From then on, the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] were to be persecuted even more cruelly than before.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
As [[Paul Strack]] points out, due the context in later [[legendarium]], the name should be [[Mannish]] Hadorian, but because its development in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works, it could be [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-797072021.html|articlename=Ed. ''Aerin'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=31 May 2024}}</ref> If that was the case it would include the element ''[[aer]]'' (""ocean""). The ending perhaps is the same in the names of ''Húrin'' and ''Túrin''; in that case the name would mean ""She who desires the Sea"".

==Other versions of the legendarium==

This character already appears in the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', with the [[Gnomish]] name '''''Airin'''''. She is described as ""of the long hair"", and she is also a kinswoman of [[Mavwin]] and wife of Brodda. Here he is not an Easterling, but it is said she had a horrible life by his side.<ref name=""Turambar"">{{LT2|II}}</ref>{{rp|91}}

When Mawvin decided to leave [[Hisilómë]] and go to [[Tinwelint]]'s realm, she asked Airin to put her daughter and properties under the care of Brodda. Airin conviced her husband of this without effort, but [[Nienóri]] refused to stay.<ref name=""Turambar"" />{{rp|93}}

She was not present when Turambar arrived at [[Brodda's hall]] and killed him. After the murder of Brodda and [[Orlin]], Airin appeared and stopped others from attacking Turambar. She was horrified by the crime, and Turambar did not dare to look upon her. Then she pronounced a public judgement, saying that Brodda was a bad lord and Turambar's wrath was just, but being a guest, killing his host was a terrible crime, as was killing Orlin of the same kind. Therefore she condemned Turambar to be disinherited and exiled for ever. Everyone there agreed with her, save Turambar, who asked to be killed right away. But the people there loved Airin and respected her, and Airin's secret wish to keep Túrin alive was fulfilled.<ref name=""Turambar"" />{{rp|89–91}}

She is given the Gnomish name '''''Faiglindra''''' (""long-tressed""); in [[Qenya]] '''''Firilanda'''''.<ref name=""Turambar"" />{{rp|93}}

'''Amlach''' (born {{FA|337}}) was the son of [[Imlach]] and a member of the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref>

==History==
In the years after they crossed the [[Blue Mountains]] into [[Beleriand]], the [[Men]] who would become known as the [[Edain]] dwelt mainly in encampments at [[Estolad]], south of [[Nan Elmoth]]. There, they were divided into two factions: the [[Elf-friend]]s, who argued that Men should ally themselves with the [[Eldar]] against [[Morgoth]], and the dissenters who wished to leave the war to the Elves. 

Around {{FA|369}} a council was held to debate the issue, and ""Amlach"" spoke forcefully against joining the [[Eldar]] in their war. After the council, though, it was discovered that Amlach had not even been present, and the speaker had been an emissary of Morgoth that had taken on his form. Amlach's anger at this deceit caused him to join the party of the Elf-friends, and he went north to [[Himring]] to enter the service of the Elf-lord [[Maedhros]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Amlach appears to be a [[Sindarin]] name, though its meaning is not entirely certain.  A possibility is ""Uprising Flame"" (from ''[[am]]'' = ""up, upwards"" and ''[[lhach|lach]]'' = ""flame (leaping)"").

'''Andreth''' was a wise-woman from the [[House of Bëor]]. She was called ''Saelind'' by the [[Elves]], for she was wise in thought and learned in the lore of [[Men]].<ref name=MR>{{MR|P4}}</ref>

==History==
Andreth was the elder daughter and second child of [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)|Boromir]] and a sister to [[Bregor]] and [[Beril]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref>

In her youth, she dwelt in the house of her uncle, [[Belemir]], where she had learned the lore of the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]] from his wife, the [[Wise-woman]] [[Adanel]].  

Andreth was deeply in love with the [[Noldor]]in Elf-lord [[Aegnor]], the son of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] and the brother of [[Finrod]], [[Angrod]], and [[Galadriel]]. During the [[Siege of Angband]], the Elf-lord saw young Andreth in the reflection of [[Aeluin]] and they fell in love with each other. However, he could not reciprocate her love, since, according to the law of the Eldar, no marriages could happen during times of war. It is said that for her sake, he would not take any Elven bride. Both remained unwed and childless. 

She grew in knowledge and understanding of lore, and as she grew older, she was respected as a wisewoman after Adanel.

She had a close friendship with Aegnor's eldest brother, [[King of Nargothrond|King]] Finrod of [[Nargothrond]], who often visited her during the Siege to converse with her wisdom on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.<ref name=MR/>

==Etymology==
''Andreth'' is a [[Sindarin]] word meaning ""long-suffering, 'Patience'"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 182</ref> Her other name, ''Saelind'', means ""Wise-heart"".<ref name=MR>{{MR|P4}}</ref>{{rp|305}}

'''Andróg''' was once a [[Dor-lómin|Man of Dor-lómin]] who was said to have the hardest heart of all of the outlaws within the [[Gaurwaith]].

== History ==
Andróg had been hunted down from [[Dor-lómin]] for the slaying of a woman and had fallen in with the Gaurwaith in the woods west of Doriath. He was with the band when they found a stranger in their territory. They surrounded the man and challenged him; the man was Túrin and he offered to fight them all. Andróg alone faced Túrin but deemed him the better man and voiced his support for Túrin to join the group.

Túrin stayed with the outlaws through the winter. One day in the following spring he saw a young woman fleeing from a man through a hazel-thicket. Túrin hewed her pursuer with his sword and only realized that he had killed [[Forweg]], the leader of the Gaurwaith, as the stroke went home.  Andróg then appeared for he had been chasing the woman with Forweg. Andróg would not strike Túrin for his deed and though the woman asked Túrin to kill Andróg for a reward from [[Larnach]], her father. Túrin refused and sent the woman home.

While Andróg buried Forweg, Túrin returned to the other outlaws and reported his deed.  Andróg returned and confirmed the story, and then Túrin claimed leadership of the Gaurwaith. Some of the outlaws wanted to kill Túrin but Andróg again supported him as the new leader.

Later, after Túrin had become the captain of the band, he went on a mission to spy upon [[Orcs]]. He left Andróg in command during his absence. While waiting for Túrin to return, the men with Andróg suddenly had [[Beleg]], Túrin's former companion, appear among them. Andróg captured the [[Elves|Elf]], tied him to a tree, and questioned him. Unsatisfied with his answers, Andróg proposed killing Beleg, in part because he desired his great bow.  However, [[Algund]] and the others stayed his hand, although Andróg insisted on leaving the Elf tied to a tree for two days. When Túrin returned the cruel treatment of Beleg prompted him to make a vow, for himself and the others, to refrain from raising a hand against Elves or Men.<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref>

After Beleg had left the outlaws the Orcs made greater incursions into their territory and Túrin led his men southward.  There they encountered three [[Petty-dwarves]] who tried to escape from the Gaurwaith. On of them, [[Mîm]], was captured, and Andróg fired at the remaining fleeing figures. When Mîm led Túrin's band to [[Amon Rûdh]] it was discovered that one of Andróg's arrows had killed [[Khîm]], the son of Mîm. Mîm's wrath was cooled when Túrin regretted the death and promised gold to Mîm if ever he came into wealth, but Mîm laid a curse upon Andróg: He had to break his bow and foreswear using bow and arrows in the future or else die by such himself. Andróg did break his bow but wished that Mîm die with a dart in his throat.

Mîm and the outlaws lived together in the [[Bar-en-Danwedh]] upon Amon Rûdh, yet only Túrin was comfortable with the dwarf. Andróg especially mistrusted the dwarf. He found out about a secret stair to the summit of the hill, but kept the discovery to himself. Andróg found more discomfort when Beleg reappeared to stay with the band, for he was jealous of the Elf's close friendship with Túrin.<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref>

Andróg eventually defied Mîm's curse and took up the bow again. In a foray from Bar-en-Danwedh Andróg was struck by a poisoned orc-arrow but he did not die for Beleg healed him. Mîm, who already hated Beleg, begrudged him even more for thwarting his curse although he believed that it would bite again. This it did when Mîm betrayed the location of the hideout to the Orcs, who assailed the stronghold, and Andróg received another arrow wound.

The Orcs roped Beleg to iron pins upon the summit of Amon Rûdh and left him there, expecting Mîm to kill the Elf. This would have happened except that Andróg, although mortally wounded, scared off the dwarf and as his last act cut through Beleg's bonds.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref>

Andróg's son [[Andvír]] survived the slaughter at [[Amon Rûdh]], and served as a source for [[Dírhavel]] for the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]''.<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}, p. 311</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Andróg'' is a name of an unknown meaning.

Upon returning home, Gorlim could not find any trace of Eilinel. He kept returning to their house seeking for his lost wife, and [[Sauron]] tricked him by devising a [[phantoms|phantom]] of Eilinel to make him betray the location of [[Barahir]].<ref name=S19/>

'''Gorlim the Unhappy''' was one of [[Barahir]]'s [[Barahir's outlaws|twelve followers]].

==History==
Gorlim, son of [[Angrim]], was married to [[Eilinel]]. He owned a small patch of land, with fields and woods.<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref> He joined his lord [[Barahir]] to the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and fought beside him to the last. He was one of only twelve survivors of the men that had gone to war.<ref name=S18>{{S|18}}</ref> But when he returned home after the war, he found his lands plundered, and Eilinel was nowhere to be found. He joined with Barahir, who had formed a small band of outlaws with the other surviving warriors. They retreated to [[Dorthonion]], where they managed to evade [[Morgoth]]'s troops for several years. 

Still uncertain about his wife's fate, Gorlim would at times depart the group alone and in secret, and return to his house to look for Eilinel. Morgoth's spies learned of this, and [[Sauron]] prepared a trap for him. One autumn, as Gorlim again ventured to his old abode, he saw what he thought was Eilinel, shining in the window. He was captured by Sauron's hunters, and tortured for information on the outlaws. After he refused to give any, the hunters promised to reunite him with his wife if he yielded. Gorlim, yearning for his lost love, faltered, and was brought before Sauron. Thinking his wife was captured by the Dark Lord, Gorlim offered the information in exchange for a free life with his wife. Sauron agreed, and after Gorlim had upheld his end of the bargain, revealed why: Eilinel was long dead, and Gorlim would indeed be reunited with her. He was put to death, cruelly. 

Barahir and the other outlaws were discovered and killed, except for Barahir's son [[Beren]], who had been on an errand. In a dream, the [[wraith]] of Gorlim appeared to him, and confessed his deeds. The wraith urged Beren to inform his father, but it was too late.<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the first version of the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', it was [[Morgoth]] himself, not Sauron, that tricked Gorlim into betraying Barahir.<ref>{{LB|C2}}, pp. 162-5, 169-170</ref>

== Adaptations ==
'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'''''
:An artifact known as the ""Frowning Skull"" contains a memory of Sauron interrogating Gorlim and tricking him into betraying his companions. At the end of the memory, it is stated by Sauron that his skull would be kept as a reminder of his irresistible will. The artifact's description also claims that the skull has been treasured by the ""Death's Head"", an assassin cult of Orcs within Mordor for a thousand years prior to the game's events, ""as a symbol of their glorious future free of the scourge of Man"".

'''Hunthor''' was a [[Men|Man]] of the [[House of Haleth]], and a kinsman of [[Brandir|Brandir the Lame]].

== History ==
When [[Glaurung]] was approaching [[Brethil]], [[Túrin]] asked who of the Men of Brethil would come with him to attempt to kill the dragon. [[Dorlas]] stepped forward immediately, but when no one else volunteered, he upbraided the lot of them, asking if none would take the place of Brandir so that the House of Haleth would not be put to shame. Hunthor, kinsman to Brandir, rebuked Dorlas since Brandir's lameness was due to ill chance. Hunthor then said he would go on behalf of Haleth's house.

Hunthor and Dorlas went with Túrin to [[Nen Girith]], where Túrin revealed his plan to climb down the [[Ravines of Taeglin]], cross the river, and ascend the other side so as to strike Glaurung's belly as he stretched across the gap.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref> Dorlas, who had deprecated the other Men of Brethil for lacking courage, could not bring himself to attempt to cross the rock-filled waters. Thus, only Túrin and Hunthor clambered up the west side of the ravine to make their attack.

Túrin and Hunthor were nearing the belly of the beast when the heat and stench of the dragon nearly caused Túrin to fall into the river, but Hunthor seized him and saved his life. Túrin proclaimed Hunthor to be of ""Great Heart!"" but even at the moment a stone struck Hunthor's head and he was lost in the [[Taeglin]].<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Hunthor'' is given no definition. In [[The Etymologies]], the similar name ''Hundor'' was derived from the [[Noldorin]] element ""hûn"" (""heart"", as in the physical organ).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> The element ""thor"" may be [[Nandorin]], as seen in ''[[Denethor (king of the Laiquendi)|Denethor]]''.

==Genealogy==
In ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' all that was said of Hunthor's family was that he was a kinsman of Brandir the Lame and thus a member of the House of Haleth.<ref>{{CH|16}}, p. 227</ref>  In ""[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]"", a story that appeared in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', Part Three (subtitled ""Other Writings Not Forming Part of the ''Quenta Silmarillion''""), the relationship of Hunthor to Brandir (and other details of his family) was made clear.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 270</ref>  Women in the family tree are indicated by ''italic'' text. The dagger symbol (†) shows those who died early (and childless) deaths (which indicates the ending of the House of Haleth).

== Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Quenta]]'', when Turambar seeks to confront Glómund, he is initially joined by six of his boldest men, but in the night they all slunk away in fear at the rumour of the dragon's arrival, leaving Turambar to confront it alone.<ref>{{SM|Q13}}</ref> In one earlier version of ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', ''''''Albarth'''''', changed from '''''Albard''''', was one of Túrin's six companions along with Dorlas. After crossing the Taiglin, Túrin noted that three of his companions were missing and was informed that Albarth fell and was swept away by the Taiglin, while the other two had likely been daunted and slunk away. After emending the tale closer to the final version, where Albarth becomes the one companion who remains with Túrin, his name is changed to '''''Torbarth''''' before becoming ''Hunthor''; in one instance, however, ''Torbarth'' was pencilled over with '''''Gwerin'''''.<ref name=ga_comment>{{WJ|P1c}}</ref>{{rp|§§322–5}}

''Gwerin'' is an early [[Noldorin]] name (precursor of [[Sindarin]] ''[[cerin]]'')<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 309 (first paragraph of the entry for ""Cerin Amroth . . . the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago"")</ref> meaning ""enclosure"".<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 146</ref> In his initial genealogy, Hunthor was the son of [[Hundad]] and brother of ''Harathor'' ([[Hardang]]).<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>

'''Huor''' was a [[Man]] of the [[House of Hador]]. He was the younger brother of [[Húrin]], the father of [[Tuor]], and thus the grandfather of [[Eärendel]]. 

Alongside Húrin, he fell in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], serving as a rearguard for [[Turgon|Turgon's]] escape.

==History==
=== Early life ===
Huor was born in {{FA|444}},<ref>{{GA|143}}</ref> as the second son of [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] and therefore of the House of Hador which ruled the realm of [[Dor-lómin]] as vassals under the [[House of Fingolfin]]. Huor was also closely akin to the [[House of Haleth]] through his mother [[Hareth]], and his uncle [[Haldir_(Chieftain_of_Brethil)|Haldir]] who was both the brother of Hareth and husband of Galdor's sister [[Glóredhel]]. 

Huor's elder brother was Húrin, and there was great love between them and they were seldom apart in their youth.<ref>{{CH|1}}</ref> At some point in their youth they were sent to [[Brethil]] to dwell as foster sons of Haldir, as was the custom among northern Men in those days.<ref name=coh>{{CH|1}}</ref>

=== An end of peace and mirth ===
In {{FA|455|n}}, Morgoth unleashed a terrible assault, in what became known as the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. In this battle, Galdor's father perished, and Galdor thus became the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]];<ref>{{GA|147}}</ref> shortly after, Fingolfin fell in a [[Fall of Fingolfin|duel with Morgoth himself]]. With the [[Siege of Angband]] broken, [[Orcs]] began harrying the northern borders of Brethil and Húrin and Huor, who would not be restrained, often went to battle with the Men of Brethil against them.<ref name=coh />

[[File:Mysilvergreen - Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin.jpg|thumb|left|''Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
By {{FA|458|n}}<ref name=ga161>{{GA|161}}</ref> Huor, though only thirteen, was already as tall as most full-grown men of that people.<ref name=coh /> In that year, a legion of Orcs came down the [[Sirion]] and the company of scouts Húrin and Huor were part of was ambushed and scattered. The brothers were pursued to the [[ford of Brithiach]] and there they would have been captured or slain but for a mist, thought to have been raised by [[Ulmo]], which hid them and allowed them to escape to [[Dimbar]]. There, they wondered in the hills beneath the [[Crissaegrim]], lost and in bewilderment at the deceits of that land. While wondering they were noticed by [[Thorondor]] who sent two [[Eagles]] to bear them beyond the mountains to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]], which no Man had before seen.<ref name=coh />

[[Turgon]], the King of Gondolin and son of Fingolfin, welcomed the brothers. Their ancestor [[Hador]] was an [[Elf-friend]], and Turgon had been counselled by Ulmo to deal kindly with his house as from them great help would come to him in time of need. Húrin and Huor thus dwelt as guests in Gondolin for nearly a year and Turgon spoke often with the brothers, developing a great liking for them. He thus wished to keep them in Gondolin for both love as well as law, for it was the law of the king that no one who entered Gondolin would be permitted to leave until he himself opened the leaguer and brought them forth.<ref name=coh />

But Húrin and Huor, with their time of hope and strength as Men being much shorter than that of Elves, desired to return to their people and share in their wars and griefs. They further argued that they knew not the way to Gondolin, being brought by air and their eyes by mercy being veiled. Turgon grieved at this, but relented and gave them permission to leave as they came, if the Eagles were willing.<ref name=coh />

[[Image:Catherine_Chmiel_-_Hurin,_Huor_and_Maeglin.jpg|right|thumb|''Hurin, Huor and Maeglin'', by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]
The king's sister-son, [[Maeglin]], however, loved not the kindred of Men; and while he did not grieve their leaving, he begrudged that Turgon should show them such favour as permitting it. He spoke to the brothers that some might wonder why the law should be abated for ""two knave-children of Men"", and that it would be better if they had no choice but to remain in Gondolin as servants until their life's end. In response, the brethren swore oaths to never to reveal the counsels of Turgon and to keep secret all that they had seen in his realm.<ref name=coh />

The Eagles then carried the brothers off at night, and set them down in Dor-lómin by dawn of the next day. Their kinsfolk rejoiced, as it was believed that they had been captured or slain, but the brothers would speak only that they had been rescued by the Eagles who had brought them home. When questioned by Galdor, who noted that they ""found food and fine raiment, and return as young princes, not as waifs of the wood"" Húrin shared further only that their return was permitted through an oath of silence, which they were still under. While Galdor did not press the matter, he and many others guessed at the truth, for both the the Eagles and the oath pointed to Turgon.<ref name=coh /> The strange fortune of the brothers, and their rumoured friendship with Turgon, became widely known, and reached the ears of the servants of Morgoth.<ref>{{GA|166}}</ref>

=== Last days of the House of Hador===
In {{FA|462|n}},<ref>{{GA|171}}</ref> Morgoth renewed his assault and threw a great force against King [[Fingon]] in Hithlum. The Orcs won many of the passes, besieged Fingon's fortress of [[Eithel Sirion]], and even came into Mithrim. Galdor, serving as captain in at Eithel Sirion in Fingon's stead,<ref name=coh /> was slain by an arrow.<ref name=lr156>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|§156}} Húrin then took up his lordship and command, with ""a fire in him that made the sword hot in his hand"". Behind Fingon and Hürin the Orcs were driven with great slaughter from the land, and pursued far even into [[Anfauglith]].<ref name=coh /><ref name=lr156 />

In {{FA|468|n}}, with the [[quest for the Silmaril|retrieval of a Silmaril]] by [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]] proving that Morgoth was not unassailable, the Elf-lord [[Maedhros]] assembled a [[Union of Maedhros|great union]] to oppose him, and soon cleared Beleriand of Orcs, restoring the frontiers to as they were prior to the Dagor Bragollach.

In {{FA|472|n}}, during the first days of spring, Huor wedded [[Rían]], the daughter of [[Belegund]] of the [[House of Bëor]], and they soon conceived a son who Huor named ""[[Tuor]]"" even before his birth. Two months following their wedding the summons came for the mustering of the hosts, and Huor and Húrin marched away in the army of Fingon.<ref>{{GA|218}}</ref>

The day of battle was decided to be the morning of Midsummer, and on that day came forces from many realms and lords. Within Fingon's assembled host, the Men of Dor-lómin under Húrin and Huor were placed on the right, joined by Men of Brethil under their uncle Haldir. Unlooked for, Turgon also arrived, having opened his leaguer to fight alongside his brother Fingon.<ref name=ch2>{{CH|2}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears|ensuing battle]], however, proved disastrous, and in the days that followed Morgoth's forces broke those of the Elves and Men that opposed him. Húrin and Huor stood, leading the remnant of the House of Hador, stood with Turgon and urged that he withdraw; as the last of the House of Fingolfin, in him lay the last hope of [[Eldar]]. Huor further prophesied, with the eyes of death, that from he and Turgon ""a new star shall arise"". Maeglin, who stood with Turgon, heard these words and did not forget them.<ref name=ch2>{{CH|2}}</ref>

As Turgon withdrew the Men of Dor-lómin provided rearguard, as desired by Húrin and Huor; they did not wish to escape from their lands, and if they could not win back their homes, they would stand to the end. After Turgon passed through the guard of Húrin and Huor, he passed down the Sirion and escaped. Húrin and Huor, however, drew what remained of the House of Hador and, foot by foot withdrew until they passed behind the [[Fen of Serech]] and held the stream of [[Rivil]] in front of them. There the hosts of Angband were slain in numbers such that they bridged the stream with their dead, but yet they managed to cross and encircle the Men of Dor-lómin. As the sunset, Huor was slain by a venomed arrow to the eye, while his men were slain about him. The Orcs then hewed off their heads and piled them as a mound of gold.<ref name=ch2 /> Huor's remains were then likely taken and piled into the [[Hill of the Slain]].<ref name=UT>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

===Legacy===
At Morgoth's orders, Húrin was taken alive and, after defying Morgoth's command to betray Turgon, he and his kin were cursed.

The lands of Dor-lómin were given to the [[Easterlings_(First_Age)|Easterling]] Men who betrayed Maedhros and they became known as the ""Incomers"". They were cruel to remaining folk of the House of Hador, seizing property and enslaving many.

Rían, seeking for Huor, ventured alone into the wild. There she would have perished if not succoured by the remaining [[Elves of Mithrim]] who led her to relative safety where she gave birth to Tuor. She soon departed again though, leaving Tuor in the care of the Elves and making her way to the Hill of the Slain where she lay down and died.

Tuor grew up among the Elves, but was captured and enthralled as a youth by the Incomers. He eventually managed to escape, became a messenger of Ulmo, and came to Gondolin to deliver a warning to Turgon to abandon the city. Though Turgon did not heed this warning, Tuor was placed in high-esteem and married Turgon's daughter, [[Idril]], with whom they bore a son, [[Eärendil]]. Tuor, Idril, and Eärendil managed to escape when a few years later [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin fell]].

Eärendil would go on to became one of the greatest heroes of Elves and Men. Following many adventures, he bore the Silmaril and sailed to [[Valinor]] where he plead for Elves and Men and instigated the [[War of Wrath]] which saw Morgoth overthrown. Eärendil was then placed by the [[Valar]] to sail in the skies, Silmaril still on his brow, as the [[Star of Eärendil]].

== Characteristics ==
Huor was the tallest of all the Edain save his own son Tuor only, and a swift runner.<ref>{{UT|2a}}</ref> He was noted as wielding an axe.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref> He was likely golden-haired and blue-eyed, as were many of the people of Hador.<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref>{{rp|§33}}

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Huor.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Huor'' was adapted to [[Sindarin]] from the language of the [[Edain]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 348, 364 (note 49)</ref>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Noldorin]] ''Huor'' (""'heart-vigour', courage"") derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''Khō-gorē'' ([[Sundocarme|root]] KHŌ-N- ""heart (physical)""). The [[Quenya]] version of ''Huor'' is said to be '''''Huore'''''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 364</ref> In the context of this etymology, it has been suggested that ''Huor'' can be analyzed as ''[[hûr]]'' (""vigour, fiery spirit"") + a derivative of root GOR (""violence, impetus, haste"").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 9 December 2011)</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 359 (entry GOR-)</ref>

'''Manthor''' was the younger son of [[Agathor]] and [[Meleth]] and Master of the [[North-march]] of [[Brethil]]. When [[Húrin]] came to Brethil, Manthor became caught up in the Curse of Morgoth upon Húrin and his descendants, dying in the troubles that Húrin stirred up.

== History ==
Manthor held land in eastern Brethil, near the [[Brithiach]] and along [[Sirion]] for some way.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 33, p. 303</ref> His cousin, Hardang, wished for Manthor to take up the line of the Chieftains of the [[House of Haleth]], but Hardang won the election. Hardang promoted Manthor to become the Captain of the Guards at the [[Crossings of Taeglin]].

Even before Húrin arrived in Brethil there was some ill-feeling between the branches and Hardang had little love for Manthor.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 55, p. 309</ref>

In {{FA|501}}<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 258</ref> after [[Húrin]] buried his wife [[Morwen]], he stumbled on to the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]] and lay down in a dark sleep. In the morning he was found by [[Sagroth]], one of Manthor's guards. [[Forhend]], thought it would be best to expel Húrin from the forest, while [[Avranc]], said that expulsion would not keep Húrin away and recommended killing him before he could wake.

At this point Manthor came up and berated the men for their immoral suggestions. He woke Húrin who at first thought that he was under attack, and Manthor calmed him, offering food and rest.  Húrin could not eat their food and spat it out, then demanded to go to the house of [[Hardang]], the Warden or [[Halad]] of Brethil. Manthor led Húrin to [[Obel Halad]] but Avranc ran ahead and reported to Hardang what had happened.

In the hall Hardang received Húrin with little courtesy, only giving him a stool after the old man had sat upon the floor. Manthor was grieved at the dishonor show to Húrin and rebuked Avranc for leaving his post, but Hardang reproved Manthor for raising the matter before a stranger. Then, in anger at his treatment, Húrin threw his stool at Hardang and cut him on the head.  Avranc arrested Húrin and he was imprisoned. Manthor assisted Húrin in walking, then returned to the hall where Avranc had urged that Húrin be put to death. Manthor stated that the deed of Húrin needed to be judged by all the folk and not just the Halad. When Hardang tried to send Manthor back to the marches he resigned his service and went to summon the folk.

Manthor went to the prison to see Húrin but found that this was forbidden by Avranc and Hardang. Citing the laws of the Folk, that a friend of a person accused was allowed to see the prisoner, he was let in. Manthor offered to be Húrin's counsel in the trial; at first the old man refused but gradually accented to the offer. Manthor warned Húrin that before his coming no sign of evil had shown in him until Húrin came and thus he perceived a shadow about the man that made lesser shadows grow darker.

The next morning guards from Hardang's household refused admittance to the prison to Manthor. Manthor went away and returned in the afternoon, and was then allowed to see Húrin.  Húrin seemed overly drowsy and Manthor grew suspicious. He took some of Húrin's uneaten food for testing and told the guards that he would eat with Húrin the next morning, thus forestalling any suspected tampering with his meal.

At the [[Folkmoot]] Manthor served as Húrin's defence counsel. When Hardang began reciting the charges against Húrin, Manthor pointed out that a man offended could not by the law make the formal accusation nor sit in judgement. In black anger Hardang chose Avranc as his replacement, a move that offended the elders since Avranc was but a youth. When the full charges were spoken it seemed at first that Húrin would be condemned, especially since Húrin refused to speak.  Manthor though pointed out that Húrin refused to speak due to his fetters.  After wrangling between Manthor and Avranc, Hardang allowed the fetters to be unfastened, hoping to calm the crowd.  Húrin then spoke and scorned the chieftain.  Then Manthor again calmed Húrin and spoke on his behalf. He explained that Húrin's behavior upon waking was reasonable since he had believed he was under attack. The food he rejected not out of scorn but because a half-starved man often cannot eat.  Manthor then revealed that Húrin's food had been drugged and that malice was abroad in Brethil. He stated that Húrin, kinsman to the [[House of Haleth]], had found nothing but dishonor in their land.  Manthor then said that Húrin had been provoked into tossing the stool. By the end of Manthor's speech the gathering of the Moot was calling for Húrin's freedom and his pardon.

Húrin then spoke of his errand to Brethil, which was to accuse Hardang of having deliberately refused aid to his wife Morwen, which led to her death.  When he strode toward Hardang the chieftain retreated in fear, which seemed to confirm his guilt. The result was a riot that Manthor could not contain; Hardang and his followers ran to the [[Obel Halad]] and were surrounded by the mob. When Manthor attempted to parley, Avranc shot an arrow at him that missed. This roused the mob to set Hardang's hall on fire. When Hardang and Avranc tried to escape only the young man succeeded while the Warden was killed.

Manthor then denied Húrin's charge that Hardang had mistreated his wife. He agreed to go with Húrin to Morwen with others to give her a proper burial.  The next day they did so but as they were returning Avranc shot Manthor with an arrow, this time mortally wounding him.  Húrin called Manthor a valiant friend, but wondered if he was so ardent in Húrin's cause in part for himself, since he would have been a more worthy chieftain. Manthor agreed that part of Húrin's darkness had touched him, bringing out his ambitions. But as Manthor died he noted that Húrin and Túrin had brought ruin upon the House of Haleth, for the coming of these two men had led to the deaths of [[Brandir]], [[Hunthor]], Hardang, and himself.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 275-297</ref>

== Genealogy ==
In the family tree below the relationships between the third generation after [[Halmir]] are of importance to the story. The position of ''Halad'' or Warden of Brethil had passed (by election and custom) from father to son to [[Brandir|Brandir the Lame]]. When he died childless there were factions for either Hardang (as the next senior branch of the family) or Manthor (as the better leader) to be the next Halad. Hardang was chosen but Manthor's faction remained dissatisfied. Women in the family tree are indicated by ''italic'' text. The dagger symbol (†) shows those who died early (and childless) deaths - which shows the ending of the House of Haleth.

'''Sador''' was a carpenter and servant of [[Húrin]], and the childhood friend of Húrin's son [[Túrin]].

==History==
Sador was a woodman who fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. He came too late to the battle field however, and was only able to bring back the fallen [[Hador]]. He was then stationed at [[Eithel Sirion]], and was there when Húrin took command. But he tired of war, and returned to his woods, at which point he accidentally severed his right foot. He remarked to Túrin that, ''""a man that flies from his fear may find that he has only taken a short cut to meet it""''. The remaining part of his leg had shrunken from lack of use.<ref name=""Sador"" />

One of Sador's talents was wood-working. Sador became a ""house-man in the service of Húrin""; in spite of being a simple servant, Sador was wise and shared with young Túrin many insights about the nature of [[Men]], [[Elves]], and fate.<ref name=""Sador"">{{CH|1}}, p. 41-44</ref>

Sador worked in the outbuildings, fixing things around the house which were usually of little importance. He was Túrin's best friend during his youth, and the boy would often help Sador by fetching materials and tools to spare him from walking. When Túrin brought him gifts he ""found"" lying around, Sador would tell the boy to return them, and taught him he shouldn't steal even if it is to give. Sador enjoyed Túrin's company and would often carve for him figures of men and beasts, although Túrin enjoyed Sador's stories the most.

On Túrin's birthday, his father gave him an [[Elves|Elven]] knife of great worth. Túrin pitied Sador and decided to give the gift to him. Sador accepted the gift as it would be rude not to, but he knew he would be unable to repay Túrin for such a gift.

Túrin's mother, [[Morwen]], did not care for Sador and called him ""self-maimed by his own want of skill, and he is slow with his tasks, for he spends much time on trifles unbidden."" But Túrin noted that his act of generosity resulted in Sador being treated more kindly. At this time Sador set out to carve a great throne for the hall of Húrin.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 48-50</ref>

After Túrin departed, Sador remained in the house of [[Morwen]], though he wished he may have joined the battle to die a valiant death. Upon Túrin's return from [[Nargothrond]] many years later, Sador joined in the rebellion against the [[Easterlings]] who had taken over the land. He was then wounded and perished.<ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 189</ref>

==Etymology==
''sador'' is a [[Sindarin]] word which translates to ""steadfast, trusty, loyal"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 183</ref>

==Other names==
Sador had several names including:
*'''''Labadal''''', Sindarin for ""hopafoot"", given to Sador by Túrin.<ref name=""Sador"" />
*'''Onefoot''', an epithet referring to his lack of a right foot.<ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 184</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
According to a c.

'''Ulrad''' was a member of the [[Gaurwaith|outlaw band]] that [[Túrin]] joined.

== History ==
Ulrad was a friend of the outlaw who shot an arrow at Túrin but was killed when his arrow missed.  Túrin was challenged by Ulrad but gave way when Túrin approached him.<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 101</ref>

After Túrin had become the leader of the outlaws by unintentionally slaying [[Forweg]], the former leader, Ulrad remained as one of his followers.  When [[Beleg]] was captured while Túrin was away, Ulrad believed Beleg to be a spy and later held a flaming brand as the other outlaws prepared to kill the Elf, although Túrin returning stopped them.<ref>{{CH|6}}, pp. 112-113</ref>

Ulrad travelled with the other outlaws to [[Bar-en-Danwedh]].  Although he was one who looked in [[Mîm]]'s sack and found nothing, he later suspiciously asked the Petty-dwarf why he had been so protective of the sack.  Mîm answered him angrily and Ulrad quailed at this words, and Túrin upbraided the timid outlaw for always speaking his thoughts.<ref>{{CH|7}}, pp. 135-136</ref>

Ulrad's fate is not known for certain, but he was likely lost in that stronghold when it was overcome by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 150</ref>

He was slain by the [[sons of Fëanor]] in their attempt to reclaim the [[Nauglafring]].<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, pp. 240-1</ref> 

Auredhir disappeared completely in later versions of the legendarium,<ref>{{LT2|IVn}}, p. 251</ref> replaced by the characters of [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]].

'''Earissë''' was the daughter of [[Lindo]] and the wife of [[Ælfwine]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] associated with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. She was the mother of [[Heorrenda]] and [[Hlúdwine]].<ref name=Ear>{{PE|15}}, ""[[Names and Required Alterations]]"", Appendix, ''Text XI'' and ''Text XII'', p. 18</ref>

Earissë only appears in two of the notes in the ''[[Notebook C]]'',<ref name=Ear/> a small pocket-book which [[Tolkien]] used for notes and suggestions while writing ''The Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{LT2|V}}, p. 254</ref>

Nothing else is known about her.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Earissë'' is in [[Qenya]], probably being a phonological imitation of the English name '''''Edith''''' and its [[Old English]] form ''Eadgyth''. ''Eadgyth'' consists of the elements ''éad'' (""riches, prosperity, good fortune, happiness"") + ''gyth'', a form of ''gúð'' (""combat, battle, war"").<ref name=Ear/>

The first element of the name ''Earissë'' might be ''[[ea(r)]]/[[earen]](-d)'' (""eagle""), the second being ''[[-ssë]]'', a feminine name ending occurring in several other names in the early [[legendarium]].<ref name=Ear/>

An earlier form of the name was ''Eadissë''.<ref name=Ear/>

'''Lindo''' was the wise keeper of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] in [[Tol Eressëa]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. His wife was [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]], and his father was [[Valwë]].<ref name=Cottage>{{LT1|I}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

== History ==
The mariner [[Eriol]], who searched for strange lands, eventually came to the isle of Tol Eressëa. There he wandered, until reaching the center of the isle and the city of [[Kortirion]]. Growing tired as the night drew in, he sought for a place to rest. He spotted The [[Cottage of Lost Play]], with its many small windows curtained snugly, filled with a warm light. He knocked on the door as was greeted by the Lord of the Cottage, Lindo and his wife Vairë.

After introductions, Lindo explained that the dwelling was called Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva, or the Cottage of Lost Play. Alongside him there were many other elves, and mannish children of various sizes. He perceived Eriol's curiosity and said: ""''Small is the dwelling, but smaller still are they that dwell here - for all who enter must be very small indeed, or of their own good wish become as very little folk even as they stand upon the threshold''.""<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|13–4}}

Lindo and Vairë accepted Eriol's request for entrance and lodging, and invited him in. Soon after, they made their way to the great hall, where an evening meal was set out. [[Gong of the Children|Tombo]], the Gong of Children rang out and all the children of the dwelling joined them for supper, including [[Littleheart]], the Gong-warden. They sang the song of the [[Bringing in of the Meats]] and Lindo blessed the food and company.

During dinner, Eriol asked Lindo and his wife about the isle of Tol Eressëa. Lindo explained Eriol had come into the region of [[Alalminórë]], or the Land of Elms at the center of the isle, which was the fairest of the realms of Tol Eressëa, and then to the city above it of Kortirion. He told of the isle's leader [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], who was a descendant of [[Ingwë|Inwë]], the King of all the Eldar when they dwelt in [[Kôr]]. At this isle is where many of the wisest and fairest of all the Eldar gathered, including Lindo's father [[Valwë]], and his wife's father [[Tulkastor]].<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|14–6}}

All but Eriol filled their cups with [[limpë]], which was a special drink that would give youth, but that only Meril-i-Turinqi could give to one who was not Eldar or that already dwelt with them. The gong sounded again, and the company moved to the [[Room of Logs]] where a magic fire burnt endlessly. There they would gather often for story time and now Vairë told him the history of the land. She spoke of [[Olórë Mallë]], or the Path of Dreams, and of a white cottage that stood in its fairest garden. None knew of what it was built or when. This was then called the Cottage of Children and the Eldar guarded it fiercely, goading the children of men to play there. This was to protect them from straying into Valinor and abandoning their parents or returning and being unsatisfied with the world ever after. After the elves left Kôr, the Cottage of Children was abandoned and blocked off forever.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|17–9}}

Meril-i-Turinqi chose Lindo and Vairë to care for the remainder of the children who had been to Kôr. The two built the new Cottage of Lost Play where the children then lived, though some would depart to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], and stay, becoming lost in the wonderous lands there. The rest return and bring stories to Lindo and Vairë.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|20}}

== Etymology ==
''Lindo'' is a [[Qenya]] name, probably meaning ""Singer"". The [[Gnomish]] version of the name was '''''Glinda''''' (probably related to ''glin'' ""sound, voice, utterance"").<ref>{{PE|15}}, pp. 6-7, 9</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In one note to ''[[The Cottage of Lost Play]]'', there appears a character called '''Nelmir'''. In that text, she is depicted as the wife of Eriol and the mother of [[Heorrenda]] ''and'' [[Hendwine]], a character who doesn't appear in any of the narratives of ''The Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{PE|15}}, ""[[Names and Required Alterations]]"", Appendix, ''Text X'', p. 17</ref>

Nothing else is known about her and her relation to [[Lindo]] and Vairë, and it is unclear if ''Nelmir'' was supposed to be just another name for ''Naimi'' or an altogether separate character.

The name ''Nelmir'' seems to be in Qenya, but, as with ''Naimi'', its meaning is unclear.<ref name=""Eld""/>

She was a little girl living in the [[Cottage of Lost Play]]. When [[Eriol]] was playing with the people of the house at the [[Hall of Play Recovered]], they felt tired and sat beside the fire. 
Then Vëannë climbed on Eriol's knee and asked him to recount about Men and their children in Great Lands (""''...didst thou have a garden there such as we?''""). He told her about his life and battles he had seen, and Vëannë concluded that wars are terrible. Then Eriol asked the children to tell some tale they had heard instead, and she volunteered to tell the ""[[Tale of Tinúviel]]"".<ref name=Tinuviel>{{LT2|I}}</ref>{{rp|4–8}}

Before beginning the tale, she argued with [[Ausir (boy)|Ausir]], who suggested [[Qenya|Elvish]] names ''[[Thingol|Tinwë Linto]]'' and ''[[Melian|Wendelin]]'' instead of [[Gnomish]] ''[[Thingol|Tinwelint]]'' and ''[[Melian|Gwendeling]]''. But she claimed that much earlier, when she was on the [[Path of Dreams]], she saw Gwendeling and [[Luthien|Tinúviel]]. She started the story describing Gwendeling.<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|8}} After she finished the tale describing the death of [[Beren]], Eriol said that such a sad story heard from the mouth of a beautiful maiden calls for compassion. She wept and said that she does not remember what was later. Other children, including Ausir, helped her say that Beren and Tinúviel returned to life, but as mortals. Then Eriol said that he was not expecting such a story from little maidens of [[Cottage of Lost Play|Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva]]. She answered that she learned it by heart from books but does not understand it fully.<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|40–41}}

==Etymology==
''Vëannë'' is clearly [[Qenya]], but it is never glossed. During their conversation, Eriol gave her the name '''''Melinir''''' (while she named him ''Melinon''),<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|5}} which is clearly derived from ''mel-'' (""love"").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry ""Melian""</ref>

'''Lindir''' was an Elf of [[Rivendell]]. 
== History ==
After [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s rendition of his ''[[Eärendillinwë]]'', Lindir claimed that he was unable to tell which parts were written by [[Aragorn]], and which by Bilbo himself, explaining that he knew little of [[Mortals]] and their ways.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Lindir'' seems to be composed of ''[[lind]]'' (""tune"") + ''dîr'' (""man""), therefore meaning ""Song Man"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1574701031.html|articlename=S.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Lindir is portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]]. He welcomes Gandalf and the party of Dwarves to Rivendell in place of Elrond. Gandalf asks him where Elrond is and is answered by his horn, signalling Elrond and his companion's return from hunting Orcs. As Elrond and Gandalf speak, Elrond hands Lindir his spear. Later, after the dwarves have been living in Rivendell for a while, Lindir and Elrond talk. Lindir tells Elrond that the kitchen is under strain and that their supply of wine has almost drained by the Dwarves feasting, asking Elrond how long the Dwarves will stay. Elrond tells Lindir it has yet to be decided. They turn the corner and watch uncomfortably as the Dwarves play naked in the fountain. During a [[White Council]] meeting, Lindir reports to Lord Elrond that [[Thorin]] and his companions have departed in secret.<ref name=""IMCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> McKenzie also appeared in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] as an extra dubbed ""[[Figwit]]"" by fans.

'''Eldalótë''' was the wife of [[Angrod]]. Their son was [[Orodreth]], a [[lord of Nargothrond]].<ref name=Eldalote>{{PM|XI4}}, p. 346</ref> 

She probably joined the [[Exile of the Noldor]], as her name was translated into Sindarin in later legend, but she is not mentioned in any of the tales of [[Beleriand]].<ref group=note>This can be assumed by considering a note that [[Finarfin]] was ""the only name of a Ñoldo who did not come into exile to receive a Sindarin form""; therefore as Eldalótë also had a Sindarin name, she was one of the Exiles. Cf. {{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 31</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Eldalótë'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Elven-flower"", from ''[[Elda]]'' (""Elf"") + ''[[lótë]]'' (""flower""). The [[Sindarin]] form of her name was '''''Eðellos''''' (spelled ''Edhellos'').<ref name=Eldalote>{{PM|XI4}}, p. 346</ref>

'''Erestor''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Rivendell]], and the chief counsellor of [[Elrond]].

== History ==
Erestor, being the chief counsellor of [[Elrond]]'s household at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], took part in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He did not support the idea of destroying [[The One Ring|the Ring]], and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from [[Sauron]], perhaps with the aid of [[Tom Bombadil|Iarwain ben-adar]]. His suggestion was countered by [[Glorfindel]], as well as [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]], as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Sauron's.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

Erestor accompanied [[Arwen]] to her marriage with [[Aragorn]] in [[Gondor]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Erestor'' is in [[Sindarin]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-337200237.html|articlename=S. ''Erestor'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=08 August 2023}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the earliest introduction of Erestor, he was one of three counsellors of Elrond's (the other two being unnamed); all three were kinsmen of Elrond's, ""of that half-elvish folk whom the Elves named the children of [[Lúthien]]"". In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Elflords of Rivendell, with Erestor being the sole remaining half-elf and kinsman of Elrond.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>

In the initial selection for the Nine of the Company of the Ring, Erestor was to represent the half-Elves.<ref>{{TI|Ring}}</ref>

Originally, only Elrond, [[Galadriel]], and [[Celeborn]] accompany Arwen to her wedding.<ref>{{SD|Vs}}</ref>

:Prior to the Fellowship's departure from [[Rivendell]], Erestor is involved in a quest exclusive to the Elven characters. After the [[War of the Ring]], he joins the procession from Rivendell that travels to [[Minas Tirith]] for Lady [[Arwen]]'s wedding.

'''Fimbrethil''' or '''Wandlimb''' was [[Treebeard]]'s long-lost [[Entwives|entwife]].<ref name=""Treebeard"">{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==History==
The pair were beloved since before even [[Morgoth]] first arose in power during the youth of the world. As with all of the other Entwives, Fimbrethil had been missing since [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]] during the Second Age.<ref name=""Treebeard""/> At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Treebeard had not seen his beloved Fimbrethil for over 3,000 years. 

During the [[Battle of Isengard|last march of the Ents]] against [[Isengard]], Treebeard felt that many of the Ents were marching to their doom, and that indeed, he might never see his Fimbrethil ever again. Treebeard told [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that Saruman had to be stopped, although he would dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil once again.<ref name=""Treebeard""/>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Fimbrethil'' consists of the words ''[[fim]]'' and ''[[Brethil (Sindarin word)|brethil]]''.

Different translations given by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] were: ""slender-beech"",<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref> ""slim-birch"",<ref>{{RK|I2}}</ref> and ""slender princess"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 23, 82</ref>

'''Leaflock''', called '''Finglas''' in [[Sindarin]], was one of the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]]. 

== History ==
Finglas, [[Skinbark|Fladrif]], and [[Treebeard|Fangorn]] were the oldest of the [[Ents]] of Fangorn Forest still alive in the later [[Third Age]].

According to [[Treebeard]], Leaflock had become tired, sometimes sleeping through entire seasons (although formerly he used to rouse up in winter), and tree-like with a covering of leafy hair.<ref name=iii4>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Finglas'' is apparently composed by the two elements ''[[fing]]/[[find]]'' ""lock of hair"" and ''[[las]]'' ""leaf"".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry ""Finglas""</ref>

The element ''lock'' in ''Leaflock'' here has the meaning of ""hair"" since it is a translation of his [[Sindarin]] name.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

The name obviously refers to his being ""Covered with leafy hair"".<ref name=iii4/>

'''Skinbark''' (also known as '''Fladrif''') was, with [[Treebeard]] and [[Leaflock]], one of the three oldest [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]].

'''Bergil''' was a boy of [[Minas Tirith]].

==History==
Bergil was born around {{TA|3009}} and was the eldest son of [[Beregond]] of [[Gondor]]. He had at least one younger brother, [[Borlas]]. 

A boy at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], he accompanied [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] when he first arrived in the city of [[Minas Tirith]]. He led Pippin to the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]] to view the men from the various provinces of Gondor coming to [[Pelennor]] to reinforce the city against the impending [[Siege of Gondor|siege]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 769</ref>

Bergil served the [[Houses of Healing]] during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p.859</ref> He found ''athelas'' for [[Aragorn]], which was used to heal [[Faramir]], [[Éowyn]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]].<ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p. 865</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bergil'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. It could be a combination of [[root]] [[BER]] (""valiant"") + ''[[gil]]'' (""star"").

'''Imrahil''' was the twenty-second [[Prince of Dol Amroth]]. 

==History==

===Early life===
Imrahil was the only son of [[Adrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]]. He had two older sisters, [[Ivriniel]] and [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]]. After his father's death, he became Prince in {{TA|3010}}. Imrahil had four children:  [[Elphir]], [[Erchirion]], [[Amrothos]] and [[Lothíriel]].<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[Image:John Howe - Prince Imrahil.jpg|120px|left|thumb|''Prince Imrahil'' by [[John Howe]]]]
During the [[War of the Ring]], Imrahil came to the aid of his brother-in-law, [[Denethor|Denethor II]]. On [[9 March]], {{TA|3019}}, he came into [[Minas Tirith]] with a company of knights and seven hundred soldiers.<ref name=""MT"">{{RK|MT}}, p. 771</ref>
On [[13 March]], as [[Southrons]] harassed [[Faramir]], Imrahil and his knights, with [[Gandalf]], formed a sortie, and Imrahil himself saved his sister-son from his pursuers.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, pp. 820-21</ref> Faramir received a poisonous wound, and Denethor fell to madness. Being the highest ranking officer in [[Gondor]] fit for battle, Imrahil took command, and quickly passed it on to Gandalf. 

Two days later, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] raged before the city. Imrahil ventured outside the city, and witnessed the funeral procession of [[Théoden]]. Here he beheld [[Éowyn]], and wondered that Rohan would send even women in Gondor's great need. Though Théoden had passed, Imrahil recognised that Éowyn still lived (though she was near death), and ordered that she be taken to the [[Houses of Healing]]. 

Because [[Éomer]] and his riders were outnumbered, Imrahil rode into battle, together with [[Húrin (Warden of the Keys)|Húrin the Tall]], [[Forlong|Forlong of Lossarnach]] and [[Hirluin|Hirluin the Fair]], and they were soon joined by [[Aragorn]] who landed at [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]]. Imrahil continued East, driving the frightened [[Variags]] and [[orcs]] away. 

Imrahil survived the battle unscathed, and together with Éomer and Aragorn he came to the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]].<ref name=""Battle"">{{RK|Battle}}, p. 849</ref> Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city, because he knew Denethor was strong-willed and proud. 

When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the temporary position of Steward. Though Aragorn also declared that Gandalf should lead them in all things for the remaining days of the war, to which Imrahil agreed.

On [[16 March]], {{TA|3019}}, [[Legolas]] recognized that Imrahil had elven-blood when he looked at him during their meeting in Minas Tirith.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 872</ref> On the same day Imrahil participated in the [[Last Debate|debate]] of the [[Captains of the West]]. Gandalf proposed that they march to the [[Morannon]] to distract Sauron's attention from [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] the Ring-bearer. Aragorn agreed to this advice and said that he did not yet claim to command any man, so the others should choose if they wanted to follow it. Imrahil said that he considered Aragorn to be his liege-lord, regardless whether Aragorn claimed it or not and that he would follow him. Imrahil also stated that he stood in the place of the [[Steward of Gondor]] and advised that some troops should remain to protect the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed at the thought.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, pp. 878-82</ref> [[Húrin the Tall]] was left behind in command.

The [[Host of the West]] left Minas Tirith on [[18 March]]. Bypassing [[Minas Morgul]] and marching North, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar at Imrahil's advice. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood on the front line with his men. They fought the [[Battle of the Morannon]] until [[the One Ring]] was destroyed.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 891</ref>

Prince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the [[field of Cormallen]], and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in [[Edoras]] after the King's burial on [[August 10]]. Imrahil and Éomer became great friends, and in {{TA|3021}} Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter [[Lothíriel]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', entry 2991-F.A. 63 ''Éomer Éadig'', p. 1070</ref>

===Later life===
After the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew [[Faramir]], [[Prince of Ithilien]], were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Great [[Council of Gondor]], and remained an advisor of the King.<ref>{{L|244}}</ref>

Prince Imrahil died in the year {{FoA|34|n}} of the [[Fourth Age]], and was succeed by his eldest son [[Elphir]], who continued the line of Princes.<ref name=""Elendil"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Imrahil.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Imrahil'' is an [[Adûnaic]] name.<ref>{{App|Consonants}}, entry CH, p. 1113</ref><ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F2, §9 footnote concerning names in Quenya</ref> Its meaning is not glossed.

The second element ''-hil'', also seen in the name ''[[Adrahil]]'', is perhaps related to the [[Westron]] ending ''-kil''<ref group=""note"">This ending is found in words like ''[[banakil]], [[Tarkil]]'' and possibly means ""man""</ref> and perhaps ultimately related to [[Elvish]] ""follower"" ([[KHILI#Other versions|KHIL]]).<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry '''tark''', p. 101</ref><ref name=""LR"">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''KHIL-''', p. 405</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130308120545/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html|articlename=Etymologies of Atani languages|website=Lalaith's Science Pages}}</ref>

Considering the Elvish root KHIL, [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] have proposed as a possible meaning ""Heir of Imra"" with the first element ''Imra'' being the same as the first element in the name [[Imrazôr]] and the second element ''-hil'' (""heir"").<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], [[Patrick Wynne]], ""An Adunaic Dictionary"", published in ''[[Vinyar Tengwar 25]]'' (September [[1992]]), pp. 16-17</ref>

'''Ingold''' was a soldier of [[Gondor]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
At the time of the War of the Ring, Ingold was the leader of a guard of [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] soldiers posted at the [[Forannest]], the northern gate of [[Rammas Echor]], the encircling wall of [[Pelennor Fields]]. They were repairing the wall on 8 March, when [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] with Ingold’s permission passed into the townlands of [[Minas Tirith]] on their journey from [[Rohan]] to the city of Gondor.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>

Less than five days after Gandalf had passed through, an army from the [[Rhûn|East]] had crossed the River [[Anduin]] and broke the Rammas. Ingold’s guard was the last to escape from the host, reporting to Minas Tirith that the northward road had been taken by the enemy. Due to Ingold’s news, it was thought that the [[Rohirrim]] could not come to Gondor’s aid.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', or ''i·[[Noldor|Ñoldo]]'', was the [[Amilessë|mothername]] of both [[Finarfin]] and his son [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. It became a frequently given name in [[Númenor]]; in the [[Third Age]] in Gondor, it was shortened to Ingold under influence of [[Westron]].<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 30</ref>

:Ingold is first met defending the northern gate of [[Rammas Echor]] where he tasks the player with slowing the enemy's advance and repelling the attacks on the wall, but eventually retreats to Minas Tirith. After the downfall of [[Sauron]] he becomes part of Gondorian army tasked with entering the Black Land and dealing with the evil that remains within. After King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] charges Steward [[Faramir]] with cleansing the evil of [[Minas Morgul]], Ingold and his men traverse the plateau of [[Gorgoroth]] and enter the [[Morgul Vale]] from the east.

'''Ondoher''' ({{TA|1787}}<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1944|n}},<ref name=""South"">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 157 years) was the thirty-first [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
===Renewing Old Ties===
Ondoher became King in {{TA|1936}} upon the death of his father, [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]].<ref name=""South"" />  During his reign, and that of [[Araphant]] of [[Arthedain]], the long-estranged kingdoms of the [[Dúnedain]] took counsel again, for they finally perceived that some single will and power was coordinating the multiple assaults upon their kingdoms.  In a sign of their renewed relationship, Ondoher's daughter [[Fíriel]] married Prince [[Arvedui]] of [[Arthedain]] in {{TA|1940|n}}.<ref name=""Gondor"">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

However, neither kingdom could aid the other when new evils set upon them - in the North [[Angmar]] attacked Arthedain while in the South the [[Wainriders]] struck in great force.  Ondoher was not taken unaware by the renewed assault for [[Forthwini]] of [[Éothéod]] had informed the King that the Wainriders had recovered from their fears and weaknesses.  Ondoher also learned that Gondor's southern enemies were preparing to attack.  He raised as great an army as he could to meet the double threat.

Ondoher divided his strength into two armies, assigning the smaller [[Southern Army]] to [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], a member of the Royal House descended from King [[Telumehtar Umbardacil|Telumehtar]].  This army was based at [[Pelargir]] while Ondoher took command of the larger [[Northern Army]] himself, which included his elder son [[Artamir]].  This arrangement was acceptable provided that an undisputed heir to the throne was left behind, in this case Ondoher's younger son, [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]].

===The Deaths of Ondoher and His Sons===
In {{TA|1944}} the enemies of [[Gondor]] made a double assault: First the [[Haradrim]] invaded from the south, and then a few days later word came of the [[Wainriders]] invading from the east.  While Ëarnil moved to deal with the southern incursion, the northern army headed north through [[Ithilien]], planning to deploy upon the [[Dagorlad]].  Unfortunately, the Wainriders moved faster than expected along the outskirts of the [[Ered Lithui]] and struck the head of Gondor's army before any defensive dispositions had been made.  Swiftly the enemy's chariots and horsemen overwhelmed the King's Guard, killing both Ondoher and Artamir at the [[Disaster of the Morannon]].

King Ondoher's sister-son, [[Minohtar]] attempted to stem the onslaught of the Wainriders.  During the rout the [[leader of the Éothéod]] brought to Minohtar the body of Faramir, who had disguised himself in order to fight with a party of the Éothéod.  Soon Minohtar himself was slain as the enemy poured into northern Ithilien.

==Selecting the Next King==
The suddenness of their victory was the Wainriders' undoing.  Unbeknownst to them Eärnil had crushed the [[Haradrim]] and was racing north to aid the northern army.  His attack upon the feasting Wainriders, later known as the [[Battle of the Camp]], defeated the Wainriders and sent them reeling back into the East.<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref>

With King Ondoher and both of his male heirs dead, Arvedui of Arthedain sought the throne of Gondor.  Arvedui put forth two arguments in support of his claim: First, he was the direct descendant of [[Isildur]], whom Arvedui said had never relinquished his royalty in Gondor.  Second, his wife [[Fíriel]] was King Ondoher's daughter and by the ancient [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] law the sceptre should have been hers.  But Arvedui's claim was rejected by the Steward [[Pelendur]] and the Council of Gondor.  The crown was granted to the victorious general Eärnil, of the royal [[House of Anárion]] who took the crown as King [[Eärnil II]].<ref name=""Gondor"" />

==Etymology==
Ondoher is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it means ""Stone Lord"" and is a compound of [[ondo]] (""stone"") and ''[[heru|hér]]'' (""lord""),<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1359985459.html|articlename=Q. ''Ondoher'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=28 July 2021}}</ref> in reference to Gondor, the ""Stone Land"".

The name ""Ondoher"" was spelled as ''Ondohir'' in early manuscripts, changed to ''Ondonir'' in a later manuscript, reverted to ''Ondohir'' in the first edition of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', and finally became ''Ondoher'' in the second edition.<ref name=""Elendil"" />

'''Turgon''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2855|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref> – {{TA|2953|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 98 years) was the twenty-fourth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Turgon was the son of Steward [[Túrin II]]. Unlike his father's reign (and his son's), his rule was apparently peaceful and uneventful, as no significant events for Gondor are recorded during those thirty-nine years.

However, it was near the end of his rule, in {{TA|2951}}, when [[Sauron]] declared himself openly in [[Mordor]]; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding [[Barad-dûr]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

His son [[Ecthelion II|Ecthelion]] succeeded him to the throne.

==Etymology==
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Turgon#Etymology|Turgon - Etymology]]. Turgon was probably named after [[Turgon]], a [[High King of the Noldor]] of the [[First Age]] who founded the hidden city of [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 203</ref>

{{quote|[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] saw her whom few [[mortals]] had yet seen; '''Arwen''', daughter of [[Elrond]], in whom it was said that the likeness of [[Lúthien]] had come on earth again; and she was called [[Undómiel]], for she was the Evenstar of her people.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[Many Meetings]]""}}

'''Arwen Undómiel''', often called '''Arwen Evenstar''', was one of the [[half-elven]], married to [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]. She was the daughter of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]].<ref name=""Tale"" />

She was considered to be the fairest of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in the [[Third Age]], resembling [[Lúthien]] of the [[First Age]] who would never again appear in [[Ëa]]. Her romance with [[Aragorn]] was reminiscent of that between the Man [[Beren]] and the Elf Lúthien.  Like Lúthien, she rejected her [[Elves|Elven]] immortality to marry Aragorn and die with him.<ref name=""Tale"" />

==History==
[[File:Anna Lee - Evenstar.jpg|thumb|left|''Evenstar'' by [[Anna Lee]]]]

Arwen was born in {{TA|241}} and was the younger sister of [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> From her mother she inherited the [[Elfstone]].<ref name=""CG"">{{UT|6}}</ref> As one of the half-elven, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate. She lived most of her life in [[Imladris]], or in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandparents.<ref name=""Tale"" />

Her father fostered the sons of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], who were the exiled [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> It was in {{TA|2952}} when she returned from Lothlórien to Rivendell when she met a young foster-son of her father, [[Aragorn]]. The young [[Dúnadan]] fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Arwen did not return his love.<ref name=""Tale"" /><ref name=""TA"" />

Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. Whether Arwen chose to marry him and become mortal, or remain with her kin as one of the Elves, she would be parted from either Elrond or Aragorn forever.<ref name=""Tale"" /> 
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Lord of Rivendell.jpg|left|thumb|Arwen in Rivendell, art by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]
It was not until they met many years later in Lórien that Arwen returned Aragorn's love, and in {{TA|2980}} they plighted their troth on [[Cerin Amroth]]. Aragorn gave her the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name=""Tale"" /><ref name=""TA"" />

In the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Misty Mountains]] and all lands eastward became dangerous, and at the request of her father, Arwen returned to Imladris in {{TA|3009}}.<ref name=""TA"" />
[[File:Janka Latečková - King and his Queen.jpg|thumb|right|''King and his Queen'' by Janka Latečková]]
Arwen was later reunited with Aragorn when he brought the [[Hobbits]] to [[Rivendell]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. She was present at a feast attended by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Later that night, she and Aragorn spoke together.<ref name=""Many"" /> When the Fellowship departed and [[Galadriel]] offered them [[Gifts of Galadriel|her gifts]], Arwen's Elfstone, given from Galadriel to Celebrían, and Celebrían to Arwen, was the gift for Aragorn. He would wear the Elfstone ever after.<ref name=""Farewell"">{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref>

Arwen wove the [[standard of Elendil]] for Aragorn from black cloth, decorating it with [[mithril]], gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of [[Rangers of the North]] to Aragorn before he took the [[Paths of the Dead]], thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> The banner was unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to triumphantly announce the King's return.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Wedding of the King.jpg|thumb|""The Wedding of [[Aragorn|the King]]"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
After the defeat of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West]] and the new [[Reunited Kingdom]]; [[1 May|on that day]] Arwen and her father departed for [[Minas Tirith]]. On [[20 May]] they reached Lothlórien where they stayed for [[27 May|a week]] before Arwen resumed with her escort. On [[14 June]] she met her brothers and together they went to [[Edoras]] where they stayed [[16 June|two days]] before continuing to Gondor.<ref name=""Chief"">{{App|Chief}}</ref> 
===Queen===
Arwen arrived to [[Minas Tirith]] on [[1 Lithe]] and wed Aragorn on [[Mid-year's Day]],<ref name=""Chief"" /> being the third [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]]. Arwen chose a fate different from her father's and did not sail to the [[Aman|West]]. Instead, she gifted Frodo, as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], passage in her stead, as she foresaw that his burden would not be lifted. She also gifted him a necklace with a white gem.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

As Queen of Gondor, Arwen maintained a close connection with Gondor's allies, as did her husband. In {{FoA|15}} they visited the [[Hobbits]] outside [[the Shire]] and she took as a maid of honour [[Elanor Gardner]], daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> She was mother of one son, [[Eldarion]], and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aragorn's death, Arwen departed from Minas Tirith and returned to the abandoned Lothlórien. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in {{FoA|121}} at [[Cerin Amroth]], and was buried there.<ref name=""Tale"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Arwen Undomiel.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Arwen''''' means ""Noble Maiden"" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[ara]]-'' (""noble"") and ''[[gwenn]]'' (""maiden"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 205</ref> Tolkien remarked that it also means ""greatly blessed"" in [[Welsh]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ""[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to S.E.O. Joukes, 28 August 1967]]""</ref>

The [[Quenya]] form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his Quenya greeting, Aragorn refers to her again as ""Arwen"" (''Arwen vanimelda, namárië!'').<ref name=""Farewell"" /> This suggests that the form ''Arwen'' itself is also coincidentally a valid, or at least understandable, Quenya calque (using ''[[ar]]-'', stem ''Arwend-'').  

==Other names==
Her [[epessë]], '''''[[Undómiel]]''''', means ""Evenstar"", from ''[[Undómë]]'' (""evening twilight"") and ''[[elen|el]]'' (""star"").

She is also given the names ''Elrenniel'' and ''Elerondiel'', both meaning ""Daughter of Elrond"" in Sindarin and Quenya respectively.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 56</ref>

==Genealogy==
Arwen was a very distant cousin of Aragorn. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the [[Half-elven]] were joined.<ref name=""Numenor"">{{App|A1i}}</ref> Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves as well as the only line with [[Maia]] blood through Arwen's great-great grandmother, [[Melian]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
While writing the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the character was named ''[[Finduilas]]''; only during the final proofreading in [[1949]] Tolkien changed the name to ''Arwen''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxviii</ref>

Tolkien considered to postpone the birth of Arwen from {{TA|241}} to {{TA|341}} , or even in {{TA|421}},<ref>{{NM|P1ix}}, p. 67.</ref> to increase the interval between the birth of the twins and the birth of Arwen where the parents were at rest, and he assigned the error in dates to a ""probable scribal origin"" (with the inversion of numbers 241/421).

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Arwen does not appear in this film.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Arwen is voiced by [[Sonia Fraser]].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the [[Council of Elrond]]. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the [[Riddle of Strider]]. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely [[Kath Soucie]].

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Arwen is played by [[Liv Tyler]]. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.

:In the first film, she rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was [[Glorfindel]] who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]],a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.

:There is a scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for [[Valinor]], and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.

:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Elrond takes the reforged [[Narsil]], now [[Andúril]], to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with [[the One Ring]], and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Elrond's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Ring, but that Arwen's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of Middle-earth, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Arwen is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of ''The Return of the King'', but is alluded to earlier.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from [[Rivendell]] into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for [[Aragorn]] and bid the player to deliver to [[Halbarad]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], her prominence increases as [[Elrond]] and his household travel to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding. On their way towards [[Lothlórien]] from the lands of the [[Beornings]], Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother [[Celebrian]] was tormented by [[orcs]] before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady [[Galadriel]].

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of [[Liv Tyler]], her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].

'''Bandobras ""the Bullroarer"" Took''' was the son of [[Thain]] [[Isumbras Took III|Isumbras III]] of the [[Took Family|Took]] line.<ref name=""Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref> He was distinguished by his great height (for a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]), being four foot five and thus able to ride a horse.<ref name=""Hobbits"">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

==History==
Bandobras was famous for averting a [[Orcs|goblin]] invasion of [[the Shire]] at the [[Battle of Greenfields]] of {{TA|2747}},<ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref> and personally slaying the goblins' king, [[Golfimbul]]. Bandobras took off the head of the goblin king with a wood club, causing it to fly through the air for 100 yards and fall down a rabbit hole; it is said that this is how the game of [[golf]] was invented.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

Nothing is known about Bandobras' family, other than he had ""many descendants"", some of whom were the [[North-took Family|North Tooks]] of [[Long Cleeve]].<ref name=""Took""/>

==Etymology==
Bandobras is a combination of the elements ''bando'' (""band"", ""stripe"", ""banner"") and ''bras'' (""arm"").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 191</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the alliteration between Bandobras and Bullroarer was significant and that translators should attempt to keep it.

Tolkien believed while writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'' that ""bullroarer"" was an instrument of primitive peoples that made a roaring sound, as named by anthropologists, though he could not find it in any dictionaries.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 764</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In editions prior to the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', the Prologue gave Bandobras' father as [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]]. This was based on an earlier version of the Took family tree,<ref>{{RS|3XIXc}}</ref> but was never corrected.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 6</ref>

==Inspirations==
It is possible [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by one George von Hohenzollern, who, like the Bullroarer to Bilbo, held the image of the bold ancestor to Tolkien:
{{Blockquote|He [the Bullroarer] charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul's head clean off with a wooden club.|""[[An Unexpected Party]]""<ref name=""Party""/>}}
{{Blockquote|She [Tolkien's aunt Grace] alleged that the family name [""Tolkien""] had originally been ""von Hohenzollern"", for they had emanated from the Hohenzollern district of the Holy Roman Empire. A certain George von Hohenzollern had, she said, fought on the side of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria at the Siege of Vienna in 1529. He had shown great daring in leading an unofficial raid against the Turks and capturing the Sultan’s standard. This (said Aunt Grace) was why he was given the nickname Tollkühn, ""foolhardy""; and the name stuck.|[[Humphrey Carpenter]]<ref>{{HM|Bio}}</ref>}}

===Films===
'''1966: ''[[The Hobbit]]'':'''
:Bandobras is briefly mentioned as Bilbo's ""great-great-grandhobbit"". In Bag End Bilbo has a drawing of Bandobras,sword upraised,standing triumphantly over the corpse of a wolf.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:In trying to convince [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] of his [[Tooks|Tookishness]], [[Gandalf]] talks about the story of Bandobras Took and his victory at the [[Battle of Greenfields]]. He also says that Bandobras invented the game of golf in his killing of [[Golfimbul]] but qualifies this by suggesting that it is an embellishment. The portrait was based on [[Dan Hennah]], the production designer for the films.

===Games===
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:The first Hobbit outside [[Bag End]] recounts the story of Bandobras, followed by the accusations that young hobbits do not know enough about their history.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The public test server is named Bullroarer after Bandobras Took.

:In [[Brockenborings]] there is a wooden statue depicting Bandobras just after he defeated Golfimbul. Every Spring [[the Shire]] celebrates Bullroarer Took Day when the Hobbits drink tankards of Bullroarer's Brew and also place tankards of the drink under his statue in his honor. Bullroarer's Brew was Bandobras' favorite drink and it was named after him. It is a beer brewed out of clovers.

:Besides inventing golf, Bandobras also invented fence walking. Every morning Bullroarer would drink his favorite beer and then walk across a fence. It is said that he did this to improve his balance. Hobbits would play fence walking as part of the Bullroarer Took Day celebration.

'''2014: ''[[Lego The Hobbit: The Video Game]]'''''
:Bandobras is an obtainable playable character.

==History==
Berilac was the son of [[Merimac Brandybuck]]. He was a guest at [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Berilac'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

A note in the [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (edition)|edition]] of the poem [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[E.V. Gordon]] mentions the name ''Bercilak de Hautdesert'' as the name of the [[Wikipedia:Green Knight|Green Knight]]. This mote also mentions that it is not clear if the fourth letter in the name of this character should be read as a ""c"" or a ""t"". The similar name ''Bertilak'' was used by J.R.R. Tolkien as the name of the Green Knight in his [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo|translation]] of the poem ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", ""The Celtic-sounding Names"", p. 201</ref>

'''Bill Butcher''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name=""Perry"">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Bill Butcher was accompanied by his dog [[Grip (Bill Butcher's dog)|Grip]] when he threw a knife upon seeing the [[Lonely Troll]] peeping over the stalls of the market-place.<ref name=""Perry"" />

It is possible that Bill Butcher may have been one of the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to [[Faraway]] in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll.<ref name=""Perry"" />

==Background==
In the first version of the poem in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was entitled ''The Bumpus'', the butcher was unnamed, ""threw his knives"", and had no dog.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> No changes to the character occurred in the second version on [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> in which Tolkien revised the poem as part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of his ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series. The third version also retained the same details in relation to the butcher.<ref name=commentary/>

In early [[1961]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> when Tolkien revised the poem for inclusion within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', the unnamed butcher was accompanied by his dog (instead of ""Harry and his father""), threw a single knife, and was given the name '''Bill butcher'''. In a later revision, Tolkien capitalized the word butcher in Bill's name<ref name=""Perry"" />.<ref name=collectedpoems/>

'''Bucca of the Marish''' was the first [[Thain]] of the [[Hobbits]] in [[Eriador]]. 

==History==
Around {{SR|379}}, some four years after the fall of the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]], the Hobbits of [[the Shire]] elected from their midst one Bucca of the [[Marish]] as the first Thain. He was to rule the land in the [[King of Arthedain|King]]'s stead. Little else is known about him, other than that he brought peace and prosperity to the Hobbits.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

His family became the [[Oldbucks]] and eventually the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]]. 

==Etymology==
The word '''Bucca''' is [[Old English]] for ""buck"", ""male deer"" or ""he-goat"" which is a translation of the original [[Westron]] name '''[[Gamba]]'''.<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>

'''Déagol''' was a [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of the [[Gladden Fields]] that found [[the One Ring]] and was murdered by [[Sméagol]].

One day Sméagol [[ribadyan|had his birthday]], Déagol gave a customary present (albeit begrudgingly, as he was a mean little soul),<ref name=L214/> which he claimed was more than what he could afford.<ref name=Shadow/> Later that day, though still very early in the morning, they went fishing in the [[Gladden Fields]] on a boat. When Sméagol took a break to nose about the banks, a great fish pulled Déagol to the bottom of the water. Upon seeing something gleaming in the river-bed, he abandoned his fishing equipment and seized the gleaming object. When he swam out, ''""with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud""'', he saw that what he discovered was a ''""[[the One Ring|beautiful golden ring]]""''.[[File:Cor Blok - Sméagol and Déagol.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|""[[Gollum|Sméagol]] and Déagol"" by [[Cor Blok]]]] Yet, as he gloated over his finding, Sméagol watched him from nearby and silently approached him, desiring the ring. Sméagol, being greedy, thought that Déagol's gift to him was poor and insufficient,<ref name=L214/> and thus used his birthday as an excuse to claim the ring; and as Déagol refused to hand it over, Sméagol strangled him, and hid his body cleverly so that the others didn't find it.<ref name=Shadow/>

In the years following the murder of Déagol, Sméagol became haunted by his actions, making up the defence that it was his birthday and that Déagol should have given it to him. After Sméagol became '''[[Gollum]]''', he repeated his defence over and over as he gnawed bones within darkness until he very nearly believed it himself.<ref name=Shadow/>

==Etymology==
''Déagol'' is a name that is based on the [[Old English]] word ''deagol (digol)'', which means ""secret"" or ""hidden"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 86</ref> It is a translation of the ""original"" [[Westron]] name ''[[Nahald]]'', which means ""secret"" in the Northern tongues of the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=Nahald/>

:Déagol appears in [[Prologue: A Ring's Tale|the Prologue]]. While fishing in the [[Anduin|Great River Anduin]] with [[Gollum|Sméagol]], he is pulled into the water by a large fish attatched to his rod. He lets go of his rod and spots [[The One Ring|a ring]] at the bottom. He takes it back to the surface and rubs it on his body, enamored by its beauty. Sméagol asks him for the Ring because ""its my birthday, my love, and I wants it"". Déagol tells him he has already given him more than he could afford and that he will keep the Ring because he found it. Gollum asks ""will you indeed, my love?"" and strangles Déagol to death, taking the ring for himself.

Tolkien added Estella to the family trees in Appendix C in the mid-1960s during the revisions that led to the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

'''Farmer Maggot''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] who at the time of the [[War of the Ring]] owned a farm called [[Bamfurlong]]<ref name=Boating>{{AB|Boating}}</ref> in the [[Marish]]<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 91</ref> in the [[Eastfarthing]]<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 6</ref> of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}, p. 9</ref>
 
==Character and appearance==
Farmer Maggot was broad, thickset with a round red face, a shrewd hobbit who was friendly to all [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] (and on friendly terms with [[Tom Bombadil]]<ref name=Boating/>). Living in the borderlands Maggot had to be more on his guard than most Hobbits and for protection he kept three huge dogs called [[Grip]], [[Fang (dog)|Fang]], and [[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]].<ref name=Mushrooms>{{FR|Mushrooms}}</ref>

Like most inhabitants of the Marish, which was fertile but boggy, the Maggots lived in a house instead of a [[Hobbit-holes|hobbit-hole]]. Maggot had a wife, at least two sons and three daughters, plus a few other hobbits working for him; around ten persons belonged to his family and farm-household.<ref name=Mushrooms/>

Like many other Marish-ers, Maggot felt closer to the [[Bucklanders]] such as the [[Brandybucks]], and considered other [[Shire-hobbits]] alien and queer; when he heard that young [[Frodo Baggins]] had left Buckland for [[Hobbiton]], he thought it would not be good for him.<ref name=Mushrooms/>

==History==
When [[Frodo Baggins]] was young he lived in [[Brandy Hall]] and used to sneak into Farmer Maggot's fields to steal [[mushrooms]].  After catching Frodo thieving several times, Maggot finally beat the young mushroom poacher and let him to his dogs, who chased Frodo all the way to the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].  Frodo remained terrified of the old farmer and his dogs thereafter. However he was a good friend with Frodo's cousin, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who used to visit him with [[Peregrin Took]]. When he heard that Frodo had left to live with the queer folk of [[Hobbiton]], he was worried about him.<ref name=Mushrooms/>
 [[File:Lissanne Lake - Farmer Maggot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Maggot and the [[Nazgûl]] - Illustration by [[Lissanne Lake]]]]
On [[25 September]] of {{TA|3018}}, when a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] approached Maggot his dog [[Grip]] yelped and ran off howling with its tail put down. When the rider asked him if he has seen ''[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]'', Maggot told him to leave, that there were no Bagginses here and recommended him to go back to [[Hobbiton]]. The rider said that Baggins had left and that he would come back and reward Maggot with gold if he informed him the next time that Baggins came. Maggot however, despite the chill this stranger caused him, told the rider to leave and not to come back and threatened him to call his dogs. The Black Rider sort of hissed, Maggot did not know if he was laughing or not, and spurred his horse at him, but Maggot jumped out of the way. Maggot called his dogs, but the rider turned around and rode away.<ref name=Mushrooms/>
 
Later that day Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and Pippin came to Maggot's farm, and extra-cautious Maggot was ready to unleash his dogs this time if he didn't recognise his old friend Pippin, and also Frodo. After [[Mrs. Maggot]] served the travelers mugs of beer, Maggot related his story about the stranger. Maggot speculated that some strangers might want to know what happened to the gold and jewels that was said to have been acquired by [[Bilbo Baggins]] in some strange way in [[Lonely Mountain|foreign parts]]. He remembered Frodo as a member of the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck family]] who had trespassed on his land to collect mushrooms when he was young and expressed his happiness for returning from the queer folk in Hobbiton to the East where he belongs. Frodo thanked the farmer for his hospitality and refused his invitation for dinner, as they had to hurry along, but Maggot offered to take them by wagon to the Ferry thereafter. The invitation was gratefully accepted.<ref name=Mushrooms/>
 
In the night Maggot and his passengers headed for the Ferry, and they encountered Merry looking for them.  Upon reaching their destination, Maggot set out for home after giving Frodo a gift from Mrs Maggot. The gift was a basket of mushrooms.<ref name=Mushrooms/>

==Etymology==
Tolkien says that the name ""Maggot"" was a ""meaningless"" [[Hobbitish]] name. ''Maggot'' should not be understood as the English word [[Wikipedia:maggot|maggot]], which means a grub or larva. The similarity is coincidental.<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Maggot''', p. 760</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first phase of writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the visit to Farmer Maggot was roughly the same as the final version, but in a much abbreviated form.  Bingo (who would later be named Frodo Baggins) had never stolen mushrooms from Bamfurlong.  The farmer had only one small dog named Gip and while he had a wife, no children or other members of the household were mentioned.  At the first sight of the dog, Bingo put on his [[The One Ring|Ring]] and stayed invisible during the visit.  Odo and Frodo Took (who were later changed into Pippin and Sam) enjoyed a beer while Maggot told them of the visit by the Black Rider.  At the end of the story invisible Bingo lifted Maggot's mug and drank his beer, scaring the old farmer who was glad to see the two (visible) hobbits run away.  The hobbits did not get a wagon ride to the Ferry nor did they receive any mushrooms.<ref>{{RS|Maggot}}</ref>
 
When [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] came to write about [[Tom Bombadil]] he toyed with the idea of making Farmer Maggot some other creature than a hobbit, possibly akin to Tom himself.<ref>{{RS|Tom}}</ref> As this notion brewed a line was given to Frodo Took stating that Maggot was ""not a hobbit – not a pure hobbit anyway"" and that he had hair under his chin.<ref>{{RS|1VIN}}, note 7</ref>
 
Farmer Maggot changed considerably in the second phase of writing the story, although he was still a hobbit. Now the One Ring was much more dangerous and Bingo was not supposed to wear it frivolously. However, Tolkien still wanted to retain the mysteriously levitating beer mug incident, which meant that Bingo had to wear the Ring in Maggot's house.  To justify this the visit to Bamfurlong took on a much darker hue.  Young Bingo used to steal mushrooms.  One day, in fear of being mauled, he threw a rock at one of the farmer's dogs and killed it.  Maggot beat Bingo and told him he would kill him the next time he trespassed, and would have killed him then if Bingo had not belonged to a rich and powerful family. When the hobbits approached the farm, terrified Bingo slipped on the Ring. Inside the house Maggot emphasized his unrelenting hostility toward all Bagginses.  Bingo pulls the floating beer mug trick but then berates the bewildered farmer, pushes him into the fire-irons, and makes his hat sail out of the house.
 
[[Christopher Tolkien]] commented that the difficulty of keeping the Ring secret eventually killed this version. When the story was rewritten again to make Maggot a shrewd but kindly soul the last of the lighthearted tricks with the Ring was removed from the developing story.<ref>{{RS|Short}}</ref>
 
In yet another version of the beginning Farmer Maggot's hostility, it was [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Bingo who stumbled onto Maggot's farm one foggy evening.  They accidentally got into his garden and Maggot set a great wolf-like dog upon them.  Bilbo broke the dog's head to save Bingo from a mauling and Maggot flung Bilbo into a ditch. Maggot threatened to kill Bingo, Bilbo threatened to come back armed, and Maggot said he had a weapon or two himself.<ref>{{RS|2XVIIN}}, note 6</ref>

<center>{{quote|You would have done better to come with us after all, poor old Fredegar!|[[Peregrin Took]]<ref name=""Havens"">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>}}</center>
'''Fredegar ""Fatty"" Bolger''' was a Hobbit of [[the Shire]]. He was one of the close friends of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] who knew that he had the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and helped him with his mission to leave the Shire. 
==History==
===Ancestry===
Fatty was a descendant of [[Hildibrand Took]] ({{TA|2849}} - {{TA|2934}}), one of the many sons of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name=took>{{App|Took}}</ref> He was the son of [[Odovacar Bolger]] and [[Rosamunda Took]]. Fatty was born in {{TA|2980}} and his family was from [[Budgeford]] in [[Bridgefields]] of the [[Eastfarthing]]. He also had a younger sister, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella Bolger]] (b. {{TA|2985}}), who would eventually marry [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]. 

Fredegar was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]]. In {{TA|3001}} he was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name=took/>

===Conspiracy===
Fatty was one of the [[Conspirators]], the friends of Frodo who knew that he was in an important mission to leave the Shire, and they assisted him without his knowledge. Fatty, along with [[Folco Boffin]] and Frodo's close circle, in [[September]] {{TA|3018}} helped him pack and send his things to [[Crickhollow]], and stayed to celebrate his last [[22 September|birthday]] before his departure from [[Hobbiton]]; Fatty and Merry left [[23 September|the next morning]] for the house that Frodo had bought, in order to prepare it to be ready and habitable for his arrival.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> 

Frodo eventually came to his house, along with [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. It was there when the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo, and expressed their will to follow him in his mission. Fatty however was a typical hobbit who had never left the Shire and was unwilling to do so, but would play his role; he stayed behind to keep up the pretence that Frodo was there, by wearing his clothes and keep the house occupied, and deal with any ""inquisitive folk"". 

After hearing that Frodo was pursued by the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], Fatty was given the option to flee with the others into the [[Old Forest]], but that didn't seem any more inviting to him despite Merry's attempts to persuade him that the Riders were far more terrifying than the stories about the Old Forest. Fredegar opted to remain behind as a decoy for the Nazgûl and as a messenger for [[Gandalf]] in case he showed up.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>
[[File:Christina Wald - Fatty Bolger.jpg|thumb|left|Christina Wald - ''Fatty Bolger'']]
The Ringwraiths did eventually come in the night of [[30 September]] to Crickhollow for Frodo and [[the One Ring|the Ring]]. But Fatty, though frightened nearly witless, escaped to raise the alarm of [[Buckland]], causing the [[Brandybucks]] to sound the [[Horn-call of Buckland]]. This caused the Nazgûl to flee, but they had learned that the Ring was gone.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

===Resistance===
During [[Saruman]]'s rule of [[the Shire]], Fatty led a group of partisans fighting against the [[Ruffians]] in the [[Brockenbores]] around the hills of [[Scary]] before eventually being captured. He was imprisoned in the [[Lockholes]] and starved, (and could no longer be called ""Fatty"") but was rescued after the victory of the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref name=""Havens""/>

==Etymology==
The name contains ''ferdi'' ""peace"" and ''gar'' ""spear"".<ref>[[An Introduction to Elvish]], ""Giving of Names""</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of the text (cf. ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''), his name was '''Hamilcar Bolger''' and was rescued by [[Gandalf]] from [[Black Riders]] before reaching [[Rivendell]], narrating to the protagonists Gandalf's adventures. His larger role was later abandoned.<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiii</ref>

His role survives as a minor anomaly in the published ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' - before the four Hobbits go into the [[Old Forest]], they have ''six'' ponies prepared (Fatty was originally supposed to go with them). The number was corrected to ''five'' in the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}, ""Note"", p. xvii</ref>

'''Gerontius Took''' ({{SR|1190}} - {{SR|1320|n}}, died aged 130), also known as '''The Old Took''', was a renowned [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] and twenty-sixth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Gerontius was the only son of [[Fortinbras Took I|Fortinbras I]]. He married [[Adamanta Chubb]], who gave birth to twelve children: [[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]], [[Hildigard Took|Hildigard]], [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]], [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]], [[Isembold Took|Isembold]], [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]], [[Isembard Took|Isembard]], [[Hildibrand Took|Hildibrand]], [[Belladonna Took|Belladonna]], [[Donnamira Took|Donnamira]], [[Mirabella Took|Mirabella]] and [[Isengar Took|Isengar]].

After the death of his father in {{SR|1248|n}}, Gerontius became the twenty-sixth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> He was a friend of [[Gandalf]], who gave him a pair of magic diamond studs<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> and performed firework tricks during Gerontius' [[Mid-year's Day|midsummer]]-eve parties.<ref>{{H|6}}</ref><ref group=""note"">Midsummer-eve obviously refers to 1 [[Lithe]].</ref>

Gerontius Took reached the impressive age of 130, which made him the oldest [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] until his grandson [[Bilbo Baggins]] celebrated his 131st Birthday.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> He also held the record of most offspring, until [[Samwise Gamgee]] bested him with [[Tolman Gardner|Tom]]'s birth in {{SR|1442}}.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

==Etymology==
He was called ''The Old Took'' not because of his age, but because of his numerous younger relatives.<ref name=""RC"">{{HM|RC}}, p. 54</ref>

''[[Wikipedia:Gerontius|Gerontius]]'' is a Latin name, which means ""Old-man"". It is derived from Greek ''Geróntios''. The element ''géron'' is Greek for ""old"". ''Gerontius'' was a popular name in the Late Roman Empire and is rendered as ''[[Wikipedia:Geraint|Geraint]]'' in [[Welsh]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 191</ref> ''Geraint'' is found as a royal name in ''The [[Wikipedia:Mabinogion|Mabinogion]]'' and in Tennyson's ''[[Wikipedia:Geraint and Enid#Geraint and Enid|Geraint and Enid]]''.<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], [[Tolkien and Welsh]], p. 133</ref>

''Gerontius'' is one of the very few Greco-Latin names appearing in Hobbit lore.

==Inspiration==
In [[Letter to Mr and Mrs Kloos|a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Kloos]], Tolkien stated that when he wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he had imagined Bilbo's grandfather to be old, because both of his grandparents were around a hundred years old when they died.<ref name=""RC""/>

'''Gollum''', also known as '''Sméagol''', was a creature (originally a [[Stoors|Stoorish]] [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]) who bore [[the One Ring]]. He lived in the [[Misty Mountains]] for most of his life. In {{TA|2941}} he lost the Ring to [[Bilbo Baggins]]. For the rest of his life he sought to recover his ""precious"" ""birthday present"". In {{TA|3019}} he followed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and met [[Frodo Baggins]]. After leading Frodo into [[Mordor]] and betraying him to [[Shelob]] he finally seized the Ring in [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]]. In his euphoria he died and destroyed the Ring after falling into the fires of [[Mount Doom]].

==History==
===Early life===
Sméagol was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of riverland [[Stoors|Stoor-kind]] who lived on the banks of the [[Anduin]] in the later [[Third Age]]. Sméagol belonged to the reputable family of the stern and wise matriarch.<ref name=shadow/> He spent the early years of his life living with his extended family during the [[Watchful Peace]], when [[Sauron]] was in the [[East]].<ref name=ta/> 

He had some amount of education in lore, as during his youth he had learned of the events concerning the [[War of the Last Alliance]] against [[Sauron]].<ref name=Passage>{{TT|IV2}}</ref> He also knew the [[riddle-game]], and riddles that were known to their cousins in [[the Shire]].<ref name=shadow/><ref name=riddles>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Sméagol and the Ring.jpg|left|thumb|''Sméagol and the Ring'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]

Around the year {{TA|2463}}, on his birthday, his friend (and close relative) [[Déagol]] offered him a cheap present.<ref name=L214>{{L|214}}</ref> Later that day they went boating in the [[Gladden Fields]], and as Sméagol was nosing at the banks, Déagol was pulled into the water by a large fish, and found a gold ring. Sméagol demanded the ring as a birthday present and strangled Deágol when he refused, and hid his body.<ref name=shadow/> Sméagol became the fourth [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] after Sauron, [[Isildur]], and [[Déagol]].<ref name=ta>{{app|TA}}</ref>

After this event, he returned home and understood he was invisible. He kept his treasure a secret and used it in malicious ways, to see and hear secrets and hurtful things. and was corrupted further by the ring. Soon he became unpopular and his peers avoided him; they often cursed and kicked him, and he bit their feet. Becoming a loner, he muttered to himself and gurgled in his throat, for which they called him ''gollum'', and he survived by stealing. Eventually even his grandmother, desiring peace, banished him from their family and [[hobbit-hole]].<ref name=shadow/>

Sad for the hard world, he wandered in loneliness up the River, and followed a stream. He spent time by some deep pools, aided by the invisibility of the Ring, he caught fish which he ate raw. [[Third Age 2470|Some time later]]<ref name=ta/> eventually forgotten by him, the [[Sun]] started to scorch his skin and eyes, and as he looked up he noticed the [[Misty Mountains]] from which the stream ran down. He decided to go there, in the desirable darkness, safe from the scorching sun, with more ""roots"" and secrets to discover there. Indeed, by night he climbed up the highlands, and wormed into the little cave out of which the stream flowed.<ref name=shadow/>

The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body and mind and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. The murder of Déagol haunted him, and as a psychological defence he repeated to it (as he talked to it) that it turned up to him so as to be his ""Birthday Present"" and his ""[[precious]]"".<ref name=shadow/>

[[File:Michael Hague - Riddles in the Dark.jpg|thumb|right|''Riddles in the Dark'' by [[Michael Hague]]]]

Gollum lived longer than any other Hobbit could, and for over four hundred years he managed to live on a small island surrounded by a subterranean [[Gollum's lake|lake]]. He preyed upon any raw [[fish]] that he caught from his small raft, though sometimes he manages to catch [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Goblins]] from the nearby [[Goblin-town]]. In later years he found Hobbit and [[Elves|Elven]] food repulsive. The Ring's corrupting influence as well as centuries of isolation in the Misty Mountains took a deep toll on him both physically and mentally. He became disfigured and grotesque in appearance, and by the time he met the Hobbit [[Bilbo Baggins]] he was afflicted with almost complete madness.

===Departure of the Ring===
In July {{TA|2941}}, during the [[Quest of Erebor]], Bilbo stumbled upon Gollum's lake and found the Ring. Gollum had lost the Ring in the network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more proper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a will of its own. As [[Gandalf]] said later, the [[Necromancer]] was becoming more powerful, and it was a good time for the Ring to change hands and get back to Sauron.<ref name=shadow/> 

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gollum is Defeated.jpg|thumb|left|''Gollum is Defeated'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

While he was unaware of his loss, he met [[Bilbo Baggins]] who was lost, and it's possible that Gollum's own part of his mind was pleased to hear again a kindly voice that reminded him of the outside world, but this also made his evil part angrier.<ref name=shadow/>

After the famous [[Riddle-game]], Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way out and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his ""''birthday present''"", however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realised the answer to Bilbo's last riddle - ""''What have I got in my pocket?''"" - and became furious. Bilbo inadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he ran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the entrance of the cave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome with pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried out, ""''Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!''""<ref>{{FR|Ring}}</ref>

===Into the wild===
He stayed two more years in the Mountains although he was disgusted by the empty night, nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He hated darkness, light and the Ring most of all, but his addiction to it was so great that he overcame his hatred and fear of the light and the Orcs. He left and pursued Bilbo,<ref name=shadow/><ref name=ta/> but the trail was cold. 

Hiding from the Sun and [[Moon]], quickly and silently he moved by night, hunting small creatures. As the Ring was no longer devouring him, he was a bit revived, and new food and air made him stronger. He followed Bilbo's trail through [[Mirkwood]] and even reached [[Esgaroth]] and [[Dale]]. Spying on the [[Men of Dale]] he learned more about the thief and [[the Shire|where he was from]]. Then apparently he decided to turn back and go [[Eriador|West]] to find the thief, again through Mirkwood. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]], apparently cooperating with [[Gandalf]], tracked him. His presence terrified the beasts and birds, as he ate eggs and the young animals from nests and holes, even broke into houses and approached cradles of the babies of the [[Woodmen]], who spoke about a blood-drinking ghost, until he reached again the Great River; then for some reason, as the Wood-elves say, he turned southwards and his traces were lost. And then Gandalf neglected the matter because he had much else to think at that time, which was a great mistake because it was the year [[Third Age 2951|when]] [[Sauron]] declared himself openly, and Gollum turned towards [[Mordor]].<ref name=shadow/><ref name=ta/>

[[Third Age 2980|Thirty years later]] he reached the confines of Mordor, and met [[Shelob]], who would help him take his revenge. As he ventured into Mordor he was captured by Sauron and for the next years he was forced to reveal what he knew about the Ring.<ref name=ta/> Thus Sauron's spies learned from him that the One Ring was found, and the names ""[[The Shire|Shire]]"" and ""hobbits"". Meanwhile ({{TA|3001|n}}) Gandalf suspected that Bilbo's Ring was one of the [[Rings of Power]] and changed his plans to resume his search for Gollum, but that was in vain as his tracks had been too old now,<ref name=shadow/> and Gollum was in Mordor. By {{TA|3017}} Gollum was set free, only to be caught at last by [[Aragorn]] at the skirts of the [[Dead Marshes]]. After many perils Aragorn led and turned him over to [[Gandalf]].<ref name=shadow/><ref name=ta/> Gollum whined and cringed and licked his wounded hands and fingers.<ref name=shadow/>

[[File:Inger Edelfeldt - Gollum Held Captive by the Elves.jpg|thumb|right|''Gollum Held Captive by the Elves'' by [[Inger Edelfeldt]]]]

The [[Wizards|Wizard]] attempted to interrogate him and among Gollum's growling, snorting, curses and lies (he talked about his ""birthday present"", which his grandmother gave him among her [[Rings of Power|magic rings]]) Gandalf endured many weary days. He had to threaten him with fire, and managed to learn of the story he didn't know bit by bit, but Gollum didn't say much after the departure of Bilbo as he feared Mordor more. Gollum felt misunderstood and ill-treated, exiled into a hole and then ""robbed""; and spoke about revenge, thanks to his new friends.<ref name=shadow/> Gandalf placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves]] living in [[Thranduil]]'s [[Woodland Realm]] of [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=b3>{{App|B3}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
In June of {{TA|3018}}, Orcs raided the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] (in an obviously coordinated attack) allowing Gollum to escape. He resumed his search of the Ring and presumably, he decided to hide into [[Moria]] in [[August]], in order to lose his pursuers, the [[Elves]] and the servants of [[Sauron]]. However he could not open the [[Doors of Durin]] from the inside so didn't exit into [[Eriador]] to reach [[the Shire]].<ref name=b3/>

Presumably he stayed there for months, until  the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] entered Moria from the Door on [[13 January]] of [[Third Age 3019|the next year]], and Gollum picked up the trail of the new [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], [[Frodo Baggins]], as they travelled through Moria.<ref name=b3/> [[January|Two days later]] Gandalf was lost while fighting a [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] and breaking the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]; it is unknown how he crossed the chasm or the Bridge, but he came with them to [[Lothlórien]] without their knowing. Hiding somewhere around the shores of [[Anduin]], Gollum spied their departure,<ref name=b3/> and floating on a log, followed their boats down Anduin to [[Rauros]]. 

He pursued [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] across the [[Emyn Muil]] when they struck out on their own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a confrontation in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam, Frodo subdued him. Frodo tied an [[Elves|Elvish]] rope around Gollum's ankle for a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the ""Precious"" itself, and Frodo released him. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the [[Black Gate]], the entrance to Mordor.

Frodo's kindness brought out the ""Sméagol"" personality, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of bond from both having been Ringbearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his possible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself. Gollum also feared Frodo, and also thought that helping him would deprive Sauron of the Ring.

When the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum convinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and Sauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south, where he knew of another entrance into Mordor.

Frodo and Sam were caught by [[Faramir]], and Gollum followed them, getting caught in the [[Forbidden Pool]] beneath [[Henneth Annûn]]. When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Sméagol prisoner, however, he felt betrayed, allowing the ""Gollum"" personality to take control. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was called [[Cirith Ungol]]. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gollum at the Forbidden Pool.jpg|thumb|''Gollum at the Forbidden Pool'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the pass of Cirith Ungol in the border-mountains of the [[Ephel Dúath]]. On [[11 March]] Gollum visited the great spider [[Shelob]], because he was planning to betray the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself. When he returned the Hobbits were asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum, and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Shelob's Lair]]. For this service to Shelob, the Orcs of Cirith Ungol knew Gollum as ""Her Sneak"".

Just as Frodo warned him, Gollum's betrayal of his oath ultimately led to his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from Shelob's lair and came against all odds to the volcano [[Mount Doom]]. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten creature.

Moments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the [[Cracks of Doom]], but, unwilling to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then Gollum attacked again. The two fought whilst Frodo was invisible and finally Gollum bit off Frodo's finger.

Here Frodo's kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, for Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, taking the Ring and finger with him with a last cry of ""Preciouss!"". Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there would have been a good chance that Sauron would have regained the Ring, as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put the Ring on.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - The Stairs of Cirith Ungol.jpg|left|thumb|''The Stairs of Cirith Ungol'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Sméagol was a Hobbit, but he spent long centuries in darkness and damp, influenced by the power of the Ring. It is possible that thanks to his hardy Hobbitish nature that he was not reduced to a [[Wraiths|wraith]].<ref>
{{webcite|author=Stan Brown|website=FAQ of the Rings|articleurl=http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q1-GollumWraith|articlename=Why hadn’t Gollum turned into a wraith long ago?}}</ref> However, he was reduced to a small, extremely thin and wiry person, with scrawny neck, pale skin, flat feet, long thin hands with clammy fingers, and large pale or green eyes that seemed to glow. His sense of sight, as well as his hearing and smelling, was very good, due to the time he spent underground.

He could move and climb silently like a spider, and although he had only six teeth left,<ref>{{H|5}}</ref> he could give deep bites, even able to bite off Frodo's finger.

===Personality===
Sméagol was quick and strong, the most inquisitive and curious-minded of his community. He was interested in roots and beginnings. He owed [[#Etymology|his name]] to his interest in roots and deep pools; he dove, burrowed and tunnelled under trees, plants, and mounds. He tended to neglect anything that was higher, like the flowers, the trees and looking at the hills.<ref name=shadow/>

During his centuries of loneliness and under the Ring's influence, he seems to have developed something similar to a personality disorder: his ""Gollum"" personality was a slave to the Ring and would kill for it, overwhelming his former self, who still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love. Not having anyone else to speak to, he often quarreled with himself. Gollum both loved and hated the Ring and himself. He often referred both to the Ring and himself as ""my Precious"", perhaps confusing the two entities.<ref name=guide/>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Endgame on the Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|''Endgame on the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Years later, [[Samwise Gamgee]] would give two nickname to Gollum. Originally, Sam used the name Slinker to refer to Gollum's slinking around before they had captured him.<ref>{{TT|Taming}}, p. 604</ref> He then came to use Slinker and Stinker to refer to the two contrasting sides of Gollum's personality,<ref name=gate/> caused by possession of the [[One Ring]] for so long.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, pp. 53-5</ref> Slinker was the fawning, desperate, and eager-to-please, ""Sméagol"" side demeanour; and Stinker was the plotting and sinister ""Gollum"" side of him.<ref name=gate>{{TT|Gate}}, p. 638</ref> When he first came into the service of [[Frodo Baggins]] his Slinker side was more prominent but the closer they got to the [[Black Gate]] the more the Stinker side started to take over and Slinker became more like Stinker and Sam started using the name to generally refer to Gollum.<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 714</ref>

Other aspects of the Ring's corruption was the aversion to all living creatures, especially the [[Elves]] and all things Elven. The [[Elven rope]] burnt his skin, and [[lembas]] tasted like dust to him and choked him.

Sméagol, as a Hobbit, was perhaps good at heart, but he was relatively greedy and mean.<ref name=L214/> Bilbo was corrupted far more slowly by the Ring because his adventures with it began with an act of mercy, while Gollum began his with murder.<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Turner Mohan - The Ringbearers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Ringbearers'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]

''Sméagol'' is the translation of an actual [[Westron]] name ''[[Trahald]]'', the meaning of which was ""burrowing, worming in"" or ""apt to creep into a hole"". In both [[Westron]] and Old English, Sméagol's name is related to [[Smaug]]'s: Smaug's name in ""true [[language of Dale|Dalish]]""{{Fact}} was ''[[Trāgu]]'', and the ''Trah-'' stem in ''Trahald'' and ''Trâgu'' is thus an analogue of the Germanic stem present in both ''Sméagol'' and ''Smaug''.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explained in his ""[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]"" the origin of the name ''Sméagol'' in the lemma on [[smials]]:
{{blockquote|'''Smials'''. A word peculiar to hobbits (not Common Speech), meaning 'burrow'; leave unchanged. It is a form that the Old English word '''smygel''' 'burrow' might have had, if it had survived. The same element appears in Gollum's real name, '''Sméagol'''.}}

The name ''[[Smaug]]'', which means ""squeezed through a hole"", is thus related.<ref>{{L|31}}</ref>

===Pronunciation===
{{Pronounce|Anglo-Saxon - Sméagol.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
In both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in Peter Jackson's films ''Sméagol'' is pronounced as ""SMEE-gol"", although the placement of the acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is ""SMAY-uh-gol"". On the other hand, in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s recordings of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' he also pronounced it ""SMEE-gol"" or ""SMEE-AH-GOL"", suggesting that ''éa'' should either be pronounced as a long ""i""-sound or as a diphthong ''ea'', and not as two distinct vowels ""e"" and ""a"".<ref>{{webcite|author=J.R.R. Tolkien|website=J.R.R. Tolkien reads from 'The Lord of the Rings' #1|articleurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBQJTaMMMhI&feature=youtu.be&t=95|articlename=J.R.R. Tolkien reads from 'The Lord of the Rings' #1}}</ref> Tolkien had a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can also be seen in the name ''[[Eärendil]]'', which also occurs spelt ''Ëarendil''.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Gollum did not appear quite as wretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterisation to fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien then explained the version given in the first edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref name=""Christensen"">[[Bonniejean Christensen]], [[Jared Lobdell]] (ed.), ""Gollum's Character Transformation in ''The Hobbit''"", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', pages 7-26</ref>

In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', it is mentioned that [[the One Ring]] was found ""''ere the Kings failed in Gondor''"". This can mean that originally, Gollum's age was intended to be considerably more than six hundred years (further reinforced by certain places in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' like Gollum referring to tales about an uncorrupted [[Minas Ithil]] or Gandalf comparing his people to ""fathers of the fathers of the [[Stoors]]""). In fact it seems likely that Sauron leaving the Mirkwood in 2063 T.A. and some Hobbits settling there after that are details added for the purpose of making the smaller age possible; perhaps in order to make it possible for Gollum and the other characters to have the same language.

==Inspiration==
[[John Garth]] has suggested that the character of Gollum carries echoes of the ""''night-haunting, man-eating''"" [[Ogres|ogre]] [[Wikipedia:Grendel|Grendel]] in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John Garth]]|articleurl=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/05/j-r-r-tolkien-beowulf-one-mans-passion-threshold-between-myth-and-reality|articlename=J R R Tolkien's Beowulf: one man's passion for the threshold between myth and reality|dated=29 May 2014|website=[http://www.newstatesman.com/ newstatesman.com]|accessed=29 May 2014}}</ref>

===Films===
'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Gollum is a frog-like green creature, voiced by [[Theodore Isidore Gottlieb|Brother Theodore]]. Here, his ""Gollum"" noise sounds like muttering instead of swallowing.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Gollum is depicted as a skinny, dark grey creature, voiced by [[Peter Woodthorpe]]. 

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Brother Theodore reprised his role from the earlier [[Rankin/Bass]] production. Some footage from ''The Hobbit'' was reused to introduce the viewer to the story. 

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Gollum is a CGI-motion capture creature voiced by actor [[Andy Serkis]]. He is barely glimpsed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', where he is voiced by [[Dominic Monaghan]] in absence of Serkis.{{Fact}} Gollum becomes a central character in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''. The ground-breaking CGI character was built around Serkis's voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion capture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the digital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of digitally ""painting out"" Serkis's image and replacing it with Gollum's. In one such shot in ''The Two Towers'', Serkis' real spittle can be seen emerging from Gollum's mouth.

:In ''The Return of the King'' Serkis himself appears in a flashback scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'' but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'.

'''Gorbadoc ""Broadbelt"" Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Buckland]], [[Master of Buckland]] and grandfather of [[Frodo Baggins]]. 

==History==
Gorbadoc was the son of [[Marmadoc Brandybuck]] and after his father's death in {{SR|1310}}, he became [[Master of Buckland]].

He married [[Mirabella Took]], and had in all seven children: [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac]], [[Amaranth Brandybuck|Amaranth]], [[Saradas Brandybuck|Saradas]], [[Dodinas Brandybuck|Dodinas]], [[Asphodel Brandybuck|Asphodel]], [[Dinodas Brandybuck|Dinodas]] and [[Primula Brandybuck|Primula]].<ref name=tree>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

According to [[Hamfast Gamgee]], Gorbadoc was generous and his son-in-law [[Drogo Baggins]] enjoyed visiting [[Brandy Hall]] for his rich table,<ref name=party/> at least until Gorbadoc's death in {{SR|1363}}.<ref name=tree/> But according to Hamfast it was during one of his visits to him when he and his wife Primula were drowned in {{SR|1380}}.<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref> In reality Gorbadoc had been dead by then.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Gorbadoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggested that the [[Celtic]]-sounding name ''Gorbadoc'' is ""a slight alteration of ''[[Wikipedia:Gorboduc|Gorboduc]]'' or ''Gorbodugu''"", a fictional pre-Roman king of the Britons in [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 202</ref>

His name 'Broadbelt' derives from his generous table and waistline.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 171</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier manuscript versions of the chapter ''[[An Unexpected Party]]'', the grandfather of Bingo Baggins who was later renamed Frodo Baggins was called ''Gorboduc Brandybuck'',<ref>{{RS|1Iiv}}, p. 37</ref><ref>{{RS|Return}}, p. 234</ref><ref>{{RS|3XIXc}}, pp. 317</ref> and a friend of Bilbo was called ''Gorboduc Grubb''<ref>{{RS|1Ii}}, p. 15</ref><ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, p. 32</ref>.

Gobadoc Brandybuck was called ''Gorboduc Brandybuck'' in the first four versions of the family tree of the Brandybuck family and in the first three versions of the family tree of the Took family. In the fifth version of the Brandybuck familiy tree and in the fourth versions of the Took familiy tree his first name was changed to ''Gormanac'' and then to ''Gorbadoc''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript BR 1</ref><ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript BR 5</ref><ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript T 4</ref>.

''[[Brandagamba]]''<ref name=""Translation"" />).<ref name=""Conspiracy"" /> He ruled the land as [[Master of Buckland]]<ref name=""Translation"" /> and Master of the Hall, virtually a small independent country.<ref name=""Conspiracy"" /> After his death, the head of the Brandybuck family became the Master of Buckland<ref>{{App|Later}}, entry for the year 1432, p. 1097</ref> and Master of the Hall.<ref name=""Conspiracy"" /> When he and his family moved from [[the Shire]] to Buckland,<ref name=""TA2340"" /> the office of [[Thain]] passed from the Oldbuck family to the [[Took Family]]<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}, p. 9</ref> and [[Isumbras Took I]] became the first [[Thain]] of the Tooks<ref name=""TA2340"" />.

''Gorhendad'' is the translation of [[Westron]] ''Ogmandab''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 8</ref>. According to Stoor tradition, it used to mean ""great-grandfather"" or ""ancestor"".<ref name=""granddad"">{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F 4, text 'A' of the second section</ref>

In an earlier manuscript version the Westron name was ''Ogforgad''.<ref name=""granddad"" />

J.R.R.

{{quote|No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[A Long-expected Party]]""}}</center>
'''Hamfast Gamgee''', also known as '''the Gaffer''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], and the father of [[Samwise Gamgee]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He was the gardener of [[Bag End]] before he passed the title onto Sam.
==History==

Hamfast was born in {{TA|2926}}, the third son of [[Hobson|Hobson Gamgee]], who was a roper by trade. He had three siblings: [[Andwise Roper]], [[May (hobbit)|May]] and [[Halfred of Overhill]].<ref name=""Gamgee"">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

He entered the service of his relative, ""[[Holman Greenhand|Cousin Holman]]"", and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of [[Bag End]].<ref name=party/> On [[22 June]], {{TA|2942}}, he and Holman frantically tried to keep the garden in order during the auction of the presumed-dead [[Bilbo Baggins]]. 

Hamfast resided in Number 3, [[Bagshot Row]] and [[Daddy Twofoot]] was his next-door neighbor<ref name=party/> and had never been as far as [[Bucklebury]].<ref name=three/>

Hamfast became a gardener in his own right in about {{TA|2961}}, and a local expert on [[potatoes]] and other roots; ""Master Hamfast"" (as Bilbo called him) appreciated Bilbo's politeness and respecting his knowledge.<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref> He married [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]], and they had six children: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], Samwise and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]].<ref name=""Gamgee""/> Sam became Hamfast's apprentice.

Sam took over most of his father's work, who had become too old for the laborous work.<ref name=party/> He became known as the ""Gaffer"", a name Sam uses more often than ""Hamfast"".

Prior to the [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]], the younger [[hobbits]] sought information about the legendary Mr. Bilbo Baggins at the ''[[Ivy Bush]]''. Always a man of loquacity and knowledge, he argued with [[Sandyman]], [[Old Noakes]] and Daddy Twofoot about the [[Baggins Family|Bagginses]] and the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]]. After the party, Bilbo left him two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woolen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment as he suffered from creaking joints.<ref name=party/> By {{TA|3018}} he also began to lose his sight.<ref name=three/>

In {{TA|3018}}, his new neighbor, [[Frodo Baggins]] decided to leave the Shire, and [[Gandalf]] had obliged Sam to go with him. Frodo pretended to be moving to [[Buckland]], and sold Bag End to Lobelia, for which Hamfast was not so happy. He allowed Sam to go with Frodo to help and tend the garden of his new house, as he said.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

On [[23 September]], the night of the departure of Frodo and Sam, [[Khamûl]]<ref name=Note1>{{UT|Hunt}}, Notes, note 1</ref>, one of the [[Nazgûl]] rode up the lane as the elderly hobbit was taking his air, and asked about ""[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]"". The Gaffer told him that he had left for [[Bucklebury]] and it's not their business to know why, and refused to leave any message. The stranger hissed, making Hamfast shudder. Soon after the Nazgûl left, Sam arrived to give Hamfast the keys to Bag End before leaving. Surprised by Sam's arrival, the Gaffer told Sam about the stranger.<ref name=three/> 

[[29 September|A week later]], he was visited by [[Gandalf]] who he also informed about Frodo's whereabouts.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref><ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>

When [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and eventually [[Sharkey]] took over the Shire, the Gaffer was evicted from Bagshot Row.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After the [[Battle of Bywater]], in which he had only a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored Bagshot Row, the ""[[New Row]]."" He was looked after by the [[Widow Rumble]], which Frodo uses to comfort Sam about moving into [[Bag End]]. After his [[Elanor Gardner|granddaughter]] is born, Sam calls his father to decide upon a name. Gaffer tells him to stick with the tradition of naming hobbit-girls after flowers and Frodo gives Sam the name ""Elanor"". The Gaffer lived for another 7 years and died in [[Fourth Age 7]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

His son, Sam, named his seventh child [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]] after his father.<ref name=""Gamgee""/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Hamfast'' is a modernization of Old English ''hám-fæst'', meaning ""Stay-at-home"", or literally, ""Home-fast"". It is a translation of his [[Westron]] name, [[Ranugad]] [[Galbasi]].<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref> In the [[King's Letter]], the name (referring to [[Hamfast Gardner]], the fourth son of Sam and Rose, not the Gaffer) is translated into [[Sindarin]] as [[Baravorn]].<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref> 

""[[Wiktionary:gaffer|Gaffer]]"" is a colloquial word for ""old man"". It is a contraction of ""grandfather.""

==In other stories==
In the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', there is a resident in the village named Gaffer Gamgee who struggles to listen to the discussion between Mr Binks and Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] about whether Mr Bliss should be locked up for failure to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named [[Sam]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 63</ref>

==Inspiration==
In [[Letter 257]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930's. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Gamgee. This ""curious local character"" was ""an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like"". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer.
 
Tolkien had several encounters with actual Gamgees, however. [[wikipedia:Gamgee Tissue|Gamgee Tissue]], a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after [[wikipedia:Sampson Gamgee|J. Sampson Gamgee]] (1828-1886), a famous [[Birmingham]] surgeon,<ref>{{L|72}}</ref> whilst in the Black Country dialect cotton wool was referred to as ""gamgee"".<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://sedgleymanor.com/ The Ancient Manor of Sedgley]|articleurl=http://sedgleymanor.com/dictionaries/dialect.html|articlename=Black Country Dialect|accessed=9 September 2014}}</ref> The Gamgees were notorious surgeons - years later, Dr. Leonard Gamgee tended those war-wounded, including Lieutenant Tolkien.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]], ""Part Three: Castles in the air"", p. 206</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Gaffer does not appear in the film; but is mentioned to have been thrown out as Sam looks into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]].
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[John Church]] plays Gaffer Gamgee. He used a thick peasant accent for the role. He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Nazgul. Neither Frodo or Sam learn of this exchange. He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Hobbits for wearing ""ironmongery."" The Gaffer also is present as the travelers discuss how Sam should use Galadriel’s gift.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Hamfast ""Gaffer"" Gamgee is played by Wolfgang Reinsch. 

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Gaffer Gamgee.jpg|Gaffer in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''|right|thumb|150px]]
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Gaffer appears in the film's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], where he is played by [[Norman Forsey]]. The conversation in the Ivy Bush is moved to the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, though the dialogue remains much the same. He does not appear at Sam's marriage in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Dragon, but during the night, he informs Frodo of the Ringwraith that stalks the Shire. He was voiced by an uncredited [[Jim Piddock]].

[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Hamfast Gamgee.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Hamfast Gamgee in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Hamfast Gamgee is found working in his garden just outside Bag End. He only offers one regional Shire quest, but has more story involvement during various seasonal festivals.

==History==
Hob was a two-feathered [[Shirriff]]. Before the War of the Ring, he had watched [[Buckland]]'s [[Buckland Gate|Hay Gate]]. He was well acquainted with the [[Brandybuck Family]].

During [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]'s reign over the Shire, the Shirriffs were reorganized. Hob was old, and one of several shirriffs who were to guard the new fence at the [[Brandywine Bridge]] under the command of [[Bill Ferny]].

When [[Frodo Baggins]] and his [[Travellers|companions]] returned from their adventure, they found Hob at the gate who forbade them to enter the fence gate. After they chased off Ferny, Hob informed them of the changes in their homeland.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Etymology==
A ''hayward'' is a local official with the duty of inspecting fences and keeping cattle from straying.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 759</ref>

Hobson owned a ropewalk in [[Tighfield]]. After his death, Andy took over business, and took the surname ""Roper"".<ref>{{TT|Taming}}</ref>

'''Holman Greenhand''' was a Hobbit of [[the Shire]], noted for being a fine gardener.

==History==
Holman's grandfather and namesake, [[Holman the greenhanded]], initiated both the family name and the family profession: gardening.<ref name=""Gamgee"">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> Holman became a gardener in [[Hobbiton]], and one of the gardens he tended was that of [[Bag End]]. Around {{TA|2941}}, he took on his second cousin once-removed, [[Hamfast Gamgee]], as an apprentice.<ref name=""Party"">{{FR|Party}}</ref> 

One morning of that spring, [[Gandalf]] visited Bag End, but found its master, [[Bilbo Baggins]], not at home. Holman informed him that Bilbo had gone on one of his walks, as it was the [[Elves]]' [[Yestare|new year]]. Holman's description of Bilbo convinced Gandalf he had found the perfect man for his [[Quest for Erebor|mission]], to re-take [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name=""Quest"">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

When Bilbo went missing - that is, on his mission - Holman and Hamfast had their hands full in making sure the garden wasn't trampled as the place was swarming with Hobbits, hoping to get a piece of the Baggins estate.<ref name=""Party""/>

The Gaffer took over the job around {{TA|2961}},<ref>{{FR|Party}}: ""[Gaffer Gamgee] had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years""</ref> about which time Holman retired or died.

Holman was mentioned by the Gaffer to [[Ted Sandyman]], in a conversation which took place at a small inn on the Bywater road called [[The Ivy Bush]], in the year [[T.A. 3001]]; it was during this conversation that the Gaffer mentioned his relation to Holman (""him being my dad's cousin"").<ref name=""Party"" />

==Etymology==
Holman means ""hole-man"", and is distinct from the real-life English surname<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref> which contains ''holm'' ""river island"" rather than ''hol'' ""hole"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', ""Giving of Names""</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name ''Ilberic'' seems to be Germanic.

[[Wikipedia:Alberic|Alberic]] is a dwarf king in medieval German heroic literature who appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 191</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

'''Isumbras Took IV''' was the twenty-eighth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].
==History==
Isumbras was the third child, and second son, of [[Gerontius Took|Thain Gerontius]]<!--TCGTMe incorrectly says he was the ""third son""-->. His father's office passed to his elder brother [[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]], but because of their father's longevity, Isengrim's reign did not last long. As he left no heir, Isumbras became [[Thain]] at the age of ninety-two, even older than his brother was. He served for nine years before he died, and the office passed to his son [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
""Isumbras"" is of French and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and means ""iron-arm"". It comes from the French ''bras'' meaning ""arm"", and the Anglo-Saxon and Middle High German word ''[[isen]]'' which means ""iron"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', ""Giving of Names""</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] likely got the name from ''[[wikipedia:Sir Isumbras|Sir Isumbras]]'', an English medieval romance about a man who suffers a lifetime of hardship but who finds happiness in his latter years.

'''Lalia Took, née Clayhanger''', was the wife of [[Thain]] [[Fortinbras Took II]].
==History==
===Life===
Lalia was born in {{SR|1283}}, and married Fortinbras Took in {{SR|1314}}. They had one son, [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]], who was born in {{SR|1316|n}} before Fortinbras became [[Thain]] in {{SR|1339|n}}. In accordance with [[Took Family|Took]] family tradition, Lalia became the head of the family once her husband Fortinbras died in {{SR|1380|n}}. Ferumbras was unable to find a wife and it was alleged that this was because he could not find someone willing to share a house with Lalia, and Ferumbras was only accorded a small bachelor pad in Great Smials until after Lalia's death.

Lalia long outlived her husband and ruled the [[Took Family|Tooks]] of [[Great Smials]] for a further twenty-two years, becoming the great and memorable matriarch of the family known as ''Lalia the Great'' (or least courteously by those with less love for her, ''Lalia the Fat''). She was famous for her tremendous girth, which was rumoured to have prevented her attendance of [[Bilbo Baggins]]' famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Birthday Party]] in {{SR|1401|n}}.<ref name=""L214"">{{L|214}}</ref>

===Death===
In her later - and fattest - years it was her immobility rather than age which was the biggest problem for her so she went around in a wheelchair. In particular, she liked to be wheeled to the Great Door in the mornings so she could experience the fresh air.

She died in {{SR|1402|n}} at the grand old age of 119, after her clumsy attendant let Lalia's wheelchair run over the threshold which tipped Lalia down a flight of garden steps. It is rumoured that this attendant was [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]'s sister, [[Pearl Took]], as she was excluded from the celebrations of Ferumbras's accession to Thain, but the family tried to keep the details to themselves. However, shortly after Lalia's demise, she was seen with a priceless pearl necklace, believed to be a Took heirloom, implying she may have been rewarded for the ""accident"".<ref name=""L214""/>

==Etymology==
""Lalia"" is the latinized form of the classical Greek word ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%AC#Ancient_Greek λαλιά]'' meaning ""speech"".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/-lalia  -laila] at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster.com] (accessed 15 May 2011)</ref><ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-lalia -laila] at [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page Wiktionary.org] (accessed 15 May 2011)</ref>

{{Quote|I'll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!|Lobelia Sackville-Baggins in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[The Scouring of the Shire]]""}}
'''Lobelia Sackville-Baggins''', (née '''[[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]''') was the second child, and only daughter of [[Primrose Bracegirdle|Primrose Boffin]] and [[Blanco Bracegirdle]] and then the wife of [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], a distant relative of [[Bilbo Baggins]], known for her want of the hobbit-hole [[Bag End]].

==History==
Lobelia was born in [[Hardbottle]] to [[Primrose Bracegirdle|Primrose Boffin]] and [[Blanco Bracegirdle]] and the sister of [[Bruno Bracegirdle]]. Lobelia was renowned in the [[The Shire]] for her temper and greed. She later married [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s cousin [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], and they had one child together, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]], who was born in {{SR|1364}}.<ref name=""Bag"">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

Her envy of [[Bag End]] was well-known; when Bilbo left for [[Quest for Erebor|his legendary journey]] in {{SR|1341}}<ref name=""Return"">{{H|Return}}</ref> she coveted Bag End and found an oportunity to steal some of Bilbo's spoons, as Bilbo suspected after his return, and Lobelia knew well his suspicions. Lobelia and Otho were furious when Bilbo made [[Frodo Baggins]] his heir, him being a more distant relative. However, he did invite them to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|his farewell feast]], with magnificent invitations written with golden ink; Lobelia could not ignore it. The [[23 September|next day]] she and Otho came to Bag End, hearing that Bilbo's household was being given out, but Frodo said that what was directed to her was only a case of silver spoons. She took ""the point"", and took the gift. But later as Otho left, she was still there, investigating nooks and corners and tapping the floors, she had snatched some small valuable things in her umbrella, until Frodo relieved her and drove her out, as she shouted that he should also leave, being half [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]], did not belong here. [[Gandalf]] later saw her driving a pony-trap towards [[Bywater]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Her angry words to Frodo turned out to be true: he decided to leave for [[Crickhollow]] (a ruse to escape the Shire) he sold Bag End to Lobelia by [[June]] {{TA|3018}}, but unfortunately Lobelia was now centennial, and Otho had died by then. The titles would pass to her on [[24 September]] but she went there [[23 September|the previous day]] with Lotho, and an inventory list to inspect that that nothing she had paid for had been carried off to Buckland. She went right though her list, and in the end they departed with the spare key; Frodo said that his own would be left with the [[Gamgee Family]] and Lobelia reacted as if she thought that the Gamgees would rob the household until the next day.<ref name=""Company"">{{FR|I3}}</ref> 

During the [[War of the Ring]], Lobelia was imprisoned in [[Lockholes]] for arguing with the [[Chief Shirriff|Chief]]'s Men, and attacking one of them with an umbrella.<ref name=""Scouring"">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After finding [[Fredegar Bolger]], Frodo finds Lobelia, old and frail. As Frodo lets her out, Lobelia was popular for the first time for bravely standing up to the [[Saruman]]'s [[Ruffians|Men]], receiving cheers and applauds. However, she was crushed to find out her son had been murdered whilst she was in prison. After the War of the Ring, Lobelia returned to her home village to live with the other [[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]s, giving Bag End to Frodo. When she died in the Spring of {{TA|3020}}, she gave her money to Frodo to be used to help [[hobbits]] left homeless by Saruman and her son, which deeply moved Frodo.<ref name=""Grey"">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Lobelia|Lobelia]] is a genus of the bellflower family, named after [[Wikipedia:Matthias de L'Obel|Matthias de L'Obel]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"" p. 195</ref> Some species are commonly grown as garden flowers.

'''Lotho Sackville-Baggins''' ({{TA|2964}} - {{TA|3019|n}}, died aged 55) was the only child of [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]] and [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>  During the [[War of the Ring]] at the end of the [[Third Age]], he established a totalitarian regime within [[the Shire]].

== History ==
After Lotho's father, Otho, died in {{TA|3012}}, Lotho inherited his [[pipe-weed]] plantations in the [[Southfarthing]], ensuring his status as a wealthy Hobbit.<ref name=Scouring>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

According to [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Tolman Cotton]], Lotho had been quietly selling the best [[Pipe-weed]] for one or two years before the [[War of the Ring]] and he seemingly bought the [[Old Mill]] before [[Frodo Baggins]] sold [[Bag End]] to his family.<ref name=Scouring/>

On [[23 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> Lotho and Lobelia arrived at Bag End after lunch to take stock of the property and to obtain the keys.<ref name=Three/> Soon thereafter they moved into the residence, Lotho demolished the Old Mill and recruited outsiders to build a bigger mill and others like it in order to efficiently grind corn faster. By the end of that year, Lotho began buying an excessive amount of property as well as selling goods beyond Pipe-weed to many [[Men]] who came up from the south, mostly [[Ruffians]]. When folk began to complain about shortages that winter, Lotho had some Ruffians stay to assert his dominance over the Shire. At first, Lotho paid for all the stolen goods and damages that the Ruffians were responsible for. However, Lotho eventually stopped doing this. When [[Will Whitfoot]], the [[Mayor of the Shire]], set out to protest against Lotho's activities, he had his [[Sharkey's Men|Men]] incarcerate him in the [[Lockholes]].<ref name=Scouring/>

Soon after [[New Year]], with no Mayor of the Shire, Lotho began calling himself [[Shirriffs|Chief Shirriff]], and demanded to be acknowledged as the Chief, and did whatever he wanted with no one to stop one. He closed all of the inns and made his own version of ''[[The Rules]]'', turning the Shire into a totalitarian regime. When [[Thain]] [[Paladin II]] refused to acknowledge Lotho as the Chief, Lotho sent his Men to [[Tookland]], though the [[Took Family|Tooks]] did not give in and resisted.<ref name=Scouring/>

Lotho's regime within the Shire ended in [[September]] {{TA|3019|n}} when [[Sharkey]] arrived at Bag End<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> and took over the Shire from there. Soon Lotho was no longer seen in public and his mother, Lobelia, was taken to the Lockholes.<ref name=Scouring/>

It was later revealed that Lotho was stabbed (and possibly also eaten) by [[Gríma]] in his sleep at the order of [[Saruman]].<ref name=Scouring/>

== Legacy ==
After Sharkey usurped the rule of the Shire from Lotho, he had the Ruffians industrialize the new mill in order to pollute [[the Water]] and the [[Brandywine]], and life in the Shire became worse. Eventually however, when the [[Travellers]] returned, the Shire was retaken in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref name=Scouring/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Lotho'' represents an original [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]] name '''Lotha''' which was meaningless in contemporary speech.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Lotho was called '''Cosimo''' within two variants of an early draft of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', where he fought [[Sancho Proudfoot]] at [[Bag End]] being supported by his mother, Lobelia, whose umbrella broke upon Sancho's head.<ref name=Early>{{RS|Delays}}, pp. 276, 283 (Note 5)</ref> In a note to the draft, [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that this was Lotho's first appearance, and that in both of these variants, he had an overshadowed wife named [[Cora Goodbody|Miranda]],<ref name=Early/> though she was removed within the next draft of the text.<ref>{{RS|Journey}}, p. 324</ref> In another early draft, Cosimo's epithet was '''sandy-haired''' rather than Pimple.<ref>{{TI|Hobbiton}}, p. 32</ref>

In an isolated outline foreseeing the scouring, it is only Cosimo rather than Saruman, who industrialized the Shire with factories and smoke.<ref>{{TI|Story}}, p. 216 (Note 7)</ref> In a draft of [[The Mirror of Galadriel]] chapter, Frodo sees a very wealthy Cosimo buying a lot of land.<ref>{{TI|Galadriel}}, p. 249</ref> In another outline of plot notes, Tolkien wrote that the Sackville-Bagginses are kicked out of the Shire to become pot-boys in [[Bree]],<ref>{{TI|Farewell}}, p. 286</ref> presumably including Cosimo.

In an early version of [[The Land of Shadow]] chapter, Sam speculated that Cosimo may have made a mess in the Shire and that there would be trouble if they ever got back.<ref>{{SD|Shadow}}, pp. 32, 34</ref> In an outline of plot points, Tolkien wrote that when the Hobbits returned to the Shire, they drove out Cosimo.<ref>{{SD|Vs}}, p. 52</ref>

In an early version of the [[Many Partings]] chapter, Saruman genuinely warned the Travellers about the Shire, directly mentioning Cosimo by name.<ref>{{SD|Partings}}, pp. 65-6</ref>

In an early draft where Tolkien mapped out a conversation, Cosimo was originally going to be the '''New Mayor''' before Tolkien immediately changed his mind and made him the Chief Shirriff. In another draft, Merry mentions that none of the [[Bucklanders]] would allow Cosimo to dictate them.<ref>{{SD|Shire}}, pp. 77-9, 82-5, 88</ref>

'''Marigold Cotton (née Gamgee)''' was the youngest child of [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]].

==History==
Like all Gamgees, Marigold was close to the [[Cotton Family]]. She married [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom Cotton]], the eldest son of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]]. Marigold's brother, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], married Tom's sister [[Rose Cotton|Rose]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

Sam apparently had a close relationship with her, lamenting the prospect of not seeing her again during his time in [[Mordor]].<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

==Etymology==
""Marigold"" (from ''Mary'' + ''gold'') refers to the ''[[wikipedia:Tagetes|Tagetes]]'' annual plants of the daisy family.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] picked the name since it contains ""gold"" and referring to a golden flower, suggesting the [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] strain in Sam's family — which, increased by the favour of [[Galadriel]], became notable in his children.<ref name=""Nomen"">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Marigold is not a regular NPC present in the game, but rather appears during a single quest available only when the game's annual Yule-festival is active. She appears in front of [[Bag-End]] to sign a petition to remove [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] from her position as the Yule-planner.

[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name was inspired by the name ''Marmaduke'', spelled ''Marmaduc'' in medieval times, which is derived from Irish ''Maelmadoc'' (""Servant-(of)-Maedoc""). It is possible that this is a reference to the first name of his father, [[Madoc Brandybuck]], and that the first name of his grandfather [[Gormadoc Brandybuck]] is in turn a reference to the first name of Madoc Brandybuck.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 203</ref>

{{Quote|Take your sword and bear it unto good fortune!|[[Théoden]] to Merry, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]""}}

'''Meriadoc ''""Merry""'' Brandybuck''', called '''''The Magnificent''''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck]].<ref name=""tree"">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> He was one of the four Hobbits in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and later became the Knight of Rohan, participating in the slaying of the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]] alongside Lady [[Éowyn]].

Merry was an heir to the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] of [[Brandy Hall]]. After his participation to the [[War of the Ring]], he eventually inherited the [[Master of Buckland|Mastership]] in [[Buckland]] after his father's death.

==History==
Meriadoc was the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda]]. Claiming descent from [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], he also had  [[Took Family|Tookish]] blood through his mother, and also his father's grandmother, [[Mirabella Took]]. He was also first cousins with Peregrin Took.<ref name=""tree"" /> With him they wandered in the [[Marish]] and were friends of [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref name=""mushrooms"" />

Around {{TA|3000}} Merry witnessed a strange scene: he saw [[Bilbo Baggins]] becoming invisible in order to avoid a meeting with the [[Sackville-Bagginses]]. Startled, he got through the hedge and walked along the field inside, and watched as Bilbo reappeared, and put a [[The One Ring|glint of gold]] in his pocket. This made teenage Meriadoc very curious and he even looked into Bilbo's [[There and Back Again|private diary]].<ref name=""Conspiracy"" />

Merry kept this knowledge private but was always suspicious. He was present with his family at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]<ref name=""tree"" /> and [[23 September|the next day]] of Bilbo's disappearance, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had a hard day keeping his things from unwanted hobbits who came to loot [[Bag End]], and put Merry to keep an eye on them in order to rest; until the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]] came to Merry demanding to see Frodo. Later [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] left angrily calling Frodo a ""Brandybuck"", which Merry said was a compliment.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Since Bilbo's disappearance, he believed that Frodo would soon follow. He shared his secrets with [[Conspirators|a group of Frodo's friends]], namely [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Fredegar Bolger]]. Especially after [[April]] {{TA|3018}} he noticed how Frodo was saying ""farewell"" to his favourite places, selling [[Bag End]] to the [[Sackville-Bagginses]], and secretive talks with [[Gandalf]]. All along, Sam Gamgee had been their ""chief investigator"". He heard Gandalf's instructions to Frodo for his departure,<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> and warned his friends about it.<ref name=""Conspiracy"" />
[[File:Abe_Papakhian_-_A_Conspiracy_Unmasked.jpg|thumb|left|Abe Papakhian - ''A Conspiracy Unmasked'']]
The Conspirators, sought to protect Frodo (and [[The One Ring|the Ring]]) without his knowledge. When Frodo sold [[Bag End]] to move to [[Crickhollow]], Merry and Fredegar were told to wait for him and make preparations for his arrival.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> However, knowing that Frodo would begin a secret journey, also arranged for provisions and [[ponies]], planning to accompany him. On the [[September 25|appointed day]], Merry was worried that Frodo was late and as the fog was getting thick, he crossed the [[Bucklebury Ferry]] towards [[Stock]] to see if his friends were lost; just as he crossed, he saw [[Farmer Maggot]]'s wagon approaching, bringing Frodo, Sam and Pippin.<ref name=""mushrooms"">{{FR|Mushrooms}}</ref> 

After dinner in Crickhollow, Frodo prepared to reveal to his friends that he was going to have to leave Crickhollow and go to [[Rivendell]]. It was then that the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo and demanded to be taken along when he left. Because of their preparations, they were able to start right away.<ref name=""Conspiracy"">{{FR|I5}}</ref>

===Journey with Frodo===
{{quote|You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo.|Merry, ''[[A Conspiracy Unmasked]]''}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
During the following trip to [[Rivendell]], Merry seemed to have a greater knowledge of the [[Old Forest]] than any of the other Hobbits.  However, when they encountered [[Old Man Willow]] Merry (and Pippin) were both captured and had to be rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>  Merry and Pippin were captured again (along with Sam and Frodo) by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] upon the [[Barrow-downs]], but Tom again came to their rescue. Before leaving, he told them to keep the [[Daggers of Westernesse]] found in the Barrow Downs, and he advised them to spend the night at the [[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]], inside [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I8}}</ref> 
[[File:John Howe - Weathertop on the Horizon.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Weathertop on the Horizon'']]
Upon reaching the inn, Merry was out for a walk and saw a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]. He tried to follow it, but it disappeared. Merry was then overtaken by the [[Black Breath]] and fainted. But before any harm could come to him, [[Nob]] came to his aid; he returned to the Prancing Pony and warned his companions who were talking with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].<ref name=""Strider"">{{FR|I10}}</ref>  During the trip through the wild with Strider, he often saw the most deeply into the others.  After Frodo was wounded on [[Weathertop]], he became the one who consulted most with Strider, and in a way became the spokesman for the Hobbits.

After reaching [[Rivendell]], he, with Pippin, insisted on not being left behind on the [[Quest of the Ring]].  Therefore they were chosen as the eighth and ninth members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

At the gate of [[Moria]], [[Gandalf]] commended Merry for being ""''of all people''"" on the right track with the riddle (though this was accidental).  His impetuosity in Moria was such that he nearly fell into an ancient well while running ahead with Pippin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  When they reached [[Lothlórien]], he was allowed to sleep in a [[telain]] with Frodo, Sam, Pippin and a few elven guards. He, as with the rest of the Company, walked blindfolded into the Woods of Lórien in a show of support for [[Gimli]], who had to be blindfolded due to being a [[Dwarves|dwarf]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - The Plains of Rohan 2.jpg|thumb|""The Plains of Rohan"" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
At the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Merry and Pippin ran straight into a company of [[Orcs]] while they were looking for Frodo.  [[Boromir]] attempted to rescue them, but many [[Uruk-hai]] arrived, and they shot him with arrows.  Captured with Pippin by Uruk-hai, the two were separated from the rest of the Fellowship.  Merry aided Pippin in an attempt to deceive [[Grishnákh]] into thinking that they had the One Ring, and he could have it.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>  Because of this, they escaped into [[Fangorn Forest]] during the attack by [[Éomer]] and his [[Rohirrim|Outriders]]. There they met [[Treebeard]].  
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Wellinghall'']]
[[File:Zina Saunders - Flotsam and Jetsam.jpg|thumb|Zina Saunders - ''Flotsam and Jetsam'']]
Thus they became the first mortals for many centuries to encounter the [[Ents]] of Fangorn. They drank of the [[Ent-draughts|Ent-draught]] which caused Merry and Pippin to become the tallest hobbits in history. Also, they were present at the [[Entmoot]],<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> and the resulting destruction of [[Isengard]], after which Treebeard appointed them door-wardens of [[Orthanc]]. It was while they were enjoying [[Saruman]]'s [[pipe-weed]], that they were reunited with some of their former companions, who arrived after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

===Esquire of Théoden===
While Pippin and Gandalf headed away to [[Minas Tirith]], Merry stayed with Aragorn and the Rohirrim, developing a close friendship with King [[Théoden]].  Out of love for him, Merry offered the King his service, which Théoden warmly accepted.  ""''As a father you shall be to me''"", Merry said at that time, and Théoden responded ""''For a little while''"".<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

As Théoden's esquire, Merry returned with him to [[Edoras]] and was forbidden - firmly but gently - by the King to ride with them to the aid of Minas Tirith because he could not ride the mighty horses of the Rohirrim so fast and so far.  Merry was disappointed until a young rider named [[Dernhelm]] offered to bear him on his horse.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>  In this manner he rode to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], having a secret understanding with [[Elfhelm]] and several others of the Rohirrim.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Éowyn against Witch-king'']]
During the charge and the commencement of the battle he was almost useless, hiding behind Dernhelm and shaking with fright and nausea.  However, Dernhelm's steed, [[Windfola]], threw them both upon the coming of the [[Witch-king]].  Affected by the Black Breath, Merry lay almost senseless on the ground, hearing the voice of Dernhelm standing over the body of Théoden—who had been mortally wounded by the Witch-king—defying the Nazgûl.  He was startled as he opened his eyes to find that Dernhelm was really [[Éowyn]], the King's niece.  After Éowyn was thrown down, perhaps mortally wounded, Merry rose to attack the Witch-king in order to protect her.  He pierced the sinew behind the Witch-king's mighty knee with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]] he still bore, thus breaking the spell of invulnerability surrounding the Wraith.  He witnessed Éowyn's destruction of the Witch-king with a thrust into the head, and her subsequent collapse.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> After the death of the Witch-king, he begged forgiveness of a dying Théoden for disobeying his command to remain at Edoras, and the king forgave him with the words ""''Great heart will not be denied.''"" After the death of the king, he walked beside Théoden's pall-bearers, and fell into a stupor induced by the [[Black Breath]] at some point in his journey.<ref name=""Houses"">{{RK|V8}}</ref>

After the battle, Pippin found him ill and wandering in a daze outside of [[Minas Tirith]] and alerted Aragorn, who brought him into the city. Almost killed by the Black Breath, Merry and Éowyn were revived by Aragorn in the [[Houses of Healing]].<ref name=""Houses"" />  Because of his condition he was unable to take part in the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> but afterwards attended the burial of [[Théoden]], at which he wept greatly.  Upon his departure for the Shire, he was given a special horn by Éomer and Éowyn as a parting gift, which was later used in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

Upon the return to the Shire, he was, with Pippin, the primary leader of the uprising against [[Sharkey]] and his [[Ruffians]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

===After the war===
At some time he stayed with Pippin at Crickhollow<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and he married the sister of his friend Fredegar, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella]].

He was afterwards known as '''Meriadoc the Magnificent''', and became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father, and received great gifts from his friends King Éomer and Lady Éowyn.<ref name=""later"">{{App|Later}}</ref> He wrote several scholarly works which were probably part of the [[Red Book]]: ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'', ''The [[Reckoning of Years]]'' and ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''. At some point he visited Rivendell several times where probably he collected historical information from the remaining Elves there, and probably assisted the assembly of the [[Tale of Years]] in the [[Great Smials]].<ref name=""records"">{{FR|records}}</ref> In {{FoA|13}} he was made with Pippin and Sam Counsellor of the [[North-kingdom]].<ref name=""later"" />

In {{FoA|63}}<ref name=""records"" /> Meriadoc was 102 but still hale. That spring he received an invitation from King Éomer. With his friend they resigned from their offices and came down to Rohan<ref name=""later"" /> (presumably after the death of his wife) where he was known as Master Holbytla and [[Holdwine]] of the Shire.  

They stayed in Edoras with the King before he died that autumn, then they travelled to [[Gondor]] with Pippin, where he was known as Master [[Perian]], to spend their remaining years. They both were laid in [[Rath Dínen]].  It was said that upon [[Aragorn|King Elessar]]'s death, their bodies were placed beside his.<ref name=""later"" />

==Character==
[[File:Nia Kovaleski - Merry and Pippin.jpeg|thumb|right|''Merry and Pippin'' by [[:Category:Images by Nia Kovalevski|Nia Kovaleski]]]]He was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]], who eventually became the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and [[Peregrin Took]], a young relative.  He was one of the few (if any) who saw [[Bilbo Baggins]], Frodo's uncle, actually use [[the One Ring]].  He also managed to read, at least in part, Bilbo's book: ''[[There and Back Again]]'', where he learned about the Ring.<ref name=""Conspiracy"" />

He can easily be recognised as a very sharp Hobbit, and his tone throughout ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' depicts him as practical, loyal, resourceful, and the best able to cope with the sudden happenings that drew him out of his peaceful home.  He was also praised by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] as having a 'stout heart'<ref name=""Strider"" /> and [[Éowyn|Lady Éowyn]] as 'valiant'.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>  He was apparently much trusted by Frodo, who sent him along with [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] to [[Crickhollow]] to prepare his newly-bought home.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name '''''Meriadoc''''' means ""Great Lord"" in [[Welsh]] (from ''mawr'' ""great"" and ''udd'' ""lord"").<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.namenerds.com/welsh/meaning.html|articlename=Welsh Names|website=[http://www.namenerds.com/ Name Nerds]|accessed=21 February 2016}}</ref>

Merry's full [[Westron]] name was ''Kalimac'', which was abbreviated to ''Kali''.  As this latter means ""jolly, gay"", Tolkien translated it as ''Merry'', from which ''Meriadoc'' was chosen as a plausible full form.  This is in contrast to other Hobbit personal names, which were converted into roughly corresponding English forms.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

Tolkien himself comments on the ""[[Celtic]] cast"" of this and other [[Buckland]] and [[Bree]] names that end in ''–ac'', ''-ic'', or ''-oc''.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, ""[[The Appendix on Languages]]""</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the pre-publication manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Merry's name was originally ""Marmaduke Brandybuck"".<ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, p. 33</ref> He also had a cousin named ''Bercilak'', a name that is shared by the Green Knight from [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] in some translations.<ref>{{Webcite|articleurl=https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/class-clips-video/articles/zf2kxyc|articlename=KS2 English: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight - Episode 1|website=bbc.co.uk|accessed=25 July 2024}}</ref> This name was later changed to [[Lanorac Brandybuck]].<ref>{{RS|2XVI}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
''[[Wikipedia:Conan Meriadoc|Conan Meriadoc]]'' (also spelled ''Meriadek'') was the legendary leader of a group of Welsh mercenaries who settled Armorica (modern Brittany) in the fourth century and founded the [[Wikipedia:House of Rohan|House of Rohan]] in [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", ""The Celtic-sounding Names"", pp. 202-203</ref><ref>[[Mark T.

'''Merimac Brandybuck''' was a Hobbit of [[Buckland]].

==History==
Merimac was the youngest son of [[Rorimac Brandybuck]] and [[Menegilda Goold]]. He had one son, [[Berilac Brandybuck|Berilac]], and they were both present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Merimac'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

The name ''Merimac'' is, like most male Brandybuck names, Celtic in sound, but apparently meaningless. The first element, ''Meri'' also occurrs in the name ''[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]''. ''[[Wikipedia:Celtic onomastics|Mac]]'' is a Celtic word meaning ""son"", though it is unknown whether Tolkien used it with that meaning in mind.

The entire name also resembles ''[[wikipedia:Merrimac|Merrimac]]'', a name of a river and several towns in the United States. That word is of Native American origin.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 204</ref>

He was the youngest of the four children of [[Milo Burrows]] and [[Peony Baggins]], and when he was five years old he attended Bilbo's famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Birthday Party]] along with the rest of his family.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix C]] has Minto alone of his family ''not'' marked as having attented Bilbo's party, perhaps because of his young age. In any case, later editions (cf. [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]]) mark him as an antendee.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Minto appears in [[Hobbiton]], voiced by an uncredited [[James Arnold Taylor]]. If a conversation is started with him, he related how [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] had tried to chase him and [[Sancho Proudfoot]] off with her umbrella, and Minto had thrown an apple at her (but missed) in retaliation.

'''Mrs. Bunce''' was an old [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name=""Perry"">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Mrs. Bunce was ""walking the street"" in the early morning when she was greeted by the [[Lonely Troll]] who came into town to make a friend. As a consequence, she dropped her umbrella and basket, and ""yelled a frightful yell"" before running home to hide ""beneath her bed"". Her yell was heard by [[Pott the Mayor]], who dived underground in fear.<ref name=""Perry"" />

Later, Mrs. Bunce was among the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to [[Faraway]] in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll. Mrs. Bunce was among four Hobbits who the Troll never wanted to see again.<ref name=""Perry"" />

==Background==
In the first version of the poem in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was entitled ''The Bumpus'', Mrs. Bunce was called '''Mrs. Thomas''' and had the same role as in the latest version. However, in the first version, when the people all line up at the Bumpus's door, Mrs. Thomas is described as being ""late and last"" with ""her bonnet"" being askew.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> No changes to the character occurred in the second version on [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> in which Tolkien revised the poem as part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of his ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series. The third version also retained the same details in relation to Mrs. Thomas.<ref name=commentary/>

In early [[1961]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> when Tolkien revised the poem for inclusion within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', Mrs. Thomas was given the name Mrs. Bunce and her role was very slightly reduced.<ref name=collectedpoems/>

{{quote|Hi! Nob! ... Where are you, you wolly-footed slow-coach?|[[Barliman Butterbur]]<ref name=""Sign"">{{FR|Sign}}</ref>}}
'''Nob''' was a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] of [[Bree]].

==History==
Nob lived at the end of the [[Third Age]] and probably the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]]. He worked for [[Barliman Butterbur]] at ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' with [[Bob]], where he served food and tended to any other needs guests might have. 

On [[29 September|September 29]], {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Travellers|four Shire-hobbits]] came to ''The Prancing Pony''.<ref name=""Sign""/> When one of them, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], went missing after a night stroll, Nob found him near the house of [[Bill Ferny]].<ref name=""Strider"">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> Realizing the [[Nazgûl|danger]], Nob helped the Hobbits to disguise their beds, and kept watch at night. Nonetheless, the Inn was attacked.<ref name=""Knife"">{{FR|Knife}}</ref> 

When those four hobbits returned on [[28 October|October 28]] [[Third Age 3019|the following year]],<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> Nob still worked at ''The Prancing Pony''.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In historical English ''nob'' is slang to denote disrespect for a high society person, cf. ''knob'' ""head"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', Giving of names</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] think that ''Nob'' was perhaps chosen rhyme with ''Bob'', and that it does not appear to be recognized diminutive or nickname.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 151</ref> It is also possible that ''Nob'' was a nickname of a person named Robert; Tolkien's review of M. Förster's ''Die Französierung des englischen Personennamenschatzes'' mentions the name ''Nob'' in one line with better known names as ''[[Hob Hayward|Hob]]'' and ''Rob''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ""Philology: General works"", published in ''[[The Year's Work in English Studies]]'', vol. 6 (edited by Boas and Hereford), pages 32-66, esp 39</ref>

Noakes was a regular at the [[Ivy Bush]], and a friend of [[Gaffer Gamgee|the Gaffer]]'s. He was present at his drink just before [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].

==Etymology==
Noake(s) or Noke(s) is a real-life English surname, derived probably from the place-name No(a)ke, etymologized as ''atten oke'' ""at the oak"".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 761</ref>

==History==
Otho was the only known child of [[Longo Baggins]] and [[Camellia Sackville]].<ref name=""Baggins"">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> Through his mother, he was the head of the [[Sackville Family]], so he adopted the double surname out of custom.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref> Otho had [[pipe-weed]] plantations in the [[Southfarthing]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] with whom he had a son named [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].

He was also second in line to patriarchy of the [[Baggins Family]], and would have been [[Bilbo Baggins]]' heir were it not for his adoption of his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. This did not sit well with Otho and his wife, as they both dearly wanted to live in [[Bag End]].<ref name=""Party"">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Otho was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo had vanished in front of the crowd during the celebration, Otho and his wife departed in wrath. The [[23 September|next day]] he and Lobelia visited Bag End and demanded from [[Merry Brandybuck]] to see Frodo and insisted on seeing Bilbo's will, which, unfortunately for him, was valid and clear that Frodo was his legal heir.<ref name=""Party""/> 

He did not live long enough to see Bag End as he died in {{SR|1412}}; it was six years later when Lobelia eventually did come into possession of Bag End, and moved in with her son.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Otho'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Otha''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

'''Paladin Took I''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]] who held the position of [[Thain]] some time between {{SR|740}} and {{SR|1083}}.

==History==
There are no direct records of Paladin I but he was evidently the namesake of [[Paladin Took II|Paladin II]].<ref name=""App|Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref> Paladin I's reign as Thain came between the beginning of the Took line of Thains in {{SR|740}} and the reign of [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]], which began in {{SR|1083}}, after which there were no gaps in the Took family's genealogy.<ref name=""App|B2"">{{App|B2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
A ""[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]"" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was a noble office held by an honourable and valiant knight. In particular, a paladin was one of the twelve peers of Charlemagne's court. The term comes from the Latin ''palatinus'' which means ""of the palace"".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', ""Giving of Names""</ref>

'''Paladin Took II''' was the thirty-first [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]]. He was the father of [[Peregrin Took]].

==History==
===Family===
Paladin was born in {{SR|1333}} being the son and heir of [[Adalgrim Took]], and a great-grandchild of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. He married [[Eglantine Banks]], and they had several children together: [[Pearl Took|Pearl]] (born {{SR|1375|n}}) followed by [[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]] ({{SR|1379|n}}) and [[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]] ({{SR|1385|n}}). [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] ({{SR|1390|n}}) was younger, but would be Paladin's heir.<ref name=""Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref>

===Becoming Thain===
Paladin was a direct descendant of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], one of his great grandsons. He was member of a junior branch of the Took family, where [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]] was head of that branch.<ref name=""Took""/> He became a farmer, farming the lands around [[Whitwell]] near [[Tuckborough]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> Never did he expect to become Thain as at the time of his birth the Thainship was in the hands of, [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]], his great uncle. Isumbras IV's succession appeared secure since he had both a son and grandson, [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]] and [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]]. However, Ferumbras III died without an heir in {{SR|1415}} and Fortinbras II had had no other sons, so the Thainship passed to Paladin, the most senior male-line relative.<ref name=""L214"">{{L|214}}</ref> 

In {{SR|1401}} he attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his children.<ref name=""Took""/>

===War of the Ring===
Paladin never agreed with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' attempt to take over [[the Shire]] as he believed that if anyone were going to the ""Chief"" it should be the legitimate [[Thain of the Shire]], therefore Paladin and the other Tooks stood up to Lotho and his [[Ruffians]]. The [[Took Family|Took]]s hid in their deep dwellings of [[Great Smials]], and the ruffians could not get them, and if any ruffians were found in the [[Tookland]] they were shot and killed, an act which led the ruffians to become harsher.<ref name=""Scouring"">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

At this time, Paladin's son [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] and [[Travellers|three other hobbits]], were lost in the [[Old Forest]] by all accounts. Their return was unexpected, but Paladin fully embraced their suggestion to drive out the Ruffians. He sent a hundred Tooks with his son to the [[Battle of Bywater]], and commanded the remainder of his troops cleaning up the area south of the village.<ref name=""Scouring""/>

===Death===
Paladin died in {{SR|1434}} at the age of 101, and after having been Thain for nineteen years, he was succeeded by his son who became Thain Peregrin I.<ref name=""Took""/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Paladin'' is derived from Latin ''palatinus'', which means ""palace officer"".<ref name=""IE"">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref> It was used for the twelve peers of [[wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]],<ref name=""IE""/> the emperor of the [[wikipedia:Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Empire]], an empire in Western and Central Europe that was dominated by the [[wikipedia:Franks|Franks]].

A ""[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]"" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was a noble office held by an honourable and valiant knight.

'''Pearl Took''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

== History ==
Pearl was the eldest child of [[Thain]] [[Paladin Took II]] and [[Eglantine Banks]].<ref name=""Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref> She was the caretaker of [[Lalia Clayhanger|Lalia the Fat]], the rotund, aged, and immensely annoying (to the Tooks) matriarch of the family. Each morning, Pearl was to push her wheelchair outside so Lalia could experience fresh air.<ref name=""L214"">{{L|214}}</ref>

In {{SR|1401}} she was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name=""Took""/>

One morning in {{SR|1402}}, Pearl was a little bit careless in her custom of tending old Lalia, and the matriarch flew across the steps to her death. Pearl was excluded from the accession ceremony of [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]], who had been waiting to become head of the clan for quite a while (he had already been Thain since the death of his father). She was, however, afterwards spotted with a necklace of pearls believed to be a Took family heirloom.<ref name=""L214""/>

== Etymology ==
Pearl's name follows the Hobbit custom of high-class women being named after jewels.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', ""Giving of Names""</ref>

<center>{{quote|There must be someone with intelligence in [[Fellowship of the Ring|the party]].""<br>""Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!|Pippin and [[Gandalf]], ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Ring Goes South]]""}}</center>

'''Peregrin ''""Pippin""'' Took''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], the son of [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]]. He was the youngest of the four Hobbits in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], being in his tweens, but grew up quickly and eventually became a Knight of Gondor. [[Elrond]], at least, seemed to doubt his capability for the quest, but Pippin proved to be a loyal and courageous friend.

After the [[War of the Ring]], Peregrin eventually inherited the [[Thain]]ship in [[the Shire]] after his father's death.

==Ancestry==
He was born in the [[Third Age]] [[Third Age 2990|2990]] (1390 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) to [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]] and [[Eglantine Banks]], making him a great-great-grandson of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. Pippin became Thain in later years, and his father inherited the title in S.R. 1415 from [[Ferumbras Took III]] when he died without an heir. Pippin had three older sisters, [[Pearl Took]], [[Pimpernel Took]], and [[Pervinca Took]].<ref name=""Took"">{{App|Took}}</ref>

Through his father, Pippin was a first cousin of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] (the future [[Master of Buckland]]), the second cousin once removed of [[Frodo Baggins]], and the first cousin twice removed of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was not blood-related to [[Samwise Gamgee]], but Pippin's son [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]] married Sam's daughter [[Goldilocks Gardner]] in 1463.

==History==
When he was young he was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his family. As his uncle the [[Thain]] [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]] was childless, Pippin's father, Paladin, became the Thain.<ref name=""Took"" /> Pippin's closest friends were his cousins, [[Merry Brandybuck]] and Frodo<ref name=""shadow"">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> (all descendants of the Old Took). Pippin and Merry often wandered at the [[Marish]] and used to visit [[Farmer Maggot]]; he knew the lands around the Marish and enjoyed the beer of the ''[[Golden Perch]]'' at [[Stock]].<ref name=""short"">{{FR|I4}}</ref>

He was one of the [[Conspirators]], who knew the truth behind Frodo's mysterious behaviour and reasons for departure of the Shire. Along with Merry, [[Fredegar Bolger]] and [[Folco Boffin]] they helped Frodo pack his household and send carts to [[Crickhollow]]; they celebrated together his last [[22 September|birthday]] in [[Bag End]], and stayed with Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] when the others left for [[Buckland]].

===Travels with Frodo===
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Three is Company.jpg|thumb|left|''Three is Company'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
The [[23 September|next day]] he accompanied Frodo and Sam to [[Bucklebury]]. During the first days of the travel, Pippin was he who complained first for being tired, sleepy or hungry. The [[24 September|next day]] they encountered [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] who were turned away by a [[Wandering Companies|company]] of [[High Elves]] led by [[Gildor]], and Pippin greeted them expressing his respect. During their camp he felt he was in a dream, enchanted by the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of their faces and their beautiful voices. Once he fell asleep, the Elves moved and laid him to a soft bed at a bower under the trees.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

The [[25 September|other morning]] he woke up first and wanted to finish off the elven bread if not for Sam's insistence to leave some for him and Frodo. When Frodo woke up they had an argument as Frodo wanted to cut through Marish to avoid any Black Riders, and Pippin regretted for not stopping at Stock.<ref name=""short"" />

In Buckland, they joined Merry and Fatty. It was there that Frodo learned about his friends' ""conspiracy"" and that they did not intend to let him leave [[The Shire]] without them. They left the Shire to meet [[Gandalf]] in [[Bree]]. Pippin's enthusiasm to accompany Frodo is the result of his adventurous 'Tookish' nature as well as his loyalty and friendship to his cousin.

The stuffiness and eeriness of [[The Old Forest]] made Pippin the most uncomfortable of the four [[Hobbits]] with him becoming more and more suspicious of the intentions of the Forest; Pippin was, however, right to be suspicious as he was trapped by [[Old Man Willow]] before being rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]]. On the way to [[Bree]], from Tom Bombadil's house, Pippin again fell into misfortune as he was trapped by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] on the [[Barrow-downs]]. 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
Whilst at [[The Prancing Pony]] Pippin began to recklessly tell the story of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s birthday and subsequent disappearance. In order to prevent information about the Ring being revealed, Frodo started to sing - during the song Frodo fell from the table and the Ring slipped upon his finger. As a result, The Prancing Pony was attacked by the [[Nazgûl]] during the night, but the four Hobbits were unharmed thanks to the mysterious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], [[Aragorn|Strider]].

===Fellowship of the Ring===
When Pippin finally arrived at [[Rivendell]] he was concerned that he and Merry would be left behind whilst both Sam and Frodo get to go on the [[Quest of the Ring|Quest]]. However, his indignant attitude paid off as [[Gandalf]] believed that the friendship between Pippin and the other Hobbits would be beneficial to the Quest.

When in [[Moria]], Pippin incurred the wrath of Gandalf on two separate occasions: Pippin annoyed Gandalf with a foolish question while Gandalf was trying to open the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]]; and, when inside the [[Well-chamber]] in Moria,<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]], p. 40</ref> Pippin's curiosity got the better of him as he dropped a stone down a well which lead to the [[Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]] hearing the drums in the deep - in doing so Pippin gained the retort, ""''Fool of a Took!''"" from Gandalf.

===With Treebeard===
During the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Boromir]] died defending Merry and Pippin from capture by the [[Uruk-hai]] who were taking the Hobbits back to [[Saruman]] at [[Isengard]] on the mistaken belief that one of them had [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. On the journey to Isengard, Pippin displayed intelligence and resourcefulness by cutting his own bonds and leaving his [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]] from [[Lothlórien]] on the ground for Aragorn to find.

Whilst held captive, Merry and Pippin became aware that the [[Orcs|Orc]] [[Grishnákh]] had guessed that they might have the Ring, so they used Grishnákh's greed to untie them and take them away from the other Orcs. When the [[Rohirrim]] attacked the Uruk-hai, Grishnákh was killed by a spear and Merry and Pippin were able to escape into [[Fangorn Forest]] where they encountered [[Treebeard]] and the other [[Ents]].

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Wellinghall'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Merry and Pippin struck up a friendship with Treebeard, telling him about all that had happened on their journey, whilst Treebeard told the two hobbits about the loss of the [[Entwives]](and much more besides). Treebeard decided to call an [[Entmoot]] at [[Derndingle]] to decide the Ents' next move. While the Entmoot was going on, Pippin and Merry were left in the care of a 'hasty' Ent named [[Quickbeam]] who had already decided to go to battle with the Orcs as many of his tree friends had been killed.
[[File:Peter Pracownik - Six of Cups (LOTR).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin relax and joke after the fall of [[Orthanc]] - Art by [[Peter Pracownik]]]]
Merry and Pippin [[Ents#The March of the Ents|marched with the Ents]] to Isengard where the Ents killed the remaining servants of Saruman, filled the [[Ring of Isengard]] with water, and kept Saruman hostage in [[Orthanc]]. Whilst sitting on their ""field of victory"", Merry and Pippin were reunited with Aragorn, [[Gandalf]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] with whom they shared some [[pipe-weed]] and a meal. 

Following Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, [[Gríma]] threw the [[Orthanc-stone|palantír of Isengard]] out of the window at Gandalf which Pippin subsequently picked up. After Gandalf took it from him, Pippin remained curious about it, and later remarked to Merry about how he would like to look at it again. Unable to sleep, Pippin was finally overcome by curiosity. He stole the palantír from Gandalf's keeping while he slept, but when he looked into it, he was seen by [[Sauron]] who mistakenly believed that Pippin and the Ring were with Saruman in Isengard. After a Nazgûl flew by on its [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]], Gandalf realised that war was coming soon, and he rode immediately for [[Minas Tirith]], taking Pippin with him for safe keeping.

===Guard of the Citadel===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Pippin Comforts Merry.jpeg|thumb|right|''Pippin Comforts Merry'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Upon arriving in Minas Tirith, Pippin went with Gandalf to the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] and recounted Boromir's death to [[Denethor]], who was Boromir's father as well as the [[Ruling Steward]]. In return for Boromir's untimely death, Pippin decided to pledge his allegiance to the grieving [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] and so became a [[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]]. Pippin befriended [[Beregond]], of the [[Third Company of the Citadel]], who showed him 'round the city and told him the secret passwords and ways of the city, and became good friends with Beregond's son [[Bergil]].

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Pyre of Denethor.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Pyre of Denethor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Denethor was amused with the Hobbit's manners, especially the way he spoke to him in a very informal and personalized familiar language, as with a close friend or social equal, since the [[Hobbitish|Hobbit-speech]] lacked formal forms. Denethor's servants were astonished to this view, and probably gave strength to the rumor that Pippin was of very high social rank within his own country, and soon a wild rumor circulated, that the ""[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]"" had promised 5,000 Hobbits to the defence of the city.

During the [[Siege of Gondor]], Pippin was instrumental in saving [[Faramir]]'s life. After Faramir had returned from battle, he was badly wounded and suffering from the [[Black Breath]]; [[Denethor]] looked into the [[Anor-stone|palantír of Minas Tirith]] and saw the full might of [[Mordor]]. Believing that Sauron's forces would prevail in battle, Denethor ordered his servants to set a pyre so both he and Faramir could burn alive, but Pippin was able to fetch Gandalf and Beregond who were both able to help save Faramir.

After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Pippin found [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] all in a daze - due to Merry's confrontation with the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] - and took him to the [[Houses of Healing]] where he was healed by [[Aragorn]]. Pippin accompanied the forces of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] to the [[Black Gate]] where he participated in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and saved Beregond's life by slaying a [[Hill-trolls|hill-troll]]. Pippin was crushed beneath the troll, but he was pulled out by [[Gimli]] who recognized his foot.

===Return to the Shire===
When Pippin and the other Hobbits returned to The Shire, they were enraged to see what had happened to their peaceful corner of the world. Pippin went off to [[Tookland]] to raise up the [[Took Family|Took]]s in rebellion, and when he returned for the [[Battle of Bywater]] he brought 100 strong hobbits with him. Pippin and Merry jointly commanded the Hobbit victory and their names were placed at the top of [[The Roll]] commemorating those who fought in the battle.<ref name=""Scouring"">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Pippin and Diamond.jpg|thumb|left|Pippin meets his future wife.]]
Pippin and Merry were heroes, and would tell all the other hobbits the stories of their travels to far-off lands. They would often go out abroad wearing their armour (Pippin had remained a Knight of Gondor) and people thought they were lordly - a position likely enforced by their extraordinary height caused by the [[Ent-draughts]] (they were at least 4'5<nowiki>''</nowiki> tall - taller than [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]]).<ref name=""Concerning"">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

In {{SR|1427}} (at the age of 37), he married [[Diamond of Long Cleeve]], and they had a child together, [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]], [[Fourth Age 9|three years later]].<ref name=""later"" /> 
===Thainship===
[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Thain Peregrin I.jpg|thumb|''Thain Peregrin I'' by Gregor Roffalski]]
In {{SR|1434}} (at the age of 44) Pippin succeeded his father [[Paladin Took II|Paladin]] by becoming the 32nd [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]], and was also made a Counsellor of the North-kingdom by King Elessar.<ref name=""later"" />

In {{SR|1436}} King Elessar rode north and met Pippin, Merry and Sam at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. In {{SR|1452}} the King, as a gift, added the [[Westmarch]] to The Shire, and in {{SR|1462}} at Sam's request Pippin appointed [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]] - son-in-law of Sam - as the first [[Warden of Westmarch]].<ref name=""later"" />

As Thain, Pippin collected a library of historical information at [[Great Smials]], especially information relating to [[Númenor]] and the heirs of [[Elendil]]. It was at Great Smials that ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' was likely put together, with assistance from Merry, although Pippin himself probably didn't write any works. His successors expanded the collection.<ref name=""Records"">{{FR|Records}}</ref>

In {{SR|1484}}, at the age of 94 and having been Thain for 50 years, Pippin and Merry passed on their possessions and offices to their sons and left [[The Shire]] to visit [[Rohan]] where they stayed with [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]] for his last days. Then they moved to [[Gondor]] where they spent their last few years. Their bodies were placed in [[Rath Dínen]]; they were later laid beside King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] following his death in {{FoA|120}} ({{SR|1541}}).<ref name=""later"" />

==Etymology==
'''Peregrin''' is a translation of Pippin's [[Hobbitish]] name ''Razanur'', which was the name of a legendary traveller. It probably contains the [[Westron]] elements ''razan'' (""stranger""), ''raza'' (""foreign""), which is why [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose ''Peregrin'' to represent ''Razanur''.<ref name=""PM"">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, On Translation, $49</ref> When Peregrin Took became Thain he was registered as '''Thain Peregrin I'''.<ref name=""Took"" />

The name ''[[wikipedia:Peregrine (name)|Peregrin]]'' is derived from Latin ''peregrinus'', which means ""foreign"". The term was used for a person who wandered abroad. The English word ''pilgrim'' is derived from the same root.<ref name=""Jim Allen"">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref>

==Other names==
*'''[[wikipedia:Pippin (name)|Pippin]]''' is a 'pet-form' of ''Peregrin'' related to the Westron abbreviation ''[[Razar]]'' which is a type of small red [[apples|apple]].<ref name=""PM""/>
*'''[[Razanur Tûk]]''' - Peregrin's true [[Westron]] name.<ref name=""PM""/>
*""''Fool of a Took''"" and ""''Tom-fool of a Took''"" - given to him by [[Gandalf]] for his often mischievous behaviour, and, in particular, for dropping a stone down the well in [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
*''[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]'' - [[Sindarin]] for ""Prince of the Halflings"", an erroneous title given to Pippin by the people of [[Minas Tirith]] on the belief he must be of high importance to be travelling with Gandalf.<ref name=""Minas"">{{RK|V1}}</ref>
*[[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]] - the office Pippin held when he swore fealty to [[Denethor]].<ref name=""Minas"" />
*Knight of Gondor - a position which Aragorn confirmed Pippin held;<ref name=""Partings"">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> it is unclear whether being a Guard of the Citadel equates to being a Knight or if Aragorn elevated him to that position.
*[[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]] - a position granted to Pippin when he became Thain.<ref name=""later"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''), Frodo's counterpart Bingo Baggins was accompanied by his Took nephews, Frodo and Odo. They were similar characters but Odo was more limited and unaware than Frodo (Took) while Frodo was ""more susceptible to the beauty and otherness of the Elves"". Christopher Tolkien speculates that some aspects of Frodo Took have been preserved in Samwise Gamgee. Through a process that [[Christopher Tolkien]] described as ""strangely torturous"" these characters were gradually folded into the singular character of Peregrin Took.<ref>{{RS|1IIU}}</ref>

'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:After [[Gandalf]] encourages [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] to take [[The One Ring]] to [[Rivendell]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin decide they will accompany him. The [[Hobbits]] cross the main country road from [[Michel Delving]] to [[Bywater]] and go east through [[Green Hill Country]]. They flee the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] on the road to [[Woodhall]], and the [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. They hide from the Riders and, after they leave, watch a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and eat food. The Hobbits decide to avoid all roads and take the path through the [[Old Forest]]. When camping for the night, they discover that Pippin has been completely swallowed by the [[Old Man Willow]] and Merry’s legs are sticking out. Frodo finds it impossible to set them free until helped by [[Tom Bombadil]]. Tom sings, which loosens the Tree, and pulls Merry and then Pippin out of the tree. The Hobbits continue on to [[Bree]] and meet Strider at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]]''. After a letter from Gandalf tells that his true name is [[Aragorn]] and that he is to be trusted, the Hobbits join him on the way to Rivendell. Frodo is attacked by Black Riders on the way and [[Glorfindel]] heals him, though he is still injured, and gifts him his horse [[Asfaloth]]. The Hobbits arrive at Rivendell and Frodo awakens from his coma four days later. The Hobbits and the others in Rivendell hold a lively feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes and they decide to take the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire where it was created. A [[Fellowship of the Ring]] is formed, comrpising The Hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]. Pippin departs third last, behind Merry and before Gimli. The Fellowship takes one final look at the House of [[Elrond]] and departs.

:[[Mac McCaddon]] provided the voice of Pippin.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Pippin was voiced by the American actor [[Sonny Melendrez]]. He and Merry meet on the Pelennor Fields prior to the fall of the Witch-king. Pippin also does not accompany the army that marches to the Black Gate.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''

:The role of Pippin is played by [[David Learner]].

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:[[Billy Boyd]] played Pippin. His characterisation differed from the book, as he was more heavily relied upon for comic relief in the movies than in the book. Frodo's move to Crickhollow and the conspiracy are both omitted, so Pippin and Merry instead become entangled in the Quest of the Ring by accident when they run into Frodo and Sam while raiding Farmer Maggot's crop, neither of them having any prior knowledge of the One Ring or Frodo's quest.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Peregrin Took is provided by Robert Roth. He is addressed almost exclusively by his nickname Pippin. Roth portrays Pippin as resourceful, but a bit of a rascal and happy-go-lucky, befitting his position as the youngest and least experienced hobbit of the quartet.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:[[James Arnold Taylor]] provides the voice of Pippin. He is the comic relief character, and his jokes are primarily centered on food.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The player catches up with Pippin at several points in his journey: in [[Rivendell]], at [[Cerin Amroth]] in [[Lothlórien]], at the ruins of [[Isengard]], and in [[Minas Tirith]]. The adventures of Merry and Pippin from after being captured by the Uruks up to the destruction of Isengard by the [[Ents]] are related in a series of Session Plays. After the destruction of the Ring but before the departure of the Fellowship from [[Minas Tirith]], Merry and Pippin become involved in additional adventures in [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]].

'''Robin Smallburrow''' was a [[Shirriff]] from [[Hobbiton]].
==History==
Born and raised in [[Hobbiton]], Robin was of old a friend of the [[Gamgee Family|Gamgee]]s. He loved being outdoors, and became a [[Shirriff]] so he could meet new people (and, equally important, inns).<ref name=""Scouring"">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

Originally one of only twelve,<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> during [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' reign, Robin found himself in over his head. He was reassigned to the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]] in [[Frogmorton]], tasked with enforcing [[The Rules]]. 

Robin was one of the Shirriffs sent to arrest [[Travellers|four Hobbits]] who had illegally entered the Shire at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. It was more of an escort than an arrest, as Robin and his troops were on foot and the four Hobbits had ponies. At the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], the Shirriffs gave up and let their prisoners go on without them.<ref name=""Scouring"" /> It's not stated if he was among the Sheriffs who joined in the revolt.

==Etymology==
The name ""Smallburrow"" may imply Robin came from a poor family, as only the rich lived in [[smials]]. His name bears some resemblance to the mythical [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/puckrobin/puckbals.html Robin Goodfellow].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Robin Smallburrow can be found at the [[Green Dragon]], voiced by an uncredited [[James Arnold Taylor]]. [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] orders [[Frodo Baggins]] to ring the town bell to warn Robin that wolves are in the Shire, which Robin will dismiss as being a rumour. Later at night, he is attacked by a wolf on the streets of [[Bywater]]. Frodo can either let the wolf kill him, or save him to increase his Purity meter.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Shirriff Robin Smallburrow is found at ''[[The Ivy Bush]]'' tavern in [[Hobbiton]]. He helps the player to deal with a problem in [[Overhill]] and is also involved in several seasonal festivals.

'''Rorimac Brandybuck''', also known as '''Old Rory''' and '''Goldfather''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] and [[Master of Buckland]].

==History==
Rorimac was the oldest son of [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]]. He married [[Menegilda Goold]] and had two sons, [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Merimac Brandybuck|Merimac]]. He became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father's death in {{SR|1363}}.<ref name=""Brandybuck"">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

After the deaths of his sister, [[Primula Brandybuck]] and her husband [[Drogo Baggins]] in {{SR|1380}}, Rorimac took their son, [[Frodo Baggins]] under his guardianship in [[Brandy Hall]] for nine years. [[Bilbo Baggins]], a kinsman of Drogo, often enjoyed Old Rory's hospitality, and eventually he proposed that Frodo could come with him to [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Rorimac was present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo's [[Unseen|disappearance]], Rory was one of the first, if not the only, to suspect ""Mad Baggins"" was off on an adventure again, and told so to his [[Esmeralda Took|daughter-in-law]] to quiet her shock; he expressed satisfaction that there was more food to feast with and promptly asked his nephew Frodo for more wine. As part of his departure, Bilbo left him a dozen of bottles of [[Old Winyards]], and as soon as he tasted the first one, Rory voted Bilbo a capital fellow.<ref name=party/>

Rory died six years later, passing on the title of Master of Buckland to his eldest son [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]].<ref name=""Brandybuck""/>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

''Rory'' is a northern Irish form of the [[Celtic]] name ''Rhuadri'' or ''Rhuaidri'', which means ""red"" or ""ruddy"". An ancient Irish hero wasd called Rory O'More. Rory or as a full name ''madadh ruadh'' (""red dog"") is the common name for the fox in many Higland tales where the fox is portrayed as shrewd. This is a fitting name for Rory Brandybuck, because we are told about him that ""neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits"".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 204</ref>

==Etymolgy==
The meaning of the name ''Sadoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

A Cornish knight named ''Sadoc'' who becomes a Knight of the Round Table and a knight of Orkney named ''Sadoc'' appear in Malory's ''Le Morte Darthur''. There also exists the [[Welsh]] name ''Cadoc'' that is derived from ''cad'' (""battle"").<ref name=""Allan"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 204</ref>

==Inspiration==
Two knights called ''Sadoc'' play a role in Malory's ''Le Morte Darthur'': a ''Sadoc'' who is a Cornish knight who is friendly to Sir Tristram and a ''Sadoc'' who is a knight of Orkney.<ref name=""Allan""/> ''Cadoc'' is also the name of a Welsh [[Wikipedia:Cadoc|saint]].

<center>{{quote|I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam|[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[Mount Doom]]""}}</center>

'''Samwise Gamgee''', commonly known as '''Sam''', was [[Frodo Baggins]]' servant and the only original member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to remain with him to the very end of the journey to [[Mount Doom]].

==History==
===Early life===
Samwise lived with his father, [[Hamfast Gamgee]], better known as ""The Gaffer"", on [[Bagshot Row]] in [[The Shire]], close to [[Bag End]]. Sam's mother was [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]]; he had five siblings: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]]. He was a friend of the [[Cotton Family|Cotton family]] and used to play in [[Bywater Pool]] with [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom]], [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]], and [[Rose Cotton|Rosie Cotton]] specifically.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of plain speech. He helped his Gaffer tending the garden of Bag End and was taught the art of rope making by his [[Hobson|grandfather]] and his uncle [[Andwise Roper|Andy]]. In his work at Bag-End, he was acquainted with [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Bilbo taught him [[tengwar|letters]], and nurtured his love for [[Elves]], poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of. This set him apart from the beginning to the Gaffer's dismay.<ref>{{FR|Party}};{{TT|Taming}}</ref> Sam often wandered outside [[Hobbiton]] and knew well the area twenty miles around.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

On [[12 April]] Sam was in ''[[The Green Dragon]]'' and discussed with [[Ted Sandyman]] the strange rumours he heard around the Shire, including his [[Hal Gamgee|cousin Hal]] seeing a [[Tree-men|Tree-man]], and the [[Elves]] who leave [[Middle-earth]]. Ted called his cousin crazy and dismissed all rumours. In the evening, he returned to [[Hobbiton Hill]] thinking about the hard work he has to do when he saw [[Gandalf]] arriving to visit Frodo, after many years.<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

===Eavesdropping on Frodo and Gandalf===
Sam was one of the ""[[Conspirators]]"" who were summoned by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] in order to watch over [[Frodo Baggins]] and the [[The One Ring|Ring]] inherited by Frodo from Bilbo. Being the closest to Frodo, Sam was their ""chief investigator"" who was to eavesdrop on his talks with Gandalf the [[Wizards|Wizard]].<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>

He eavesdrops on Frodo and Gandalf's discussion while working at the garden of Bag End. It was when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is [[Sauron]]'s One Ring, and on the mention that Frodo must leave the Shire, Sam choked. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity. Sam begged Gandalf not to turn him into anything ""unnatural"". Sam then immediately asked to be taken to see Elves when they went away. Gandalf decided to make Sam Frodo's first companion.<ref name=shadow/> 

===From Hobbiton to Crickhollow===
Sam joined Frodo on his journey to [[Bree]] and [[Rivendell]], as to outside appearances as Frodo's gardener. He lied that he had the lightest baggage after Frodo complained about the weight of his, and he offered to take more. Sam and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] followed Frodo to his new house at [[Crickhollow]] and when they were encountered by [[Black Riders]] Sam mentioned that one of those was asking his father about Frodo. Later they met one of the [[Wandering Companies]] of Elves; the experience of meeting Elves the first time left him speechless (although they were different than he expected, ''""so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were,""'' as Sam described them<ref name=""short"">{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 87</ref>); the hobbits camped with them and Sam was like in a living dream, mentioning it as one of the most important events of his life. He was enchanted especially by their singing.<ref name=three/> The Elves warned him not to leave Frodo on his journey, and Sam denied he would ever think about it.<ref name=short/>

The next day Sam insisted that Pippin should leave some elven bread for their breakfast. That morning, Sam felt changed, feeling that he had to fulfill a role that lies beyond the Shire, something more important than meeting Elves or [[dragons]] or seeing mountains.<ref name=short/>

At Crickhollow where his and the Conspirators' role was revealed. Merry joined the travellers on their way to Bree.

===Crickhollow to Rivendell===
The hobbits decided to risk travelling through the [[Old Forest]] to avoid Black Riders. There [[Old Man Willow]] put a spell of sleepiness on the four hobbits. Once Merry and Pippin slept by the tree and Frodo bathed his feet in the [[Withywindle]], the willow tree tried to drown Frodo and swallowed Merry and Pippin, but Sam proved the most resistant. He saved Frodo from drowning and tried to start a fire to frighten Old Man Willow but the tree threatened to squeeze the hobbits in two if he did not put it out. They were saved by Tom Bombadil and stayed in his house for two days. Sam was the only hobbit who slept contentedly.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}; {{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>

They passed through [[Barrow-downs]] and came to [[the Prancing Pony]] at Bree where they were joined by ""[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]"". Sam did not trust the ranger at first, but Frodo accepted his help as they could not get to Rivendell otherwise. [[Sauron]]'s spies had opened the stables of the inn and all the mounts went loose, therefore before leaving the village, the company purchased a [[Ponies|pony]] from [[Bill Ferny]]. Sam loved and tended the animal, and named him [[Bill the Pony|Bill]], after his owner. Upon their departure, Bill Ferney saw and taunted them. In response, Sam threw an apple at his head.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}; {{FR|Strider}}; {{FR|Knife}}</ref>

As they came to [[Weathertop]], Sam recited a poem about Gil-Galad that Bilbo had taught him.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, p. 186</ref> After Frodo was stabbed by a Ringwraith, his distrust toward Strider only grew, and he was distraught when he learned that Frodo's wound might subdue him to the Black Riders' will. When the group came to the old place where [[Tom]], [[Bert]], and [[William]] had been turned to stone, he sang ""[[The Stone Troll]]"", an original composition of his, for the others.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>

===Fellowship of the Ring===
When they reached [[Rivendell]], Sam was beside Frodo's bed while he was recovering from the [[Morgul-wound]] he was inflicted on Weathertop and hardly left except to run messages. Once Frodo awoke, Sam led him to join the rest of the party. He had begged to wait on Frodo but was told that for this time he was a guest of honor. When Frodo reunited with Bilbo, Sam sat near near them and listened as they spoke together until he fell asleep.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

The following day, Sam eavesdropped on the [[Council of Elrond]] and remained silent until it was revealed that Frodo would be the [[Ring-bearers|Ringbearer]]. Then Sam was unable to contain himself any longer and revealed himself, asking if Frodo was meant to go alone, to which [[Elrond]] responded that he at least should accompany Frodo as it is impossible to separate them, even when Frodo is invited to a secret council and Sam is not.<ref>{{FR|Many}}; {{FR|Council}}, p. 270-271</ref>

[[File:John_Howe_-_Watcher_in_the_Water.jpg‎|thumb|150px|left|''Watcher in the Water'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Sam insisted on bringing Bill along on the journey, saying he would pine if he did not come. At that point, he lamented that he had not brought rope but found that it was too late to find some now.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 280</ref> Sam was dismayed when he learned they were to enter [[Moria]], and he was even more dismayed that they had to send Bill away when they entered Moria when wolves were about. Sam saved Frodo's life as the [[Watcher in the Water]] tried to seize him with one of its tentacles. As they passed by  fissures and chasms there, Sam once again remarked that he wished he had brought rope. Sam received a scratch along his scalp for his first orc kill in the mines. When Frodo was pinned against the wall by an Orc-spear, Sam hacked and broke the spear-shaft.<ref>{{FR|Journey}};{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

In [[Lothlórien]], the Elves remarked that Sam breathed so loudly that they could shoot him in the dark. Sam was the only one of the four hobbits who had no trouble sleeping upon the Elves' [[flet]], and he remarked that he will go on sleeping whether or not he rolled off in his slumber.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 342, 344</ref> In [[Cerin Amroth]], once the Fellowship was unblindfolded, Sam was surprised by the bright daylight in an Elven realm, and he remarked that he ""thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of"".<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 351</ref>

Sam made a verse in honour of Gandalf's fireworks. He, along with Frodo, looked into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] where he saw trees being felled and that the Old Mill had been replaced by a large red-brick building. Sam considered going back to help those at home, but, being warned by [[Galadriel]] not to let the mirror decide his choices, Sam decided to finish his task with Frodo. At their parting from Lórien, Galadriel [[Gifts of Galadriel|gave]] Sam a [[Sam's garden box|box]] containing earth from her orchard.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}};{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

===Journey to Mordor===
At the [[Falls of Rauros]] Frodo tried to leave the Fellowship secretly by boat, but Sam pursued him and leapt into the water although he could not swim. Thus after the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Sam was the only member of the Fellowship to remain with Frodo.<ref name=""breaking""/>
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - Faramir.png|thumb|250px|""[[Faramir]]"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
When [[Gollum]] joined up with them, Sam remained distrustful of his loyalty to Frodo, and treated him with disdain, and partially (though unintentionally) pushed Gollum to betray Frodo in [[Shelob's Lair]].<ref>{{L|165}}</ref><ref>{{L|96}}</ref>
As Sam, Frodo, and Gollum travelled, Sam began to worry about their food supplies running short and he, unlike Frodo, still thought of the return journey.<ref>{{TT|Passage}}</ref> In [[Ithilien]], he decided to risk a fire and stew rabbit, but he accidentally let it smoke which attracted the attention of [[Faramir]] and his rangers who were also in that region. There, to Sam's delight, he got the chance to see an [[oliphaunt]]. Faramir took the hobbits to [[Henneth Annûn]] where Sam accidentally revealed the purpose of their quest, but Faramir did not hinder it and Sam judged his quality to be ""the very highest."", saying he reminded him of Gandalf.<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}; {{TT|Window}}</ref>

Gollum led the hobbits to the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]], where Sam, in a conversation with Frodo, reflected on whether their adventure would be put in tales and songs to be told by a fireside and noted that they were part of a greater tale than themselves.<ref name=""TT|Stairs"">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>
[[File:Irvin Rodriguez - Samwise the Stouthearted.jpg|thumb|''Samwise the Stouthearted'' by [[:Category:Images by Irvin Rodriguez|Irvin Rodriguez]]]]
Gollum betrayed the hobbits in [[Shelob's lair]], hoping to find the Ring among Frodo's bones once [[Shelob]] had eaten him. However, Sam pierced Shelob's flesh, being the first person ever to have done so, but not before Shelob seemingly killed Frodo.

Grieving for Frodo, Sam took the Ring. At first, he was tempted to go on a quest for revenge on Gollum but instead chose to complete the quest. However, upon learning that Frodo still lived, he rescued him from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and returned the Ring to him. Because he held the Ring for a time, he is considered one of the [[Ring-bearers]].<ref>{{TT|Choices}};{{RK|Tower}}</ref>

Together, Sam and Frodo crossed [[Mordor]] to [[Mount Doom]]. Sam himself carried Frodo up the slope for part of the way. There, Gollum tried to attack the hobbits and Sam spared his life now he had an idea of what it had been like for Gollum to be Ring-bearer—a choice which soon led to success in their quest. After the destruction of the Ring, both Sam and Frodo were honoured by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for their deeds.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}; {{RK|Field}}</ref>

===Later life===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Sam and Rosie Cotton.jpg|thumb|left|''Sam and Rosie Cotton'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the [[War of the Ring]], and the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of Galadriel's soil at the root of each. He was especially shocked that the [[Party Tree]] was cut down and planted a silver nut in the [[Party Field]] where it had once been, and the nut grew into the [[Golden Tree]], the only [[Mallorn]] tree in the Shire.

He married [[Rose Cotton|Rose ""Rosie"" Cotton]] on [[1 May]] {{SR|1420}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> In honor for restoring the Shire his family was given the name [[Gardner Family|Gardner]]. 

They had thirteen children: [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor the Fair]], [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]], [[Rose Gardner|Rose]], [[Merry Gardner|Merry]], [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]], [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]], [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]], [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]], [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]], [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]], [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]], [[Robin Gardner|Robin]], and [[Tolman Gardner|Tolman]]. When Frodo sailed on the [[White Ship]], at the end of the Third Age, Sam inherited Bag End and was entrusted the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].

After [[Will Whitfoot]] resigned his post as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (the largest town in the Shire and the ""unofficial capital""), in {{FoA|6}}, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire, that would be the first of seven consecutive 7-year terms.<ref name=later/> Soon after his election he established a rule of succession and inheritance in situations such as the headless [[Baggins family]], since Bilbo and Frodo went over the sea and was impossible to presume death.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref> During his service, King Elessar appointed the Mayor as a [[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]]. In {{SR|1436}} he met King Elessar on the [[Brandywine Bridge]] and was awarded the [[Star of the Dúnedain]]. In {{SR|1442}} he left [[Tolman Cotton Junior]] as deputy Mayor so that he rode to Gondor with his wife and his daughter Elanor, maid of honour to Queen Arwen, to spend a year there. When Elanor married [[Fastred of Greenholm]], he requested from Thain Peregrin to make him [[Warden of Westmarch]] in {{SR|1462}}.<ref name=later>{{App|Later}}</ref>

After his wife died in {{FoA|61}}, on [[22 September]] Sam left Bag End, and went to the [[Tower Hills]] where he was last seen by Elanor, entrusting to her the Red Book; according to her, he went to the [[Grey Havens]] to sail across the Sea<ref name=later/> and be reunited with Frodo in the [[Undying Lands]].

==Characteristics==
Sam has brown eyes. At some points his hands are described as brown.<ref name=""TT|Stairs""/><ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref>
This could indicate he belongs to the [[Harfoots]], as they are described as having browner skin than the [[Fallohides]], to which breed Merry, Pippin and Frodo belong.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Or it could simply be a tan from years of working outside. His face is often described as red-faced, turning scarlet or blushing. At one point his face is said to have turned white, before flushing scarlet.

Sam was a representative hobbit. He was vulgar and cocksure, but his devotion to Frodo moderated his conceit. For him, his service and loyalty was the measure of his heroicism and bravery.<ref>{{L|246}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Samwise'' means ""simple minded"" or ""half-minded"". ''Gamgee'' is explained as a corruption of the name ''[[Gammidgy]]'', a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the [[Westron]] form of Sam's name '''[[Banazîr]] Galpsi''' (from the complete form [[Galbasi]]) (q.v. for more information).<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

Tolkien's English translation, ''Samwís Gamwich'', could have come to ''Samwise Gamgee'' in modern English.

The [[Sindarin]] version of Samwise is '''''[[Perhael]]'''''. In the [[King's Letter]], contained in the unpublished ""[[Epilogue]]"", King Elessar refers to Sam as ''Perhael (i sennui Panthael estathar aen)'', Sindarin for ""Halfwise (who should rather be called Fullwise).""

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] took the name from ''Gamgee Tissue'', a surgical dressing invented by a 19th century [[Birmingham]] surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee. ""Gamgee"" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool. Here, Tolkien describes why he had chosen that name for his character:
{{blockquote|The choice of Gamgee was primarily directed by alliteration, but I did not invent it. It was caught out of childhood memory, as a comic word or name. It was in fact the name when I was small (in Birmingham) for 'cotton-wool'. (Hence the association of the Gamgees with the Cottons.) I knew nothing of its origin.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 257]]}}

It is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee (who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham Medical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in ''The Lord of the Rings'' but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:
{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Gamgee,<p>It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment when I saw your signature! I can only say, for your comfort, I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic. So that perhaps you will not be displeased at the coincidence of the name of this imaginary character of supposedly many centuries ago being the same as yours.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 184]]}}

He proceeded to send Mr Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's mind, as he recorded in his journal: 
{{blockquote|For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''}}

==Commentary==
In one of his letters, Tolkien described Sam is  as the ""chief hero"" and placed special emphasis on his ""rustic love"" for Rosie.<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> He was known for rescuing Frodo at [[Cirith Ungol]], and carrying him up [[Mount Doom]]. He was one of only two Ring-bearers strong enough to surrender the Ring voluntarily.

The relationship between Frodo and Sam is, in many respects, at the centre of ''The Lord of the Rings''.  Sam's humbleness and plain speaking are frequently emphasised in contrast to Frodo's gentility, and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him ""Mister Frodo"" or ""Master"".  At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death. 

[[Tolkienists]] regard Sam as Frodo's ''[[wikipedia:Batman (army)|batman]]''. In the British Army, a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I First World War]) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman &mdash; he runs errands for Frodo, cooks, transports him (or at least carries him), and carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:
{{blockquote|My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflection of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}

This may be compared to the relationship between [[wikipedia:Don Quixote|Don Quixote]] and his squire, [[wikipedia:Sancho Panza|Sancho Panza]], and the gradual ""Quixotization"" of Sancho.

==In other stories==
In the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', the local police officer is a Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] who - at the behest of [[Gaffer Gamgee]] - seeks to lock up Mr Bliss as a thief for failing to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named Sam.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 62</ref>

:[[Victor Platt]] provided the voice of Sam.

'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:Sam is present at the [[Bilbo Baggins]]' [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|111th birthday party]] and dined with [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry,]] [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Gandalf]]. After Gandalf tells Frodo of the powers of [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]], Merry, Pippin and Sam decide to accompany Frodo to [[Rivendell]]. They set off, pursued by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders.]] Later, they encounter a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and share food, an experience which becomes, in Sam's memory, one of the chief events in his life. Continuing on, they arrive in the [[Old Forest]] and stop for a rest. Pippin is trapped in the [[Old Man Willow]] and Frodo and Sam attempt to help him out. Their efforts are futile until helped by a wandering [[Tom Bombadil]]. The group arrive at [[Bree]] and enter ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]''. They meet with a man named Strider. A letter from Gandalf reveals that his real name is [[Aragorn]] and the Hobbits follow him, as he knows a better route to Rivendell. They arrive in Rivendell and wait for Frodo, who is comatosed for 4 days due to his encounter with the Black Riders. The soon-to-be members of the [[Council of Elrond]] hold a celebratory feast after Frodo recovers. The Council convenes and they decide to form a [[Fellowship of the Ring]], comprising the previous members of their band, Gandalf, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], to take the ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. As they prepare, Sam checks and re-checks his pack to ensure no supplies are missing. He is dismayed by the lack of rope, remembering that he had thought previously about how rope could be useful. The Fellowship depart and take a final look at the House of Elrond. The group sets off, Sam behind Frodo. 

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:[[Michael Scholes]] was the voice of Sam, and [[Billy Barty]] played him in rotoscoped footage. 

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Sam is provided by [[Lou Bliss]].

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:[[Roddy McDowall]] provided the voice of Sam.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:A young [[Bill Nighy|William Nighy]] portrays Sam as a warm and caring person. No dialectical or social difference was made. 

'''1992: ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'':'''
:In the two episodes of ""The Adventures of Tom Bombadil"", [[Jonathan Adams]] portrayed Sam with a very rustic accent.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Samwise Gamgee is provided by Stano Dančiak. Dančiak, though a slightly older actor than the other actors portraying the four hobbits, was well-known for his convincing ""smart everyman"" roles. This is utilised in the series to emphasize that Sam comes from a more ordinary family and humbler social standing than Frodo, Pippin and Merry. Sam is portrayed as resourceful, honest, loyal, caring, and capable of finding bravery when he least expects it. He is also very curious about the world outside of The Shire, including Elven and Dwarven culture and lore. He is addressed almost entirely by his abbreviated name, Sam.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Sam is played by [[Sean Astin]]. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]] majorly diverges Sam and Frodo's story. Frodo, manipulated by Gollum and the One Ring, abandons Sam in Mordor after he offers to carry the Ring. Frodo faces Shelob alone and Sam comes to his rescue after he has already been bound by her webs. Though not noted in dialogue, a page of Frodo's ''The Lord of the Rings'' notes that Sam became the Mayor of Hobbiton.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:[[Scott Menville]] provided the voice for Sam in all but the X-box version; there, [[Cliff Broadway]] took over. The role of Sam is greatly diminished: after being caught eavesdropping by Gandalf, Sam is to be Frodo's companion, but he does not appear again until Frodo reaches [[Farmer Maggot]].

'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Sam is a playable character in several missions: escape from [[Osgiliath]], Shelob's Lair, Cirith Ungol and the Crack of Doom. 

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Samwise only makes a single appearance in the Lothlorien mission.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Unlike most other characters, Frodo and Sam make no appearance in Skirmish battles - they only appear in the storyline campaign.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Sam and other Hobbits are no longer permanent units, they are now a temporary power boost available to Free People forces.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Samwise is first found in Rivendell, preparing for the departure. Later, he is found on [[Cerin Amroth]] in Lothlorien, alongside Frodo. A series of a session plays depicts Sam, Frodo and Gollum's journey through the [[Dead Marshes]], the Pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] and [[Mordor]]. The player later meets Sam and Frodo again at the [[Field of Cormallen]].

:The game's ""Guardian"" class (""Tank"" in MMO terms) is based on Samwise due to the dedication he showed Frodo. Samwise insists that he is no Guardian and not fit to be one - because his heroic deeds have not happened yet. The player has to double-check and discovers that whoever talked of Sam as a great Guardian, apparently had misheard the word ""Gardener"".

'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''
:Samwise appears in the game as a non-playable character, with [[Sean Astin]] reprising his role. He narrates the story of Aragorn to his children when the latter is to come to the Shire.

He died twenty-four years later in {{SR|1432}} at the age of 92, and the [[Master of Buckland|Mastership]] was inherited by his son and heir Meriadoc.<ref name=""App"" />

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Saradoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

In an earlier version of the family tree for the [[Brandybucks]], the name of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s father was '''''Caradoc'''''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, BR 5</ref> Caradoc is a [[Celtic]] name, which means ""kind"" or ""amiable"".<ref name=""Allan"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 204</ref>

In using this name, J.R.R. Tolkien may have been inspired by how in about 1130 AD, a [[Wikipedia:Caradoc of Llancarfan|Caradoc of Llancarfan]] wrote about the life of St. Gildas, the first known text that associated [[King Arthur]] with [[Wikipedia:Glastonbury|Glastonbury]]. A character called Caradoc is the hero in the ''Livre de Caradoc'', which is part of the First Continuation of [[Wikipedia:Chrétien de Troyes|Chretien de Troyes']] ''[[Wikipedia:Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'' from about 1200 AD.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 422</ref>

Caradoc is the name of different characters in Arthurian romance. A ''Caradoc Brecbras'' was apparently a sixth century British ruler with lands in Britain and Brittany.

'''Seredic Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Buckland]].

==History==
Seredic was the son of [[Saradas Brandybuck]]. He married [[Hilda Bracegirdle]] and had three children: [[Doderic Brandybuck|Doderic]], [[Ilberic Brandybuck|Ilberic]] and [[Celandine Brandybuck|Celandine]]. They all attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref>{{app|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Seredic'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=""Translation"">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

In an earlier version of the family tree for the [[Brandybucks]], the name of Seredic was '''''Ceredic'''''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, BR 5</ref>

''Ceredic'' is a real [[Welsh]] name and a variant of the name ''Caradoc''. ''[[Wikipedia:Ceredig|Ceredic Guletic]]'' was the son of ''Cunedag Guletic'', a chief from the fifth century who drove the Goidels/Gaels from North Wales. ''Ceredic Guletic'' ruled a region that was named ''Ceredigion'' after him in Welsh and Cardiganshire in English.<ref name=""Allan"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 205</ref>

'''Ted Sandyman''' was the miller of [[Hobbiton]].

==History==
Ted was a miller after [[Sandyman|his father]]. [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] did not like him, and even less when they were arguing in ''[[The Green Dragon]]'' about the strange news reaching [[the Shire]] from afar. Ted claimed he didn't believe in [[dragons]] (except the green one) derided Sam's story that his [[Hal Gamgee|cousin Hal]] had seen an [[elms|elm]]-like [[Ent|Tree-man]] walking in the [[North Downs]], and the bystanding hobbits laughed and clapped at his remarks. He also laughed with Sam's sadness for the [[Elves]] leaving [[Middle-earth]], saying that nobody saw them doing so, and considered [[Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] ""cracked"" who told Sam about those topics. With that, he drained his mug and went out noisily.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

Ted collaborated with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and [[Saruman|Sharkey]], in exchange for a new and much improved mill. When Sam and the [[Travellers]] returned to Hobbiton, Ted taunted Sam over his grief at seeing the [[The Party Tree|Party Tree]] felled and questioned why he returned. When an angry Sam threatened him, Ted boasted of being a friend to the Boss. When he saw the reinforcements riding up behind the Travelers, Ted sounds a horn to warn [[Sharkey]] but Merry promptly winded the [[Horn of the Mark]] to summon the inhabitants of Hobbiton.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>  Ted's fate afterwards is unmentioned.

==Inspiration==
It is possible [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by the miller's son, George Andrew junior, at [[Sarehole Mill]], Warwickshire, England.

{{quote|There were two millers [at Sarehole Mill], father and son. The old man had a black beard, but it was the son who frightened the boys with his white dusty clothes and sharp-eyed face. Ronald named him 'the White [[Ogres|Ogre]]'. When he yelled at them to clear off they would scamper away from the yard...|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]], pp. 124-5}}

==History==
Tobold Hornblower came from [[Longbottom]] in the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]]. Around {{SR|1070}} ({{TA|2670}})<ref>{{App|TA}}, p. 1870</ref> he started to grow true pipe-weed in his gardens, the first recorded Hobbit to do so.<ref name=Pipeweed/><ref name=Road/> He was not much of a traveller, but in his youth he often visited [[Bree]]. He already had a keen interest in herbs and it is speculated that in one of these visits he learned of [[pipe-weed]] and of [[smoking]] from the [[Bree-hobbits]] (who claim to be the first smokers of that herb).<ref name=Pipeweed/> Toby however never revealed how he came by the weed. 

His name, ""[[Old Toby]]"", was given to a variety of weed that was still popular in the late Third Age.<ref name=Pipeweed/>

==Etymology==
Tobold is a form of ''[[Wikipedia:Theudebald|Theobald]]'' which contains ''theud'' ""people"" and ''bald'' ""bold"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 31</ref> 

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a draft version of the chapter ""[[The Road to Isengard]]"", the name of this hobbit was Elias Tobiasson of [[Mugworth]].<ref>{{WR|1|III}}, p. 36</ref> ''Elias Tobiasson'' is a common name in modern Swedish.<ref>{{WP|Elisa}} and {{WP|Tobiasson}}</ref>

In another early version of the [[legendarium]], Toby was named ''Tobias Hornblower'', and his [[Westron]] name was ''Zāra-tōbi''<ref name=Languages§50>{{PM|Languages}}, Personal names, §50</ref> ''Raspūta''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, On Translation, §42</ref>

In the [[The History of The Lord of the Rings|earliest drafts]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character who became [[Aragorn]] was called '''Trotter''' instead of [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] and was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] instead of [[Man]]. His name was derived from the fact that he had wooden feet or wore wooden shoes after being tortured in [[Mordor]]. 

In some drafts Trotter's real name was '''[[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] [[Boffin Family|Boffin]]''' and was a cousin of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was present at the [[Council of Elrond]] and appointed as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name=comp>{{HM|RC}}</ref>{{rp|xxii}}

Trotter eventually became a Man whose true name was [[Aragorn]]. While in [[Lothlórien]], Tolkien rejected ''Aragorn'' in favor of ''[[Elfstone]]'' and briefly ''[[Ingold]]''.<ref name=comp/>{{rp|xxiv}} However, the name ""Trotter"" continued an alias for Aragorn until the drafting of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was almost complete, not being changed to ""Strider"" until [[1948]], in changes to the drafts of the last chapters.<ref>{{SD|Ic}}, pp. 12-3</ref><ref>{{SD|VIII}}, pp. 76-8</ref>

'''Will Whitfoot''' was the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Whitfoot was elected Mayor at the [[Free Fair]] late in the [[Third Age]], at least as late as {{SR|1413}}.<ref group=note>The date is not given by [[Tolkien]], but is suggested as possible by [[Robert Foster]]. Since the Free Fair is septennial, Will must have been Mayor since the last Fair before {{TA|3020}} (3020-7={{TA|3013|n}}). However, as we are not told that was his first term, it's possible that he might already been serving since {{TA|3006}} or even earlier. See {{HM|Guide}}, p. 428, entry ""Will Whitfoot"".</ref>

He was renowned as being the fattest hobbit in the [[Westfarthing]], and was affectionately referred to as ""Flourdumpling"" after he emerged from the collapse of the [[Town Hole]] covered in chalk. [[Peregrin Took]] later caused a great deal of laughter at the [[Prancing Pony]] when he related that incident to the [[Bree-folk]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> 

He was one of the first victims of the new rule of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] and [[Sharkey]]. He went to protest against Lotho's felling of trees, but was apprehended by [[Ruffians]] on his way to [[Bag End]]. He was locked up in the [[Lockholes]], and Lotho usurped his title.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He was freed after the [[Battle of Bywater]], but was at first unfit for duty as Mayor, so [[Frodo Baggins]] served as Deputy Mayor.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> He was officially restored as Mayor on the next Free Fair, on [[Midyear's Day]] of {{SR|1420}}.<ref name=""Later"">{{App|Later}}</ref>

Will Whitfoot resigned in {{SR|1427}}, and was succeeded by [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref name=""Later""/>

==Etymology==
The name ""Whitfoot"" is derived from ""White foot"".<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>

{{quote|Too bright were the eyes of Arien for even the [[Eldar]] to look on, and leaving [[Valinor]] she forsook the form and raiment which like the [[Valar]] she had worn there, and she was as a naked flame, terrible in the fullness of her splendor.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]""}}

'''Arien''' ([[Quenya|Q]], {{IPA|[ˈari.en]}}) was the [[Maiar|Maia]] who guided the [[Sun]].

== History ==
Arien was originally a spirit of fire whom [[Morgoth|Melkor]] failed to corrupt.<ref name=""S11""/> In the days of the [[Two Trees]], Arien was a [[Maia]] maiden who tended to the golden flowers in the gardens of [[Vána]]. She would water the flowers of Vána with dew gathered from the golden tree [[Laurelin]].<ref name=""LR"">{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 264-5</ref>

After the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], [[Laurelin]] managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. [[Aulë]] crafted a vessel to hold the golden fruit. Arien was chosen by the [[Valar]] to guide the vessel of the [[Sun]] above the airs of [[Arda]] to give light to the World; [[Tilion]], another Maia and one of Oromë's hunters, was chosen to steer the [[Moon]]. The Moon had already traversed the sky seven times before the Sun was finally ready. The first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the [[Pelóri Mountains]] of [[Aman]]. [[Morgoth]] was dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost pit of [[Angband]] and his servants withdrew. He sent up dark clouds of smoke to conceal his land from the light of the Sun.<ref name=""S11"">{{S|11}}</ref>

[[Tilion]] loved Arien and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat.<ref name=""S11""/>

== Etymology ==
''Arien'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Maiden of Sun"".<ref name=Appendix>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''arien''</ref> It is derived from the root ''as-'', seen also in ''[[Áre|árë]]'' (""sunlight""),<ref name=Appendix/> and ''-[[ien]]'' (feminine suffix).

The [[Adûnaic]] name ''[[Ûrî]]'' refers to ""The Lady of the Sun"".<ref>{{SD|3vi}}, p. 426</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== The Book of Lost Tales ===
In the earliest writings, Arien's name was '''''Urwen''''' or '''''Urwendi''''', which translated in ""Maiden of the Sunship"". She was one of Vána's maidens who took care of the tree Laurelin; her task was to water it.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 73</ref> When the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] were destroyed, she offered to steer the Ship of the Sun.<ref name=""LT1Sun"">{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 118</ref>

It was told that Urwendi and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into [[Fôs' Almir|Fôs Almir]] (Faskalan), a bath of flame that would make one pure.<ref name=""LT1Sun""/>

=== Later versions ===
In ''[[Myths Transformed]]'', which changed the timing of the Sun to have been primordial to Arda's inception, [[Melkor]] wanted to claim Arien as a wife,<ref name=Myths>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>{{rp|380–1}} but when she refused him, he attempted to ravish her.<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|405}} However, she released her spirit and burned Melkor leaving him ashen and grey. The Sun was then left without a guide and caused uneven seasons and periods of excessive heat or cold in [[Arda]].<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|381}} In an alternative version, Melkor assaulted her and tainted the light of the Sun, which caused Arien's (''Arie'' in this version) spirit to flee in anguish and wrath from the world. In other abandoned writings, she was a Maia of [[Varda]].<ref name=Myths>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>{{rp|380}}

'''Eönwë''' was the banner-bearer and herald of [[Manwë]], and chief of the [[Maiar]] along with [[Ilmarë]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

== History ==
=== First Age ===
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Eonwe.jpg|thumb|200px|left|""Eonwe"" by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
When [[Eärendil]] reached the shores of [[Aman]], it was Eönwë who first greeted him and summoned him to come before the Powers of [[Arda]].

When [[Manwë]] decided to heed the appeal, he gave [[Sword of Manwë|his sword]] to Eönwë<ref>{{WJ|Last}}, p. 246</ref> and sent him to Middle-earth to fight the [[War of Wrath]], leading the [[Vanyar]].<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> It is said that it was Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth.<ref name=PM>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref> 

When [[Morgoth]] was defeated Eönwë played a key role in the aftermath. He took the two remaining [[Silmarils]] and held them for safekeeping, but when the two remaining [[Sons of Fëanor]] stole them and fled, Eönwë did not allow them to be slain.<ref name=""Earendil""/>

Afterwards, [[Sauron]] paid obeisance to Eönwë and abjured all of his evil deeds. But because Eönwë had not the power to pardon Sauron, he commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwë's judgement. Unwilling to receive humiliation and sentencing, when Eönwë left Sauron hid in [[Middle-earth]] and fell back into evil.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

=== Second Age ===
At the dawn of the [[Second Age]], Eönwë came among the three faithful houses of the [[Edain]] and taught them many things; and they were blessed with wisdom and power and longer [[mortality|life-spans]].<ref name=Akallabeth/>

These Edain eventually became the [[High Men]] of [[Númenor]].<ref name=Akallabeth>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Eonwe.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Eönwë'' is [[Quenya]] in form.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry 'Eonwe'</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma|authorname=[[Helge Fauskanger]]}}</ref> However the ancient [[Loremasters]] knew no [[Elvish]] etymology of the name, suggesting that it is probably of [[Valarin]] origin.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}; note that the original text discusses the character's earlier name, ""Fionwe"", which [[Christopher Tolkien]] considers a mistake.</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/Valarin.htm|articlename=Valarin|authorname=[[Helge Fauskanger]]}}</ref>

See also the [[Quenya]] ending ''[[-wë]]''.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the earlier conceptions of the [[legendarium]], Eönwë was envisioned as the son of Manwë, but as the concept of the [[Valarindi]] (i.e. the Children of the Valar) was abandoned, he was turned into Manwë's herald instead.<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 58</ref>

In some versions Eönwë was the one who would kill Morgoth for his love for [[Arien]] (previously named ''Urwendi''), instead of [[Túrin]].<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 219</ref>

In ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]'', he was the son of [[Tulcas]].<ref>{{SM|2}}</ref>{{rp|§17}}

In both early and later versions of the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' it is revealed that it was Fionwë/Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth at the end of the War of Wrath, but [[Christopher Tolkien]] removed this reference in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', believing that his father intended to diminish his role; however, Christopher Tolkien later felt the omission may have been an error on his part.<ref name=PM/>{{rp|143}}

=== Earlier names ===
In earlier works, such as ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', his name was ''Fionwë'' which translates to ""Son"", from [[Qenya]] ''[[fion]]''.<ref name=LT>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref> This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë.

His other early name, ''Urion'', means ""He of the [[Sun]]"", from ''[[ur]]'' (""the Sun""), ''uru'' (""fire"") or ''urin'' (""blazing""),<ref name=LT/> + the masculine suffix ''[[-ion]]''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}</ref>

'''Ilmarë''' was one of the chiefs of the [[Maiar]], and the handmaiden to Queen [[Varda]]. 

She is only mentioned briefly in the ''[[Valaquenta]]'', where Ilmarë is described along with the Maia [[Eönwë]] who was the banner-bearer and herald of King [[Manwë]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Her name may be related to one of the [[Quenya]] words for ""Starlight"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""[[GIL]]""</ref> Christopher Tolkien has noted that ''Ilmarë'' is related to such words as ''[[Ilmen]]'' and ''[[Ilmarin]]''.<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''ilm-''</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
According to the early stages of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the character that would become Ilmarë was called '''Erinti'''. She was the daughter of [[Manwë]] and Varda, but the concept of the Valar having [[Valarindi|children]] was abandoned and Ilmarë became Varda's handmaiden.<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 58</ref>

She appears in the ''[[Qenyaqetsa]]'', in a rejected early entry. There she is described as: {{quote|the [[Valier|Vali]] of love, music, beauty and purity, who is the same as ''Lotisse'' (or ''Veneste''). She dwells in [[Alalminóre]], and the fairies guard her tower. She and [[Salmar|Noldorin]], and his brother [[Amillo]], alone have left [[Valinor|Valinóre]] to dwell among the Inweli, Noldor, Eldar, and Teleri in [[Tol Eressea]] (Inwenóre). She is also often called ''Akairis'', or bride. She dwells in a ""[[korin]]"" of elms.|''The [[Qenya Lexicon]]'', entry '''ERE- & ESE'''}}<ref name=""Aka"">{{PE|12}}, p. 36</ref>

But, as [[Christopher Tolkien]] points out, her dwelling in Tol Eressëa in a ''korin'' was eventually taken over by the character of [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], and Erinti became the daughter of Manwë and Varda.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 251-252</ref>

=== Early etymology ===
The name '''''Erinti''''' is in [[Qenya]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1984107439.html|articlename=Q. ''Ilmarë'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=27 March 2022}}</ref>

She was also called '''''Lotessë''''' (or '''''Lotissë'''''), being comprised of Qenya ''[[lóte]]'' (""flower"") and the feminine suffix ''-ssë''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2128296051.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Lotesse'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=27 March 2022}}</ref> Another one of her names was '''''Akairis''''' (simply meaning ""bride"" in Qenya).<ref name=""Aka""/>

Among her earlier, rejected names was '''''Helinyetillë''''' (glossed as ""Eyes of Heartsease""<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 39</ref>), a combination of Qenya ''[[helin]]'' (""pansy"") and some variation of ''[[yéta]]-'' (""look at""), later used as a name for [[Nessa]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2992988903.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Helinyetille'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=27 March 2022}}</ref> An early, likewise rejected name '''''Venestë''''' appears next to ''Lotesse'' in the Qenya Lexicon, but its meaning is unclear.<ref name=""Aka""/>

'''Ossë''' was a [[Maiar|Maia]] of the [[Inner Seas]] associated with [[Ulmo]].

==Attributes==
Ossë was a vassal of Ulmo, but he loved the winds and preferred the coasts and isles of [[Middle-earth]]<ref name=""s3"" /> over the deeps of his master. There was some darkness and violence in his spirit, presumably after his seduction by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], and he enjoyed raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo; only his spouse, [[Uinen]], could restrain his wild urges. He obeyed the will of [[Mandos]]<ref>{{UT|1}}</ref> and was a friend of all mariners, but they didn't trust his unpredictable temperament.<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIc}}</ref>

==History==
It was said that during the early days of [[Arda]], Ossë turned to [[Morgoth|Melkor]] for a time, but Uinen brought him back to the loyalty of Ulmo. However, Ossë's wild and wilful nature was still evident despite remaining loyal to Ulmo.<ref name=""vala"" />

During the [[Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to [[Valinor]], Ossë was sent to befriend the [[Lindar]], the clan of the Eldar who lingered by the shores of [[Belegaer]] on their way, and he taught them sea-lore and sea-music. When Ulmo returned with the floating island for them to resume their trip to the west, Ossë (who loved the shores of Middle-earth) did not wish to part with his friends; he persuaded some, like [[Círdan]], to remain there, at the [[Falas]] and the [[Bay of Balar]]. These afterwards became the [[Falathrim]].<ref name=""s3"" /> 

[[File:Steamey - Ossë and the Teleri.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''Ossë and the Teleri'']]

As Ulmo ferried the floating island with [[Olwë]] and his Lindar to [[Eldamar]], they heard Ossë's song and begged Ulmo to stop off the shore, which he did. Ossë fastened the island to the bottom, and it became [[Tol Eressëa]], the lonely isle off the [[Bay of Eldamar]]. However soon the [[Falmari]] of the island longed for the splendour and [[Light of Valinor]] and wished to see their kindred there. Grieving, Ossë submitted to the will of the Valar and Ulmo, and taught them ship-building and offered them [[Swans]] to draw them to Valinor.<ref name=""s3"">{{S|Princes}}</ref>

With his master, Ossë often visited [[Nevrast]] and the feet of Mount [[Taras]] in [[Middle-earth]], and many [[Sindar]] were concentrated to that place.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

After the [[First Kinslaying]], [[Olwë]] called upon Ossë against the [[Noldor]], but he came not, as the Valar did not wish to hinder the [[Flight of the Noldor]] with violence.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref>

After the [[Valar]] pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], Ossë helped guard the shores of [[Beleriand]] to keep the ships of the Noldor from reaching [[Valinor]]. His storms had a part in wrecking all the ships that they sent, and only one [[Elves|Elf]] from among their crews survived, by the will of Ulmo: [[Voronwë]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

In the [[Second Age]] he raised the island of [[Elenna]] ([[Númenor]]) from the depths of the Sea.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

{{familytree/end}}

==Etymology==
At least two explanations exist for the name ''Ossë''. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', it is understood as the [[Qenya]] word ''osse'' (""terror""), deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] GOS (""dread"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 359</ref> 

A later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish origin, deriving from [[Valarin]] ''Oš(o)šai'' (""spuming, foaming"").<ref name=""WJ"">{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 400</ref> The same later note mentions that Ossë's [[Sindarin]] names were '''''Gaerys''''' (also containing the S. element ''gaer'' ""dread"")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''gaer''</ref> and '''''Yssion'''''.<ref name=""WJ"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In older versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as well as the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', Ossë and his spouse [[Uinen]] were Valar in their own right, and often opposed the will of Ulmo.

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Ossë is referred to as ''Saefrea'' (""Sea-ruler""),<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> reflecting his status as a Vala (Fréa).

In that conception, Ossë is the source of the name ''Balar'' in place-names such as [[Cape Balar]], [[Isle of Balar]] and [[Bay of Balar]], which he often visited, and from which all [[Beleriand]] was named.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry BAL</ref><ref>{{GA|2}}</ref>

Ossë had a large house in [[Valmar]] made by [[Ónen]] and [[Oarni]] from pearls with a flour from sea water and roof from foam. He lived there during congregations of Valar or when the noise of the sea tired him.<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref> In ''[[The Tale of the Sun and Moon]]'', it was mentioned that Ossë had green hair and his beard was torn.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>

''Ossë'' was also the name of a [[Tengwa]] similar to Roman c, which apparently had the value ''o''.<ref>{{VT|45}} p.15</ref> However elsewhere, this letter is named ''[[Elwë]]'' and has the value of ''e''. In the [[Mode of Beleriand]] this letter instead has the value ''a''.

His name ''Falman'' from the root FALA (e.g. ''falma'' ""foam"") appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Falman""</ref>

'''Salmar''' was a [[Maia]]<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Salmar""</ref> who entered [[Arda]] with [[Ulmo]]. He was the maker of the [[Ulumúri]], the great horns of Ulmo which produce the music of the sea.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The meaning of the name '''''Salmar''''' in [[Quenya]] is unclear. But, see [[Salmar#Early etymology|below]] for the meaning of his name in the early mythology.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
'''Salmar''', also called '''Noldorin''', was a [[Valar|Vala]] in the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

He entered the world with [[Ulmo]],<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref> and afterwards dwelt in [[Valmar]]. There he would often play music on his harp and lyre, sitting beneath [[Laurelin]], and [[Ómar|Ómar-Amillo]] his twin brother would sing as he played.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 75</ref>

When the Valar decided to oust [[Melko]] from his fortress in [[Utumna]], he joined the rest of them in their attack.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 101</ref> Some time later when the [[Elves]] [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]], he established a friendship with the [[Noldoli]], whom he loved.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 126</ref>

After the [[Two Trees]] were destroyed, it was Salmar who first noticed that in [[Vána]]'s lamentation for them, there was still joy in her voice. When he pointed it out to them, the rest of the Valar gathered there heard the words: ''I-kal'antúlien'' (meaning ""Light hath returned""), since Vána's tears caused a final shoot of Laurelin to spring forth.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 184</ref>

Much later, after the [[Fall of Gondolin]], when the Valar finally decided to wage war on Melko in the [[Great Lands]] and free the enslaved [[Gnomes]], Salmar came with them. In the ensuing [[Battle of Tasarinan]], Salmar barely escaped;<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 154</ref> following his escape he went to the [[Iron Mountains (The Book of Lost Tales)|Iron Mountains]] looking for the Gnomes and to find their place of imprisonment.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 279</ref>

Nothing else is known about his future, except that he eventually returned to Valinor.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 278</ref><ref group=""note"">In an early, rejected entry in ''[[Qenyaqetsa]]'', it is said that Salmar, together with his brother [[Amillo]] and the Vala [[Erinti]] left Valinor to live in [[Tol Eressëa]], being the only three of the Valar that have done so.</ref><ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 36</ref><ref group=""note"">Salmar (Noldorin) was supposed to fight Melko along with [[Tulkas]] in the [[Battle of the Silent Pools]], in which Melko was captured - but his presence there was struck out.</ref><ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, pp. 219-220</ref>

In one text though, it is said that he led the Gnomes back to [[Tol Eressëa]] after the war with Melko.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 67</ref>

=== Early etymology ===
''Salmar'' is a [[Qenya]] name, derived from ''salma'' (""lyre, small harp"").<ref name=Pie/>

=== Other names ===
The [[Gnomish]] cognate of ''Salmar'' is '''''Salvor'''''.<ref name=Pie/>

Likewise, both '''''Noldorin''''' and '''''Lirillo''''' (another name by which he was known by) are also Qenya names: the first probably arising from his association with the [[Noldoli]];<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1050955279.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Noldorin'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 March 2022}}</ref> the second meaning ""Valu of the Song"", containing either ''glîr'' (""a song, poem"") or ''lir-'' (""sing"") + masculine ending ''[[-illo]]''.<ref name=Pie/>

The Gnomish equivalent of ''Noldorin'' is '''''Goldriel''''',<ref group=""note"">''Goldriel'' was replaced by '''''Golthadriel''''', but subsequently both terms were struck out.</ref><ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 22</ref> and that of ''Lirillo'' is '''''Glirlos'''''.<ref name=Pie>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>

Another name for the character was '''''Avlon'''''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 41</ref> It is in Gnomish, but its meaning is unclear.

== Inspiration ==
The characters of Salmar (Lirillo), Ómar (Amillo), and [[Erinti]] were likely inspired by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] himself, his brother [[Hilary Tolkien]], and Tolkien's wife [[Edith Bratt]], respectively.<ref>{{PE|14}}, ""[[The Names of the Valar]]"", ''note 23'', p. 15</ref>

'''Uinen''' was [[Ossë]]'s wife. A [[Maiar|Maia]] of [[Ulmo]], she was known as the '''Lady of the Seas'''.

==Attributes==
Uinen loved and protected all creatures and weeds that live in the sea and brought calm seas. She could calm the tumultous waves of her husband [[Ossë]] and for this she was loved by mariners. She was revered among the [[Ainur]] by the [[Númenoreans]].<ref name=vala>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

It is said that her hair spread through all the surface of water.<ref name=vala/>

== History ==
Early in the history of [[Arda]], Ossë was corrupted by [[Morgoth]] but [[Aulë]] pleaded Uinen to persuade him to return to the service of Ulmo.<ref name=vala/>

The [[Teleri]] of [[Olwë]] had much love for Uinen, as she and Ossë had befriended them at the river [[Sirion]] during the [[Great March]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

Uinen wept for the Teleri mariners after the kinslaying at [[Alqualondë]] and rose a storm that sunk many [[Noldor]] on the stolen [[Swan-ships]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

Considered a protector and bringer of calm seas by the mariners of [[Númenor]], they would cry to her for help, while their respect for the [[Valar]] endured.<ref name=vala/> The [[Guild of Venturers]] were also known as ''[[Uinendili]]''.<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Two explanations exist for the name ''Uinen''. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the first element came from a root UY-. Several other words under this lemma mean ""seaweed"", though the name Uinen itself is not explained.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root UY-</ref> A later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish ([[Valarin]]) origin of unknown meaning.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 404</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that ''Uinen'' contains the element ''[[nén|nen]]'' (""water"").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''nen''</ref> It is unknown if he had access to unpublished manuscripts by his father to corroborate this suggestion or if he speculated on the matter.

'''Agaldor''' was the chieftain of a people living in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.<ref>{{LR|P1II1}}, p. 11</ref>

== History ==
Agaldor was a long-lived [[Men|man]] living among the exiled people in Middle-earth. He was the chief of a people on the edge of the [[Belegaer|Western Sea]] and a [[Seer|twilight-walker]] who often wandered along the beaches and coastlines. One evening upon a rocky shore, He witnessed great clouds that looked similarly to the ""''eagles of the Lord of the West''"". These clouds filled him with [[foresight|foreboding]]. Immediately afterwards, Agaldor left the shore to walk along the beach and behind the land-wall to some houses that have lights inside. The [[Men]] sitting outside waited until he was out of earshot to speak of him. Agaldor [[foresight|foresaw]] among other things, the arrival of the [[Númenóreans]] and the redemption of mankind ahead. Agaldor was later killed by the Númenóreans when they arrived as rebels of the Gods. They took the chieftainship of Agaldor's lands.<ref>{{LR|P1III3}}, pp. 85-7</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Agaldor'' appears to be a [[Noldorin]] name, though it’s meaning is unclear. ''Galdor'' is only glossed in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' as a [[Noldorin]] name from ''Gala'' (""thrive"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""GALA-""</ref> The name ''Amroth'' appears to also be a [[Noldorin]] name possibly comprised of the element ''[[am]]'' (""up"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3705219453.html|articlename=N. ''Amroth'' m.|website=Eldamo}}</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In an alternative version, Agaldor was referred to as '''Amroth''' as he wrestled with [[Thû]].

'''Artaxerxes''' is the wizard, and main antagonist, in ''[[Roverandom]]''. Artaxerxes is described as an old man in ragged trousers wearing a green hat with a blue feather.<ref name=""Roverandom"">{{HM|R}}</ref>{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Originally from [[wikipedia:Persia|Persia]], Artaxerxes ended up in [[wikipedia:Pershore|Pershore]] by mistake.<ref name=""Roverandom""/>{{rp|14}}

After Artaxerxes picks up [[Rover]]'s yellow ball, Rover demands it back without saying ""please"". Rover bites Artaxerxes trousers when he continues to refuse to return the ball; in retaliation, Artaxerxes turns Rover into a toy dog and transports Rover to a toy shop.<ref name=""Roverandom""/>{{rp|1–2}} Although Rover visits the [[Man-in-the-Moon]] with the help of [[Mew]], and seeks the help of the sand-sorcerer [[Psamathos Psamathides]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes Roverandom (as he is now known) to ask Artaxerxes to return him to being a normal dog.

Artaxerxes is living at the bottom of the Deep Blue Sea and is married to the daughter of the Mer-king and has a white Mer-dog called Rover. As a wizard, he has been appointed Pacific and Atlantic Magician and is known as '''PAM'''. All the woes of the mer-people are blamed on PAM, including the emergence of a Sea-serpent. Because he is so deeply unpopular, Artaxerxes leaves with his wife and Roverandom: he takes Roverandom with him as the dog continues to be polite and show faith in his magical abilities.<ref name=""Roverandom""/>{{rp|55 ff}}

Back on land, Artaxerxes turns Roverandom back into a real dog. Wearing a purple velvet suit, Artaxerxes sets up a chocolate and cigarette shop by the beach (selling [[wikipedia:Rock (confectionery)|Pam's Rock]]), whilst his wife gave swimming lessons.<ref name=""Roverandom""/>{{rp|83–7}}

== Etymology ==
[[wikipedia:Artaxerxes|Artaxerxes]] is the name of five Kings of Persia.

[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] note that the abbreviation for Pacific and Atlantic Magaician, PAM, is the same nickname that was given to former British Prime Minister [[wikipedia:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerstone]].<ref name=""Roverandom""/>{{rp|109}}

And now there's you.|Barliman Butterbur in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]""}}

'''Barliman Butterbur''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] who was the owner of ''[[The Prancing Pony]]''.

A short, fat, red-faced [[Men|Man]], he appeared to have had a rather bad memory.<ref name=Sign>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>

==History==
[[The Prancing Pony]] in [[Bree]] was kept by the [[Butterbur Family]] for many generations and Barliman inherited it before the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> He had two [[Bree-hobbits|hobbit]] employees: [[Bob]], who worked in the stables, and [[Nob]], a servant.<ref name=Sign/> 

During the War, [[Gandalf]] wrote a [[Gandalf's letter|letter]] to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and told Barliman to send it to [[Hobbiton]]. Barliman could not find anyone for the task, and eventually forgot the letter altogether, leaving Frodo uncertain as to Gandalf's fate and causing him to start his journey much later than the letter indicated.<ref name=strider>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

He did not remember it until autumn, when Frodo and his companions arrived to stay at the inn, and even then it was long before the connection was made. He did, however, remember to produce [[Aragorn|Strider]]'s credentials.<ref name=strider/>

During the night of the hobbits' stay, the inn was attacked by the [[Black Riders]]. Barliman was dismayed by the terrible events of the night, and was further upset in the morning, when he discovered that the stable-doors had been opened, and all of the [[horses]] and [[ponies]] kept there had escaped. As compensation, he purchased the only [[Bill the pony|pony]] found to be available from [[Bill Ferny]], who demanded at least thrice its proper price. This he gave to the hobbits along with eighteen silver pennies, although the loss of the money was a harsh blow to him. Fortunately, many of the horses had only been set loose, and were found again later. [[Merry]]'s ponies fled to [[Tom Bombadil]], who eventually returned them to Barliman for use at the inn.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

When Gandalf finally arrived at The Prancing Pony, he was furious with Barliman's forgetfulness, but quickly forgave him when he found out the Hobbits were alive. He even went so far as to put a blessing on his beer.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]], Barliman was amazed to learn that Strider, a former patron of the Prancing Pony, had become king of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Barliman means ""barley-man"", a suitable name for an ale-brewer.<ref name=""Nomen"">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ""[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]"" in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', pp. 754-5</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first version of the events at the Prancing Pony, written in pencil, the name of the innkeeper was '''Timothy Titus''', ""a very small man"" whose friends called him '''Tim Tip''',<ref>{{B|IV}}, Chapter VI: The Storyteller</ref> from an old incomplete oral story by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 135 (entry ""?1926-?1930"")</ref> This character bore no resemblance to Mr. Butterbur.  Timothy Titus was written over in ink with the name '''Barnabas Butterbur''' in Tolkien's manuscript and was created as a very fat Hobbit before he was subsequently changed into the man called Barliman.<ref>{{RS|1VIIIN}}, note 3</ref>

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Barliman was voiced by [[Alan Tilvern]].

'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC Radio's The Lord of the Ring]]'':'''
:[[James Grout]] provided the voice of Butterbur. Grout played what is a fairly minor character with great panache, and much of his garrulous dialogue from the book is intact, especially in the longer 1982 episodes.  Butterbur also appears in the penultimate instalment when the returning company stop off at Bree.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:He is played by [[David Weatherley]], although the character is not named and most of his scenes from the book (including the reference to Gandalf's letter) are not in the film.

'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Barliman Butterbur is provided by Július Satinský.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Barliman is a non-playable character that can be found at [[the Prancing Pony]]. The player meets with him during Volume I ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar|Shadows of Angmar]]'', Book I: ""Stirrings in the Darkness"".

'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''
: Butterbur appears briefly at the start of the Bree mission, where he informs Aragorn that he might learn the location of the Hobbits by asking around town.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Barliman Butterbur is the inn-keeper, and can be found behind the bar in the Prancing Pony. He tells the player news about troubles in the south, and [[Southerners]] who have come lately to Bree, and information about the Prancing Pony, that it almost exists as long as Bree.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

[[File:The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug - Butterbur, Sr.jpg|""Butterbur, Sr."" in ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''|right|thumb|150px]]
'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Though he does not appear in the film, a character credited as ""Butterbur, Sr."" appears in its prologue running the bar at the Prancing Pony -- apparently meant to be Barliman's father, thus implying the inn was a family-run establishment.

Elmir and Ermon were awakened by an [[Elf]] called [[Nuin]], one of the [[Ilkorindi]], who, against the warnings of the wizard [[Tû (king of the Hisildi)|Tû]] his lord, liked to wander far from his home in [[Palisor]] all the way to Murmenalda, and in one of these wanderings he stumbled upon the sleeping bodies of [[Men]], the second children of [[Ilúvatar]].

There, after waking Elmir and Ermon, Nuin taught them speech, and they, alone of all Men, witnessed the [[Sun]] [[The Tale of the Sun and Moon|rising in the West and setting in the East]]; sometime after, the rest of mankind awoke as well, and Nuin, Elmir and Ermon taught ''them'' speech in return - and the race of Men ""grew in stature, and gathered knowledge of the [[Hisildi|Dark Elves]]"".<ref name=""Mur""/>

Afterwards, a servant of [[Melko]] called [[Fankil]] turned most Men against the Elves, and in the [[War of Palisor|first war]] between Elves and [[Goblins]], it is said that ''only'' the people of Ermon fought on the side of the Elves,<ref name=""Mur""/> possibly implying that, either Elmir and his folk fought on the side of Melko, or that Elmir died before the war.

Ultimately, however, Elmir's fate is unknown.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Elmir'' might be in [[Ilkorin]], according to [[Christopher Gilson]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>[[Christopher Gilson]], ""His Breath Was Taken Away: Tolkien, Barfield, and Elvish Diction"", in {{TS|14}}, p. 37</ref>

Afterwards, a servant of [[Melko]] called [[Fankil]] turned most Men against the Elves, and in the [[War of Palisor|first war]] between Elves and [[Goblins]], only the people of Ermon fought on the side of the Elves. Following the war, Men were scattered in all directions, some of them heading for ""eastern deserts and the southern forests"", but some Men, especially Ermon and his folk, went west, along with some of the Ilkorindi.<ref name=""Mur""/>

Ermon, accompanied by an Elf called [[Tareg]], eventually arrived to the river [[Sirion]] in the northwest of the [[Great Lands]], where they met the exiled [[Gnomes]], who were about to prepare for a war with Melko. There, they joined forces with them, and, at a place called [[Gorfalong]], fought a [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad#Other versions of the legendarium|great battle]] with Melko and his forces, many of whom were Men corrupted by him.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 240</ref>

Ermon's eventual fate is unknown, but he evidently left descendants, since in one outline, [[Ing]] King of [[Luthany]] was said to be one of them.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 305</ref><ref group=""note"">According to another text, Ing was the descendant of ''both'' Ermon and Elmir.</ref>

He was akin to [[Túrin|Turambar]] himself through [[Morwen|Mavwin]]. When Turambar came to [[Brodda's hall]] and murdered [[Brodda|the lord]] in vengeance, Orlin was one of the few men present there who tried to seize Turambar, being the only one killed. When [[Airin]] appeared and the people waited for her judgement, she explained Turambar had indeed commited a grave crime killing someone akin to his mother and in a hall of feast, but that, as it was in his defence, he would only be condemned to exile.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 90</ref>

{{Quote|In [[Eregion]] the craftsmen of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], the People of the Jewel-smiths, surpassed in cunning all that have ever wrought, save only [[Fëanor]] himself; and indeed greatest in skill among them was Celebrimbor, son of [[Curufin]]...|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]""}}

'''Celebrimbor''' was the [[Elves|elf]] that forged the [[Three Rings]], mighty artifacts whose existence shaped the history of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s of [[Middle-earth]]. As a craftsman, he was second only to [[Fëanor]],<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> his grandfather.<ref name=PMXnotes/>

==History==
=== First Age ===
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|left|''Celebrimbor'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
Celebrimbor was born in [[Aman]] during the [[Years of the Trees]]. Among [[Fëanor]]'s [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]], Celebrimbor's father [[Curufin]] was the chief inheritor of Fëanor's temperament and skills in craftsmanship.<ref name=Curufin>{{PM|XI7}}, p. 352</ref> In turn, Curufin passed these skills – but not this temper – on to Celebrimbor.<ref name=PMXnotes/>

Following the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Celebrimbor followed Fëanor into exile in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=Nol>{{S|9}}, p. 37</ref> His unnamed mother remained behind with the people of [[Finarfin]].<ref name=PMXnotes/> Celebrimbor did not swear the [[Oath of Fëanor]]. It is unknown whether he took part in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. It is also unknown whether he crossed the [[Belegaer]] in one of the stolen Falmari ships or if he followed [[Fingolfin]] across the [[Helcaraxë]].

Celebrimbor's whereabouts in Beleriand in the early [[Years of the Sun]] are unattested, but later events suggest that he dwelt with his father Curufin and uncle [[Celegorm]] in their realm of [[Himlad]].<ref>{{S|14}}, p. 58</ref> The realm lasted until the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}}, in which [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]]. After this defeat, Curufin and Celegorm fled to the southwest with many of their people, including Celebrimbor,<ref name=PMXnotes/> and took refuge with [[Finrod Felagund]] in his realm of [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|18}}</ref>

Though they were but refugees and guests in Nargothrond, Curufin and Celegorm sought power, and they quickly gained great influence among the people. For his part, Celebrimbor was not involved in his father's schemes and came to love Finrod.<ref name=PMXnotes/> 

In {{FA|465}},<ref>{{GA|192}}, p. 65</ref> the brothers' [[Quest for the Silmaril|political machinations]] forced Finrod to surrender his crown to [[Orodreth]] and leave his realm. Their dominance would prove short-lived. Later that same year, captives freed from the dungeons of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] returned to Nargothrond and spoke against the brothers, revealing their treachery and turning the people against them. Orodreth would not suffer them to be slain and so exiled them from the realm.<ref name=Oro>{{S|19}}</ref>

When Celebrimbor learned the truth of his father and uncle's actions, he was ""aghast"" and parted ways with them. He was not subject to their exile and did not voluntarily follow them.<ref name=PMXnotes/> His whereabouts for the remainder of the First Age are unknown.

=== Second Age ===
{{expansion}}
==== Establishment of Eregion and the forging of the Rings of Power ====
The whereabouts of Celebrimbor during the early years of the [[Second Age]] are uncertain, but at some point, he became a great friend to [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]],<ref name=PMXnotes/> and in {{SA|750}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 750, p. 1083</ref> Celebrimbor with many others of the exiled Noldor followed them to establish the realm of [[Eregion]] near to [[Khazad-dûm]], the mansions of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]]. This they did due to the discovery of ''[[mithril]]'' in the surrounding mountains.<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}, p. 1082</ref>

Eventually, a great friendship arose between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, such that was never before seen, and Celebrimbor became the [[Lord of Eregion]]<ref name=SA/> and the greatest of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], ""People of the Jewel-smiths"", who in their skill were second only to Fëanor, Celebrimbor's grandfather. There, Celebrimbor befriended [[Narvi|Narvi the Dwarf]],<ref name="":0""/> who built the [[Doors of Durin]], and Celebrimbor inscribed the words upon it.<ref name=Dark>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 306</ref>

However, in {{SA|1200}}, [[Sauron]], under the fair guise of ''[[Annatar]]'', came to Eriador posing as an emissary of the [[Valar]]. He was rejected by [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], in [[Lindon]] (where he was not even admitted to), but although Galadriel did not trust him and treated him with scorn, he was nonetheless accepted by the smiths of Eregion, for Celebrimbor desired in his heart to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor. Galadriel and Celeborn were eventually stripped of their authority in Eregion, and this was largely due to the machinations of Sauron. Galadriel, with her daughter [[Celebrían]], departed for the Elvish realm of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]], while Celeborn, due to his dislike of all Dwarves and not wanting to cross through their mansions in Khazad-dûm, remained behind in Eregion, and he was largely ignored by Celebrimbor and Annatar thereafter.<ref name="":0"" />

In c. {{SA|1500}}, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain reached the height of their skill under the instruction of Sauron and began forging the [[Rings of Power]].

==== The War of the Elves and Sauron and death ====
Celebrimbor was ignorant of Sauron's true intentions, and he was unaware that Sauron had incorporated a binding magic into the rings. Furthermore, in secret, Sauron forged the [[One Ring]], a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth by controlling those that wore all the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the [[Rings of Power]] and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. Aside from the One Ring, the greatest rings were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the Three Rings of the Elves, and a chief source of the beauty that came about in the [[Third Age]]. Celebrimbor named them [[Vilya]], [[Narya]], and [[Nenya]] after the Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water. He sent the three rings to Elf-lords for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to [[Durin III]] of Khazad-dûm.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1076</ref>

Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the Three. Celebrimbor died from his torment, and his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Sauron attacked the Grey Havens.<ref name="":0"">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Celebrimbor.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Celebrimbor'' is in [[Sindarin]], meaning ""Silver-fist""; it is comprised of the elements ''[[celebrin]]'' (""like silver in hue or worth"") + ''[[paur]]'' (""fist, closed hand""),<ref name=Tel>{{PE|Eldarin}}, entry ''S'' '''Celebrimbor''', p. 42</ref> with the ending ''-bor'' in ''Celebrimbor'' being a suffixal form of ''paur''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3689389101.html|articlename=S.

Its [[Quenya]] cognate is '''''Telperinquar''''' or '''''Telpinquar'''''.<ref name=Tel/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'' ===
The character of Celebrimbor first appears in a draft chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' called ''[[The Mines of Moria (chapter)|The Mines of Moria]]'' (from [[1939]]<ref>{{CG|C}}, entry '''August-autumn 1939''', p. 229</ref>),<ref name=Ret>{{RS|Moria}}, p. 449</ref> which would later become the chapter ''[[A Journey in the Dark]]'' in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as published.<ref group=note>Before they were envisioned as being made by Celebrimbor in ''The Lord of the Rings'', the [[Rings of Power]] were imagined as creations of [[Fëanor]] himself.</ref><ref>{{TI|Galadriel}}, p. 255</ref>

There, as in ''The Lord of the Rings'', he is only mentioned by name when [[Gandalf]] was reading the inscription on the Doors of Durin:<ref name=Ret/>

{{blockquote|""They merely say: The Doors of Durin Lord of Moria. Speak friends and enter. And underneath very small and now faint is: [[Narvi#Other versions of the legendarium|Narfi]] made them. '''Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs'''.""}}

The name ''Celebrimbor'' was also added to ''[[The Etymologies]]'', a linguistic work from the late 1930s, at around the same time. There, the name is given under the root [[KWAR]] (""clutching hand, fist""), and Celebrimbor's name was explained as meaning ""Silver-fist"" in [[Noldorin]] (which was a precursor language to [[Sindarin]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''KWAR-''', p. 366</ref>

However, even though no origin of Celebrimbor was published until the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in [[1966]], Tolkien did in fact write one in the 1950s, which can be found in the next section of the article.

=== ''Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn'' and ''The Elessar'' ===
The first known origin story of Celebrimbor was written by Tolkien in c. [[1959]], occurring in a text called ''[[Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn]]''. There, Celebrimbor was described as an [[Gondolindrim|Elf]] of [[Gondolin]] (and one of [[Turgon]]'s ""greatest artificers""), who, after the end of the First Age and the overthrow of Morgoth, became a follower of Celeborn and Galadriel,<ref name=Con>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 235</ref> who were regarded as the ""High Lord and Lady of all the Eldar of the West"".<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 347</ref>

After the establishment of Eregion,<ref group=note>This text states that the building of Ost-in-Edhil, the capital of Eregion, was begun in {{SA|750}}.</ref> Celebrimbor became the ""chief craftsman of Eregion"" with an ""almost 'dwarvish' obsession with crafts"", and befriended the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, of whom a dwarven craftsman called [[Narvi]] was his greatest friend<ref name=Con/> - from that friendship both Eregion and Khazad-dûm profited greatly.

In c. {{SA|1000}}, Sauron established himself in [[Mordor]], and sent emissaries to Eriador, before finally appearing there himself, in his fairest form, in {{SA|1200}}. However, he was rejected by Gil-galad in [[Lindon]], and after heading to Eregion, was likewise rejected by Galadriel and Celeborn, the original rulers of Eregion in this conception of the legendarium.<ref name=Ceb>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 236</ref>

But even though Celeborn and Galadriel (who he perceived to be his chief obstacle) rejected him, Sauron, posing as an emissary of the Valar, nonetheless managed to convince Celebrimbor and the rest of the Noldorin smiths of Eregion, who by this time have formed a powerful guild called the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], to accept his help in the forging of the Rings of Power;<ref name=Bor>{{UT|Concerning}}, pp. 236-7</ref> here Tolkien states that the story of Fëanor was repeated.

Therefore, Celebrimbor and his followers (under the influence of Sauron) rebelled against Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref group=note>In this text, it is said that Celebrimbor was ""secretly anxious to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor"".</ref> and, sometime between {{SA|1350}} and {{SA|1400|n}}, Galadriel withdrew from Eregion and went to [[Lórinand]] (which would later be known as ''Lórien''), via Khazad-dûm, and took up rule there. However, Celeborn, owing to his distrust of the Dwarves, remained in Eregion ""disregarded by Celebrimbor"".

In c. {{SA|1500}}, Sauron left Eregion, some time after the Mírdain started crafting the Rings of Power.

When in c. {{SA|1600}} Sauron forged the [[One Ring]], Celebrimbor finally discovered his true intentions, and he repented. Therefore he went to Lórinand to seek Galadriel's advice;<ref group=note>Tolkien wrote here that they ""should have destroyed all the Rings of Power at this time, 'but they failed to find the strength'"".</ref> she advised him to hide the [[Three Rings]] (which were the three Great Rings made solely by Celebrimbor) and send them away far from Eregion, never to be used, after which Celebrimbor gave one of them ([[Nenya]]) to her keeping. Following that, he entrusted the other two rings ([[Vilya]] and [[Narya]]) to Gil-galad in Lindon.<ref group=note>According to this text, at this time, Gil-galad gave Narya to [[Círdan]]; however, according to a later note, it is said that Gil-galad kept both rings until the [[War of the Last Alliance]].</ref>

After Sauron learned of Celebrimbor's repentance, he invaded Eriador and besieged Eregion. And even though help was on the way, from Celeborn with his son [[Amroth]] and the [[Nandor]] of Lórinand, along with the Dwarves of Moria, ''and'' from an army sent by Gil-galad under the command of Elrond from the west, it did not arrive in time. Therefore:

{{blockquote|Sauron breaks into Eregion and lays it waste. Celebrimbor is slain personally by Sauron, but Sauron does not get the Three Rings. His wrath now blazes. Elrond with all (the few) refugees from Eregion he can gather fight a vanguard action and draw away N.W. He founds a stronghold in Imladris.}}

And:

{{blockquote|When Celeborn heard of onset of Sauron (fearing to keep the Three Rings himself) he sent one to Galadriel in Lórinand by Amroth. Celeborn makes a sortie and breaks out and joins Elrond but cannot get back.}}

==== ''The Elessar'' ====
In a text titled ''[[The Elessar]]'', written at around the same time as that of ''Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn'',<ref name=Ele>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 251</ref> Tolkien gives two in-universe accounts of the creation of the [[Elfstone|Elessar]], a gem-stone of which it was said that:<ref name=Sar>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 249</ref>

{{blockquote|...those who looked through this stone saw things that were withered or burned healed again or as they were in the grace of their youth, and that the hands of one who held it brought to all that they touched healing from hurt.}}

According to one of these accounts, the original Elessar was made by [[Enerdhil]], a renowned smith of [[Gondolin]], who gave it to [[Idril]] the daughter of King [[Turgon]], who in turn gave it to [[Eärendil]] her son - and so the original Elessar past into the West with him on his voyage to [[Aman]].<ref name=Sar/>

Many years later,<ref group=note>Before Sauron ""deluded the smiths of Eregion"".</ref> Galadriel confided in Celebrimbor that she lamented the inevitable decay and diminishment of the lands of Middle-earth, and wished that there was some way to counteract it - because even though she was able to go West to [[Tol Eressëa]], she was still too proud to do so.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 250</ref>

{{blockquote|'I would have trees and grass about me that do not die - here in the land that is mine', she answered. 'What has become of the skill of the Eldar?' And Celebrimbor said: 'Where now is the [[Elfstone|Stone of Eärendil]]? And Enerdhil who made it is gone.' 'They have passed over Sea,' said Galadriel, 'with almost all fair things else. But must then Middle-earth fade and perish for ever?'}}

Therefore Celebrimbor, who loved Galadriel (though she ""turned to Celeborn of the Trees"") began to work on making the second Elessar. Because unbeknownst to Galadriel, Celebrimbor used to be an Elf of Gondolin, and was a friend of Enerdhil, even though Enerdhil ""in most things outrivalled him"".<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, pp. 250-1</ref>

However, even though Celebrimbor managed to make this stone even more ""subtle and clear"" than that of Enerdhil, due to the ever present influence of Morgoth on [[Arda]] even after his defeat in the First Age, the gem's light had less power than the original - because that one captured the light of the [[Sun]] in its youth.<ref name=Ele>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 251</ref>

Nonetheless, the Elessar of Celebrimbor was deemed the greatest of his works, save the [[Three Rings]] only, and:<ref name=Ele/>

{{blockquote|Wielding the Elessar all things grew fair about Galadriel, until the coming of the Shadow to the Forest. But afterwards when Nenya, chief of the Three, was sent to her by Celebrimbor, she needed it (as she thought) no more, and she gave it to Celebrían her daughter, and so it came to Arwen and to Aragorn who was called Elessar.}}

In the concluding words of the text, however, Tolkien rejected the notion that the first Elessar was made by Enerdhil. Instead, ''both'' Elessars were to be creations of Celebrimbor.

According to the final paragraph of ''The Elessar'' text, the original Elessar of Celebrimbor (which Idril received) went into the West with Eärendil, and the second one (which Galadriel received) was made by him sometime before Sauron's appearance in Eregion.<ref name=Ele/>

=== ''Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals'' ===
According to a late text called ''[[Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals]]'', from c. [[1968]], Tolkien changed Celebrimbor's origins from that of a grandson of Fëanor to that of a Teler of Aman (Falmar).<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta>{{VT|47a}}, entry '''4. Q. quár''', p. 8</ref><ref name=Nom>{{NM|P2iii}}, p. 178</ref>

In that version of his history, Celebrimbor, the ""heroic defender of Eregion in the Second-age war against Sauron"", was depicted as a great silver-smith who accompanied Celeborn in his exile to Middle-earth from Aman, along with two other Telerin elves.

During the Second Age, he moved to Eregion due to the rumours of a ""marvellous metal"" found in Moria, which he named ''[[mithril]]''.<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta/><ref name=Nom/> It is said in the text that:

{{blockquote|In the working of this he became a rival of the Dwarves, or rather an equal, for there was great friendship between the Dwarves of Moria and Celebrimbor, and they shared their skills and craft-secrets.}}

However, according to his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], Tolkien most probably forgot the fact that he included Celebrimbor's origins as a descendant of Fëanor in the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' ([[1966]]), and that, had he remembered it, he would not have changed it.<ref name=Eld>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 7, pp. 318-9</ref>

==== Etymology ====
According to this version of his history, the name ''Celebrimbor'' is likewise in Sindarin. However, in this text, ''Celebrimbor'' is a [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] version of his original [[Telerin]] name '''''Telperimpar''''' (with '''''Tyelpinquar''''' being its Quenya cognate).

The name was derived from the root [[KWAR]] (""press together, squeeze, wring""), whose derivatives were: ''[[quár]]'' ([[Quenya|Q]]), ''[[pār]]'' ([[Telerin|T]]) and ''[[paur]]'' ([[Sindarin|S]]).

The text also says that it was a common name among the Teleri of Aman, who were renowned silver-smiths.<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta/><ref name=Nom/>

=== ''Of Dwarves and Men'' ===
In a late text that Christopher Tolkien called ''[[Of Dwarves and Men]]'' (from c. [[1969]]),<ref>{{PM|XIntro}}, p. 295</ref> Tolkien changed Celebrimbor's origins yet again.<ref name=Eld/>

Here, Celebrimbor is depicted as a [[Sinda]] who claimed descent from [[Daeron]],<ref name=Dwa>{{PM|X}}, p. 297</ref> a famous [[Minstrels|minstrel]] and the chief loremaster of Doriath.<ref>{{S|10}}, p. 43</ref> In that text, it is explained how in Eregion, due to the influence of Celebrimbor, the ancient [[Angerthas|runic alphabet]] devised by Daeron was, along with [[Tengwar]], also known and used.

And even though in Eregion these Runes were used mostly on formal occasions, due to the contact between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, and because of the greater ease with which the Runes could be carved on stone, the Longbeard Dwarves adopted and modified them for their own use.<ref name=Dwa/>

:Lord Celebrimbor is portrayed by [[Charles Edwards]] as one of the central characters of the series.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Alice Jones]]|articleurl=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/amazon-the-rings-of-power-series-first-look|articlename=Amazon’s Lord of the Rings Series Rises: Inside The Rings of Power

=== Games ===
'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''
:Celebrimbor plays a major role in the video game, serving as a [[wraith]] who is bound to an [[undead]] [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger]], [[Talion]], by the will of [[Sauron]]. He is voiced by [[Alister Duncan]]. He is also the main protagonist of the ''Bright Lord'' expansion, where he is revealed to have stolen the One Ring from Sauron at some point in the Second Age, and intended to use it to turn the Dark Lord's own weapons against him. However, he is corrupted by the power of the Ring and doomed to never see the Undying Lands. Though he defeats Sauron in battle, Sauron still managed to reclaim the Ring and banish Celebrimbor's spirit to an eternity as a wraith in the Unseen world. Bound to Talion, Celebrimbor grants him Elven powers to help him seek revenge for the death of his wife and son.

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:Celebrimbor uses [[Talion]] to create a new ring of power so they can dominate the orc forces of [[Sauron]]'s army to create one in their own service. With their army amassed they travel Sauron's Road to destroy the Dark Lord. On their way, Talion comes up against the [[Nazgûl]] [[Isildur]] and decides to free Isildur from life as a servant to Sauron. Celebrimbor, angry that Talion vanquished Isildur rather than adding his power to their army, reveals that he intends to replace Sauron instead of destroying him. Talion refuses to help him in his quest for power, so Celebrimbor removes the new ring from him. With their bond lost, Talion begins to bleed profusely and die. Celebrimbor convinces Eltariel, an Elven assassin of [[Galadriel]], to wield the new ring and continue on to defeat Sauron. During their battle, Sauron is able to overpower them and cut Eltariel's fingers off along with the new ring. Sauron then absorbs Celebrimbor and together they become the flaming Eye of Sauron atop [[Barad-dûr]].

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Celebrimbor appears in several flashback sequences, depicting his encounter with the ""Lord of Gifts"", the initial idea of creating the Rings of Power and his final doomed stand during the [[Sack of Eregion]]. His body was wrestled from Sauron's servant by a brave elf who cast herself into the waters along with it to deny the Enemy his prize.

'''Glorfindel''' was a [[Noldor|Noldo]] and one of the mightiest [[Elves]] of [[Middle-earth]]. During the [[First Age]], he was the lord of the [[House of the Golden Flower]] of [[Gondolin]], and died fighting a [[Balrog]]. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to Middle-earth in the [[Second Age]], acting as an emissary of the [[Valar]], on a similar mission to the [[Wizards|Istari]] who were to come several years later.

==History==
===Early history===
Glorfindel was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]]. During the [[Exile of the Noldor]], he was of the host of [[Turgon]]. Glorfindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]].<ref name=""PoME-LW"">{{PM|Last}}, ""Glorfindel I & II""</ref>{{rp|380}}

===Life in Gondolin===
After the Return of the Noldor to [[Middle-earth]], Glorfindel's history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], one of the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|noble houses]] of [[Gondolin]]. He was dearly loved by all the [[Gondolindrim]].

[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
He followed [[Turgon]] who surprisingly came to fight in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. When the war turned against the [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]], Turgon's and [[Fingon]]'s forces retreated to the [[Pass of Sirion]] with Glorfindel and [[Ecthelion]] guarding their flanks.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel's Bane.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorfindel's Bane'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
In the year {{FA|510}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> [[Morgoth]] sent a great force against Gondolin, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', and long remembered by the elves. Glorfindel managed to escape the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with the [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]], and after crossing [[Tumladen]] they reached the [[Cirith Thoronath]], a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of [[Orcs]] led by a [[Balrog]]. The [[Eagles]] came to help them, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. [[Thorondor]] rescued Glorfindel's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, [[War of Wrath|until the world changed]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

===Re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth===
Glorfindel's spirit passed to the [[Halls of Waiting]], where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against [[Morgoth]]. But because of Glorfindel's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Tuor and Idril, Manwë allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in Valinor for many years in the company of the Eldar and the [[Maiar]], the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of [[Olórin]], a Maia with special concern for Middle-earth.<ref name=""PoME-LW"" />{{rp|380–381}}

Eventually, [[Manwë]] sent him across the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Second Age]]. He possibly came as early as {{SA|1200}}, but more likely in {{SA|1600}},<ref name=""PoME-LW"" />{{rp|381–382}} at the same time as the [[Blue Wizards]].<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, ""The Five Wizards"", p. 384</ref> If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after [[the One Ring]] had been forged, [[Barad-dûr]] built, and [[Celebrimbor]] dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Glorfindel's mission was to aid [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] in the struggle against [[Sauron]].<ref name=""PoME-LW"" />{{rp|382}} He may have played a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the war in [[Eriador]] and the other struggles of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]]. His part, though great, was mostly overlooked by the histories, because his immense, angelic power was not usually displayed openly.

===Third Age===
Over time, as the few remaining great Elves of Middle-earth took ship to Aman or fell one by one, only [[Galadriel]], [[Celeborn]], [[Elrond]], and [[Círdan]] were left of the Wise. Glorfindel took a more active role, leading the Elven forces in the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Upon the humiliation of [[Eärnur]] before the [[Witch-king]], Glorfindel bade him not pursue, and prophesied that the wraith would not fall by the hand of man.<ref>{{App|A1iv}}</ref> Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the [[Westlands]] before the [[War of the Ring]].
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Glorfindel.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
During the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from [[Rivendell]] by Elrond to search for the [[Ring-bearer]]. Elrond had chosen him partially because Glorfindel did not fear the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], as he had great presence in both the [[Seen]] and [[Unseen]] worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Glorfindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], and his friend [[Aragorn]] with him. Glorfindel put Frodo on his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Frodo to safety across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Glorfindel, expecting the flood that protected Rivendell to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>

After this adventure, he helped bear Frodo to Rivendell, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Glorfindel attended the [[Council of Elrond]], playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of [[Tom Bombadil]] and other matters with authority. Glorfindel stood beside Elrond and Gandalf as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Glorfindel suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Gandalf noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], but as his friend Gandalf said, Glorfindel's power would be of little use against the might of [[Mordor]], on a mission of secrecy.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]] nothing is said of Glorfindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Elrond's company to the Wedding of Elessar.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the [[Elves]] was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the [[Three Rings]] and [[the One Ring]]. Or he may have remained in Middle-earth for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for [[Valinor]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Glorfindel.mp3|Ardamir}}
With the development of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name ''Glorfindel'' had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same. 

The early [[Gnomish]] conception meant ""Goldtress"" or ""Goldlocks"". At this stage of the legendarium, [[Tolkien]] considered many other variants, like ''Glorfinn'' or ''Glorfing''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry ""Glorfindel""</ref> [[Qenya]] cognates were '''''Laurifindl''''' or '''''Kulufindl'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>

At the [[Noldorin]] stage, the name was composed of the words ''[[glaur]]'' (""gold"") + ''findel/finnel'' (""braided hair""),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""[[LAWAR]]"", ""SPIN""</ref> but it is not properly glossed.

In the final [[Sindarin]] conception, ''Glorfindel'' meant ""Golden-hair"", from ''glaur'' (""gold"") + ''findel'' (""head of hair"").<ref name=""Eldarin"">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|17}} It was supposedly derived from the [[Quenya]] form '''''Laurefindelë'''''.<ref name=""Eldarin"" />{{rp|119}} Tolkien also created a [[Primitive Quendian]] version: ''Malaphindë'' (""Goldilocks""), which is mentioned as an ''[[anessë]]'' (a given name).<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 86</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early legendarium===
====''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''====
The most detailed text about the deeds of Glorfindel during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]"", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. There he is described as the chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine ""as a field in spring"", while his arms were [[Uncommon words#D|damascened]] with ""cunning gold"".<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}} 

Glorfindel witnessed the coming of [[Tuor]] and later the [[Fall of Gondolin]]. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Glorfindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the [[Great Market]] from the advancing [[Orcs]]. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing [[Dragons|dragon]] came and levelled their ranks. Glorfindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the [[House of the Harp]] arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader [[Salgant]], ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the [[Square of the King]], one of the last of the houses to be driven in.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|182}} 

As many of the lords had fallen, [[Ecthelion]] was wounded, [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] was engaged, and [[Egalmoth]] had not yet arrived, Glorfindel joined Tuor in leading the defence of the King's Square. When Egalmoth arrived, bringing with him many women and children, he took over Glorfindel's job in going from place to place, strengthening the defences. Glorfindel presumably threw himself once more into the thick of the fight. But even he could not prevent a dragon from coming down from the [[Alley of Roses]], breaking through their lines. The dragon was accompanied by orcs and balrogs, among them [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]]. Even Tuor was thrown down, but Ecthelion sacrificed himself to kill Gothmog and buy the Gondothlim a little more time.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|183–4}} After King Turgon ordered the survivors to follow Tuor, they fled southward, and Glorfindel held the rear manfully, losing many more of his House in the process.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|186}}

After they had escaped Gondolin via [[Idril's secret way]], and passed through the [[Cristhorn]], Glorfindel again held the rear with the largest number of the unwounded. It was at that time that a Balrog and a contingent of Orcs ambushed their company.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|192–3}} There Glorfindel saved the lives of the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] when he defied the Balrog:
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel and the Balrog Above Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel and the Balrog above Gondolin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

{{blockquote|Then Glorfindel leapt forward upon him and his golden armour gleamed strangely in the moon, and he hewed at that demon that it leapt again upon a great boulder and Glorfindel after. Now there was a deadly combat upon that high rock above the folk; and these, pressed behind and hindered ahead, were grown so close that well nigh all could see, yet was it over ere Glorfindel's men could leap to his side. The ardour of Glorfindel drave that Balrog from point to point, and his mail fended him from its whip and claw. Now had he beaten a heavy swinge upon its iron helm, now hewn off the creature's whip-arm at the elbow. Then sprang the Balrog in the torment of his pain and fear full at Glorfindel, who stabbed like a dart of a snake; but he found only a shoulder, and was grappled, and they swayed to a fall upon the crag-top. Then Glorfindel's left hand sought a dirk, and this he thrust up that it pierced the Balrog's belly nigh his own face (for that demon was double his stature); and it shrieked, and fell backwards from the rock, and falling clutched Glorfindel's yellow locks beneath his cap, and those twain fell into the abyss.}}

The [[Noldoli]] still mourned the death of Glorfindel, and every time the [[Eldar]] saw a powerful fight between good and evil, they still said: ""''Alas! 'Tis Glorfindel and the Balrog''"". After the body of Glorfindel was recovered by Thorndor, Tuor allowed the folk of the Golden Flower to rise a cairn for him, there near the dangerous [[Thorn Sir]]. Despite being a unkindly place, yellow flowers grew upon the mound, and the place was always protected by Thorndor.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|194}}

====''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''====
In a hasty note about the Council of Elrond, Tolkien suggested that Glorfindel could tell of his ancestry in Gondolin, but this idea was never developed.<ref name=""Ancestry"">{{RS|1XI}}, p. 214</ref>

Glorfindel was originally planned to be part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], in a way taking the place of [[Legolas]].<ref>{{RS|4XXIII}}, pp. 397-8, 406</ref>

===Later legendarium===
====''[[The War of the Jewels]]''====
While composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered Glorfindel, [[Ecthelion]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel when she left the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]] in her way to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name=""Maeglin"" />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] didn't mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which his father discussed about the motives of Celegorm and Curufin of not sending any message to Gondolin about Aredhel. Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name=""Maeglin"">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|328}}

====''[[Last Writings]]''====
Tolkien first suggested that Glorfindel returned to Middle-earth about {{TA|1000}}, with [[Gandalf]].<ref name=""PoME-LW"" />{{rp|377}} But he later realized that Glorfindel only could come ''before'' the end of the Second Age and the [[Drowning of Númenor]], as with the [[Changing of the World]] Aman was removed from the [[Circles of the World]] and no living embodied creature could return from there. This was directly decreed by [[Ilúvatar]] to favour the [[Dominion of Men]]. It seems improbable that Manwë would have obtained special permission and devised a way of transportation, as that would seem to give Glorfindel an excessive importance.<ref name=""PoME-LW"" />{{rp|381–2}}

As told above, Glorfindel might have come as early as {{SA|1200}} and the years following, or as late as {{SA|1600}}. Although Tolkien declared the first to be possible, he favoured the last as the most probable.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
Glorfindel is rarely portrayed like in the book. In adaptations, there is usually not enough time to properly introduce a character that has little to do with the main plot. In the more popular works, his role has been filled by another Elf.

'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:This short Swedish adaptation of the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring is unusual among film adaptations in that shows Glorfindel fight the Nazgûl rather than have another character absorb his role.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:In this adaptation, the role of Glorfindel was taken by [[Legolas]]. In a simplification of that character, and as a reason for ''his'' coming, he is portrayed as an Elf of Rivendell rather than [[Mirkwood]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears in his original role at the Last Bridge, voiced by [[John Webb]]. Because the part of [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] was cut, the heavily wounded Frodo says the [[Quenya]] greeting ''[[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo]]'' to him, and Glorfindel replies with Gildor's answer. Glorfindel keeps his two [[Sindarin]] lines, ''[[A na vedui, Dúnadan!]]'' and ''[[Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!]]'', though he says them with a heavy English accent. Glorfindel's role at the Council of Elrond is omitted.  His name is pronounced correctly in the adaptation, but in the credits, his name is pronounced ""Glorfindle"".

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is a powerful playable character once [[the One Ring|the Ring]] passes the [[Last Bridge]], who leads the Fellowship to [[Rivendell]].

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Glorfindel is played by Stefan Schwartz.

'''1995: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:Glorfindel appears in ''The Wizards'' expansion. He is named Glorfindel II, though is still intended to be the Glorfindel from The Fellowship of the Ring. The most likely explanation for this would be that the creator of the card was unaware that The Silmarillion's Glorfindel was the same character as the one that appears in Fellowship.

'''1996: ''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: An Adventure Play''''': 
:In this children's theater script by Edward Mast, the show opens with [[Bilbo Baggins]] putting on a shadow play for the audience of Glorfindel's battle with the Balrog at the Fall of Gondolin to establish his love of telling adventurous tales. The allure of having his own story just as adventurous, though hopefully with a less tragic end, plays a role in convincing Bilbo to join [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:To limit the already large number of one-appearance characters, Glorfindel has been omitted in this adaptation as well. [[Peter Jackson]] decided to have [[Arwen]] meet the travellers and then ride on [[Asfaloth]].

'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Glorfindel is provided by Marián Zednikovič.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears on the Last Bridge. He has several Sindarin lines: ''A na vedui, Dúnadan'', like in the book, and ''Mae govannen, mellon'' (which Frodo accurately translates as ""Well met, friend""). He comes to the aid of the hobbits at the request of Elrond, who had received news from [[Gildor|a group of Elves travelling near the Shire]] - even though there is no mention of that group earlier in the gameplay. Glorfindel does so in a monotonous voice, and his speech continues without pause. He also uses the lines ''Noro lim, Asfaloth'', though he does not say them to his horse: he says them to Frodo. No actor is specified for this part.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the [[War of the Ring]]. Together with [[Glóin]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], Glorfindel fights in several places in northern [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]]. He is voiced by [[Jason Carter]], and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of [[Arvedui]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is featured in an extended flashback sequence depicting the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. During this time, he is the leader of the Bright Company, a group of [[High Elves]] who fighting to rid [[Middle-earth]] of [[Sauron]]'s evil long before that war and who continue their duty long after.
:In the present day, Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]]. He is involved in the campaign against [[Angmar]] during the main story and also talks to the player after defeating the [[balrog]] Thaurlach. Glorfindel disappears in the final weeks of the [[War of the Ring]] and the player tracks him across Middle-Earth to summon him to the Council of Elf-Lords between [[Thranduil]], [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. He joins the procession that escorts Lady [[Arwen]] to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding; along the way Glorfindel and [[Elrond]] assist [[Gandalf]] and the player in uncovering a mystery within the [[Gladden Fields]].

'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game). Glorfindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.

{{Quote|Once I was Gwindor son of Guilin, a lord of Nargothrond, until I went to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and was enslaved in Angband.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of Túrin Turambar]]""}}

'''Gwindor''' was a prince of the [[Elves of Nargothrond]]. He was most notable for his actions at the start of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] and his later relationship with [[Túrin]].

== History ==
Gwindor was born in [[Nargothrond]]<ref name=NRG/> to [[Guilin]], and was the brother of [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]. He was reckoned as a bold leader, and the scout who scoured most far afield of the folk of Nargothrond.<ref>{{LB|1d}}</ref> He was betrothed to [[Finduilas]] the daughter of [[Orodreth]]. 

=== Battle of Unnumbered Tears and thralldom===
His brother was lost during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and wishing to avenge this loss, he joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] and followed [[Fingon]] to battle.

During the assault, Gwindor led a small company of Elves of Nargothrond stationed at [[Barad Eithel]]. But the hosts of [[Morgoth]] were prepared; they brought his brother, still alive, then mutilated and slew him in front of the company. At the sight of Gelmir's mangled corpse, he charged on the plains of [[Anfauglith]], and thus beginning the battle of [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. It is said that Morgoth trembled as his company pounded on his gates, but he had ambushed the company within Angband itself, and all but Gwindor were slain.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

He spent fourteen years as a captive slave in Angband where the strength and beauty of his body were ruined. At some point, he received a small sword from another Elf who worked in the forges and, while working in a [[Thrall-Noldoli|stone-gang]], turned suddenly on the guards. Though he lost a hand in that fight, he managed to escape and fled southwards, eventually reaching [[Taur-nu-Fuin]].<ref>{{CH|9}}</ref>

[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Beleg is Slain.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Beleg is Slain'']]
As Gwindor lay exhausted, he was found by [[Beleg]] who was looking for his friend [[Túrin]]. Gwindor helped Beleg locate the [[Orc]]-band that had captured Túrin, and they freed him. But Túrin thought Beleg was an Orc and killed him before realizing his mistake. Gwindor consoled Túrin in his grief and led him to Nargothrond.

=== Return to Nargothrond ===
Túrin was admitted in the Elven realm thanks to Gwindor, but now Gwindor was worn out and did not have the power he once had before his capture. ""Agarwaen"" (Túrin's name while he stayed there) gained much influence among the Elves of Nargothrond and even Finduilas fell in love with him, a fact that Gwindor accepted without bitterness for Túrin. Believing that Finduilas would save Túrin from his fate, Gwindor revealed Agarwaen's identity to Finduilas, while he tried to persuade Túrin to return her feelings.

But when Túrin talked about open warfare upon Morgoth's forces, Gwindor could see the incoming doom of Nargothrond approach and counselled against this, only to be ignored. Orodreth the [[King of Nargothrond]] built a bridge, which not only eliminated the defence provided by the river [[Narog]], but also revealed the location of the Kingdom.

Indeed, Gwindor was right and [[Glaurung]] with a band of Orcs came. The Elves were driven towards the plain of [[Tumhalad]], where most of them, including King Orodreth and Gwindor, were slain in [[Battle of Tumhalad|battle]]. Before dying, he assigned the protection of Finduilas to Túrin, and that she alone could save him from the Curse of Morgoth; however his [[foresight]] did not come to be, as Túrin failed to protect her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Gwindor.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name is not explained, however in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the name-element ''-dor'' (a compounded form of [[Noldorin]] ''[[taur]]'') has the sense of ""king, master"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""TA"", ""TA3""</ref>

It has been suggested that the first element of the name could be ''gwind'' ""pale blue"".<ref>{{webcite|website=EoA|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/gwindor.html|articlename=Gwindor}}, citing {{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""WIN""</ref>
<!-- Another possibility from The Etymologies could be gwing ""spindrift"" -->

It has been suggested by Paul Strack and David Salo that the ''Gwindor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name could be derived from a combination of the elements ''[[gwain]]'' (""new"") + ''[[-dor]]'' (""lord"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3281252999.html|articlename=S.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Book of Lost Tales ===
In ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', he is initially named '''''Flinding''''', son of ''Duilin'', and serves the same role as an escaped thrall of Melko who assists in rescuing Túrin and eventually guiding him to the caves of the Rodothlim.<ref name=foaloke>{{LT2|II}}</ref> 

There is no relation stated between him and ''Failivrin'', daughter of [[Galweg]], who would become Finduilas.<ref name=foaloke/>

Flinding was only lightly injured during the pitched battle with the Orcs (what would become the Battle of Tumhalad), and aided Túrin in carrying the mortally wounded Orodreth back to the caves. He then stood beside Túrin in protecting the dwelling of Galweg from the ransacking Orcs until he was felled by an arrow to the eye.<ref name=foaloke/>

=== Lays of Beleriand ===
In ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', after escaping from the mines of Melkor, Flinding first crossed the [[Plains of Drouth]] before entering Taur-nu-Fuin. There his feet were entangled and he became enmeshed in its mazes, and he was taken by madness and wandered witless until he was heard by Orcs and pursued. The Orcs eventually found him, ""grovelled fainting"" and ""cowering"" and took him back to their camp. There he saw their spoils, countless chained captives (including Elfin maids), and Túrin held in baleful bonds. While in a bleeding swoon, the Orcs threw Flinding on the ""dung and slough"" of their lair, but he then escaped ""as a crawling worm on belly cowering"". 

Beleg insisted that Flinding show him the way to the Orc camp, which Flinding initially declined, stating that fear fettered him, and he would prefer to die in the dark, dazed and forwandered, than return to that anguish; he even claimed that he did not know the way. Beleg then admonished Flinding, reminding him of the might, mirth and renown of the Gnomes of Nargothrond.

{{quote|But fairer than all the wonders of Gondolin was Idril, Turgon's daughter, she that was called Celebrindal, the Silver-foot, whose hair was as the gold of Laurelin before the coming of Melkor.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Noldor in Beleriand]]""}}

'''Idril Celebrindal''' was the daughter of King [[Turgon]] of [[Gondolin]], the wife of [[Tuor]] and the mother of [[Eärendil|Eärendil the Mariner]].

Of the [[Noldor]] who [[Flight of the Noldor|returned]] to [[Middle-earth]] documented to have [[Vanyar]]in ancestry, Idril has the most, being five-eighths Vanyarin by ancestry. Her Vanyarin mother [[Elenwë]] died during the crossing at [[Helcaraxë]], and so did not set foot in Middle-earth.

==History==
Idril Celebrindal was the only child of Turgon. She participated in the [[Flight of the Noldor]], and had to cross the [[Helcaraxë]] with the host of Fingolfin. She and her mother Elenwë fell into the bitter waters, and Turgon risked his life to save them. But he only could save Idril, and her mother was covered in fallen ice.<ref>{{PM|XI4}}, pp. 343-344</ref>
[[File:Marya Filatova - Grinding Ice.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Grinding Ice'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
Together with [[Orodreth]] and [[Celebrimbor]], she was one of the three Noldor in the third generation to come into exile. She lived in [[Vinyamar]] in the first years after the Flight, but later she moved with her people to the Hidden City of [[Gondolin]] between {{FA|64}} and {{FA|116|n}}.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, §§88, 113</ref> In the city, the smithcraft [[Enerdhil]] made the famous gem [[Elfstone|Elessar]], and he gave it to Idril, who wore it upon her breast.<ref name=""Elessar"">{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 249</ref>

[[Maeglin]], the son of [[Aredhel]], Turgon's sister, became interested on Idril even before coming to the city, and when he saw her for the first time ""she seemed to him as the sun from which all the King's hall drew its light."" She was the only one who could pierce into his mind, and knowing his thought of her she loved him the less, as they were too closely related.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

When Tuor son of [[Huor]] was received in Gondolin, Idril sat on the left of her father. And while living there, the heart of Idril was turned to Tuor, and his to her. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), and remembering the last words of Huor, he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]], after [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]].<ref name=""Tuor"">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> From them [[Eärendil]] [[Half-elven]] was born, and she gave him the [[mother-name]] ''[[Ardamírë]]'', that foretold his destiny.<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 348</ref>

Years later, Morgoth had increased his efforts to find the city, ""but Idril Celebrindal was wise and farseeing, and her heart misgave her, and foreboding crept upon her spirit as a cloud."" Therefore, Idril let prepare a [[Idril's secret way|secret way]], and she contrived that this work was not known to Maeglin. Thus, when the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, she and Tuor were able to lead many [[Exiles of Gondolin|survivors]] out of the city and save their lives.<ref name=""Tuor"" />

After the fall of Gondolin, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the [[Havens of Sirion]], where they also received [[Elwing]], daughter of [[Dior]], son of Beren and Lúthien.

When Tuor grew old, he departed in his ship [[Eärrámë]] for the [[Aman|West]], and Idril went with him. Before leaving, she gave the [[Elfstone|Elessar]] to her son, saying: ""''The Elessar I leave with thee, for there are grievous hurts to Middle-earth which thou maybe shalt heal.''""<ref name=""Elessar"" /> It is believed by the Elves and [[Dúnedain]] that Idril and Tuor arrived in Valinor, and it is said that Tuor became reckoned in the kindred of the Elves, so that they both live in [[Valinor]].<ref name=""Tuor"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Idril Celebrindal.mp3|Ardamir}}
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Idril'' is not glossed, but the form of her [[Quenya]] name '''''Itarillë''''' (or ''Itarildë'') means ""Sparkling Brilliance"".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[ril]]''</ref>

She was called '''''Celebrindal''''' (""Silver-foot""), because she always went barefoot,<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> from ''[[celeb]]'' (""silver"") + ''[[tâl]]'' (""foot"").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[celeb]]'', ''[[tâl]]''</ref> Its Quenya equivalent with the same meaning was '''''Tyeleptalëa'''''.<ref>{{NM|Galadriel}}, p. 349</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', ''Idril'' meant ""Beloved"" in [[Gnomish]], but Elves often called her ''Idhril'', or in [[Qenya]] ''Irildë'', which meant ""mortal maiden"", because she married Tuor.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry ""Idril""</ref> Her after name ""Silver Feet"" was ''Tal-Celeb'' in Gnomish, and ''Taltelepta'' in Qenya.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 216</ref>

Idril's fate was woven with Tuor's since she first saw him from a high window the day he came to the city. Tuor also loved her in secret for many years until his heart was full, and Turgon did not oppose to their union. This was the first [[Unions of Elves and Men|marriage between a Man and an Elf]], and it was made in [[Gar Ainion]] to the great joy of the [[Gondothlim]], except [[Meglin]].<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|164}}

Idril had great skill to see the hearts of Elves and Men, and a special power to [[Foresight|foresee the future]]. Thus, one year after the birth of [[Eärendel]], she told Tuor of a dream she had: Meglin threw their son into a furnace and he wanted to thrust them in too. Therefore, she asked Tuor to begin the building of a [[Idril's secret way|secret way]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|167–8}} Seven years later, Idril became taciturn, and prophesied to Tuor that he would have to make a choice, and that the time was near. Her husband could not understand her, but obeyed her counsels.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|170–1}}
[[File:Marya Filatova - Action-girl-Idril.jpg|thumb|right|''Action-girl Idril'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, she arrayed herself in mail, and gave Eärendel a tiny mail coat she had ordered in secret.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|174}} But her house was attacked by the [[folk of the Mole]], and Meglin tried to throw Eärendel from the walls while dragging her by the hair to make her see it. But Eärendel resisted and ""she fought, alone as she was, like a tigress for all her beauty and slenderness"". Then came Tuor and his [[folk of the Wing]], saving them. Her husband left her there with [[Voronwë]] and other men, and went to battle.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|177–8}}

During the siege of the city, Idril was in the door of her house and sent most of her guard down the secret tunnel with Eärendel. But she refused to leave without her lord. Meanwhile, she gathered women and wanderers, showing them the secret tunnel; and her men helped her fighting marauders, but they might not dissuade her from bearing a sword. However, a band of enemies took over the house, and Idril became distraught by grief and fatigue, and running away from the house she arrived to Gar Ainion. There Tuor found her like in the day of their wedding, but she could not recognize him: she was out of her mind, watching the fall of her father. Then Tuor took her and went down the secret tunnel. When the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] reached [[Tumladin]], she spoke against those who wanted to march to the [[Way of Escape]], explaining it was no longer protected, ""''for what magic stands if Gondolin be fallen?''""<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|186–9}} After the survivors were saved by the [[Eagles]], Idril and her people wore an eagle as emblem.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|193}}

Tolkien did not finish ''The Book of Lost Tales'', so the end of Idril and Tuor is very different in each outline of their story. Like in the published ''Silmarillion'', in all versions Tuor sails west after falling into age. In the most repeated version, Tuor sails without Idril, who grieves him with Eärendel; later she vanishes (sailing at night).<ref name=""Earendel"">{{LT2|V}}</ref>{{rp|253–4}} In another version, Idril swam after her husband.<ref name=""Earendel"" />{{rp|260}} In a separate note, Tolkien considered her death,<ref name=""Earendel"" />{{rp|263}} but this contradicts the last one he chose, in which ""Tuor and Idril some say sail now in [[Eärrámë|Swanwing]] and may be seen going swift down the wind at down and dusk"".<ref name=""Earendel"" />{{rp|255}}

'''Pengolodh''' was a [[Loremaster]] of the [[Noldor]] in [[Gondolin]].

==History==
Pengolodh was an [[Elves|Elf]], born in [[Nevrast]] to a [[Sindar]]in and a [[Noldor]]in parent; when [[Turgon]] built his Hidden City in [[Tumladen]], he moved with his people there. As a member of the [[Lambengolmor]], he was known as the ""Sage of the Noldor"", and counted as the greatest Loremaster since [[Fëanor]] and [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]].<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 396-7</ref>

Pengolodh escaped the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], and followed them to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=Quendi/> The ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'' are attributed to him, as well as the edited ''[[Annals of Valinor]]'' (furthering the work of Rúmil).

It was during his stay at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees of [[Doriath]], he made copies and extracts of documents written in [[Cirth]],<ref name=Quendi/> possibly preserving them as an active writing system; possibly he must have stayed in [[Lindon]] for at least a while after the [[War of Wrath]], so that the [[Dúnedain]] could copy his work.

Later, in the [[Second Age]], he dwelt in the Kingdom of [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]],<ref name=Quendi/> where he might have learned [[Khuzdul]].<ref group=note>The essay ""[[Quendi and Eldar]]"" never explicitly mentions that Pengolodh was taught Khuzdul, but in a different account of his life it is stated that he learned Khuzdul ""''in its archaic form as used in the habitations of the Dwarves in [[Blue Mountains|Ered Lindon]]''"" ({{VT|48a}}, p. 6 (Note 3)).</ref> 

Unlike the early [[loremasters]] who did not give much importance to ''[[hwermë]]'', it is said that Pengolodh collected much material concerning gesture-systems.<ref>{{WJ|AD}}, pp. 395, 397</ref> 

It was during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] and after the fall of [[Eregion]] when Pengolodh left [[Middle-earth]] for [[Tol Eressëa]], last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.<ref name=Quendi/>

Ages later, he accepted [[Ælfwine]] the traveler and taught him about the Elves and the [[Elder Days]]. Some of their discussions were recorded as ''[[Dangweth Pengoloð]]''.

==Works==
There are many Elvish texts of unknown author that could be attributed to Pengolodh, but here are listed only those explicitly written by him. It is also unknown how many of his works were included in the [[Translations from the Elvish]].

*''[[Annals of Beleriand]]''
*''[[Dangweth Pengoloð]]''
**''[[Of Lembas]]''
*''[[Eldarinwë Leperi arë Notessi]]''
*''[[Ósanwe-kenta]]'' (only survives summarized)
*''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''

First written by Rúmil:
*''[[Annals of Valinor]]''
*''[[Lhammas]]''
*''[[Ainulindalë]]'' (narrated to Ælfwine by Pengolodh)

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Pengolodh'' is glossed as ""'teaching sage', doctor of lore"",<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 139</ref> consisting of the words ''[[pen]]'' (""somebody"") and ''[[golodh]]'' (""lore-master, sage"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-8990395.html|articlename=S. ''Pengolodh'' n.|website=[http://eldamo.org/index.html Eldamo - An Elvish Lexicon]|accessed=23 December 2019}}</ref> The [[Quenya]] version of his name was '''''Quendingoldo''''' or '''''Quengoldo'''''.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, pp. 401, 404-5</ref><ref>{{VT|48a}}, pp. 5, 14</ref>

''Pengolodh'' also appears spelled '''''Pengolod''''', '''''Pengoloð''''',<ref name=PE17/> '''''Pengoloth''''', and '''''Pengoloþ'''''.

In some of his [[Quendi and Eldar|later writings]] (c. 1959/1960), Tolkien proposed changing the character's name to '''''Thingódhel'''''.<ref>{{WJ|Editor}}, note 25, p. 419</ref> The name is Sindarin for ""Grey Noldo"", from ''[[thind]]'' (""grey"") + ''[[Gódhel]]'' (""[Exiled] Noldo"").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3637508661.html|articlename=S. ''Thingódhel'' pn.|website=Eldamo|accessed=16 February 2025}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Pengolodh does not appear in any of the canon narratives of Middle-earth, but is mentioned in texts published in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''; he is given as the fictional author of many works, including the ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'', a work which was developed by Tolkien at the same time as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and from which [[Christopher Tolkien]] drew much information to establish the published ''Silmarillion''. Various late essays by Tolkien dealing with linguistics are presented as being the work of Pengolodh, including the remarkable work ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''.

Because of Pengolodh's nature as a literary device, he does not appear actively as a protagonist in any of the stories. All information about his life come from biographical notes written by Tolkien.

Early Tolkien texts stated that, after removing to Tol Eressëa, Pengolodh lived in a village called ''[[Tavrobel]]'' (or ''Tathrobel''). Centuries later [[Ælfwine]] spoke with him there. The figure of [[Gilfanon]], which fulfilled a similar role as a chronicler of the annals of Beleriand in earlier works, probably became this character as well in Tolkien's mind.<ref>{{LR|Appendix}}</ref>

===Possible erasure from the legendarium===
In the late 1950s Tolkien apparently decided that the [[legendarium]] is not Elvish, but a Mannish tradition.<ref>{{MR|P5I}}</ref> Dawn M. Walls-Thumma notes that after that point, Pengolodh's name fails to be mentioned by Tolkien in the later works and revisions; for example the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' are attributed to Sindarin and Noldorin sources but Pengolodh is not mentioned; Pengolodh was mentioned in the first draft of ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', along with [[Quennar]] and Rúmil, but in the second draft only Rúmil remains; Pengolodh's name is also removed in a revision of ''[[The Tale of Years (The War of the Jewels)|The Tale of Years]]'' and while Pengolodh was attributed in the First Phase of [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|The Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']], his name is removed from the Second Phase. Walls-Thumma however notes that the texts are still Elf-focused and they still include elements that wouldn't be known by Rúmil alone.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Dawn M. Walls-Thumma]]|articleurl=http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/references/pf/pengolodh.php|articlename=Character Biography: Pengolodh|website=Silmarillion Writers' Guild|accessed=8 July 2023}}</ref>

'''Írimë''' was a [[Noldor]]in [[Elves|Elf]]. She was the third child (and second daughter) of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]], and [[Indis]], his second wife. She was the sister of [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], and [[Finarfin]], as well as the half-sister of [[Fëanor]].<ref name=""Shib"">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 343</ref>
 
==History==
Little is known about Írimë, except that during the [[Exile of the Noldor]] she went to [[Middle-earth]] across the [[Helcaraxë]] with her elder brother, Fingolfin, whom she was close to, while the rest of her siblings remained in [[Valinor]].<ref name=""Shib""/> Írimë's fate is unknown; she may have been slain or returned to [[Aman]] after the [[War of Wrath]].

==Etymology==
''Írimë'' is clearly [[Quenya]], probably a feminized form of ''[[írima]]'' (""desirable, lovely"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1943306515.html|articlename=Q. ''Írimë'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=3 August 2022}}</ref>

==Other names==
Her [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''Lalwendë''''', or in shortened form '''''Lalwen''''', and she was generally known by this name. This short name was not changed in Middle-earth, as it fit [[Sindarin]].<ref name=""Shib""/> The Sindarin version of this name would have been '''''Glaðwen'''''.<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 359, note 29</ref>

In the same lines of ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', [[Tolkien]] contradictorily gave both ''Írimë'' and '''''Írien''''' as names for this character. His son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] explains his father could have been influenced by the previous genealogies.<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 359, note 28</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The first introduction of Írimë in the [[legendarium]] was during the composition of [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|the Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']], in which Finwë also had another daughter called [[Faniel]].<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 207</ref> In a following revision, her name was changed to ''Finvain'',<ref>{{MR|P3I6}}, p. 262, footnote.

'''Bard II''' was the son of [[Brand]] and heir to the [[Kingdom of Dale]].

==History==
During the [[War of the Ring]] his father was slain in the [[Battle of Dale]], and Bard with many [[Men of Dale]] and [[Dwarves of Erebor]] were forced back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Easterlings]]. There he was besieged with his ally [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]] for several days. 

When news came from the south of the destruction of [[Sauron]], Bard and Thorin emerged from the Lonely Mountain and broke the siege.  Later he sent an ambassador to the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and thereafter his kingdom enjoyed the protection of the [[King of the West]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

'''Fram''' was the son of [[Frumgar]]<ref name=""Eorl"">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> and [[Lord of the Éothéod]]. It is possible that he was the fifth Lord of the Éothéod and the great-grandson of [[Forthwini]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Michael Martinez|articleurl=https://middle-earth.xenite.org/how-many-lords-of-eotheod-were-there/|articlename=How Many Lords of Éothéod Were There?|dated=10 October 2013|website=middle-earth.xenite.org|accessed=20 February 2022}}</ref>

== History ==
During his rule the [[Éothéod]] lived in the land between the [[Misty Mountains]] on the west, the [[Forest River]] in the east, the confluence of the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]] in the south<ref>{{UT|Ride}}, second paragraph</ref> and the [[Grey Mountains]] in the north and were troubled by the [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] [[Scatha]]. Fram slew the Dragon, took an [[Horn of the Mark|ancient horn]],<ref name=collectedpoemsnote>{{CP|177}}, manuscript note</ref> and claimed his<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|177}}, third version</ref> hoard as his own. The [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|Dwarves of that region]] also laid claim to the treasure, but Fram rebuked the claim, instead sending them the teeth of the Dragon along with a message. The message angered the Dwarves, and it was rumoured that they killed Fram for it.<ref name=""Eorl""/>

:Fram appear in a series of flashbacks narrating the history of [[Éothéod]]. When [[Scatha]] attacked [[Framsburg]], [[Frumgar]] lost the use of his sword-arm, after which Fram swore revenge and hunted Scatha alone for two years. Frumgar died shortly after Fram returned with Scatha's treasure, while Fram himself was not killed by Dwarves, but by the servants of the Enemy who made it look like Dwarves were involved to sow dissent in the North. Fram left three sons, Gifica, Gundamári and Gisilhári. None of them were at age at the time of Fram's death and the two eldest died in battles against Orcs.

'''Girion''' (d. {{TA|2770}}<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref>) was the last Lord of [[Dale]]. 

==History==
Girion was a [[Men of Dale|Man of Dale]] and became lord of the city. Not much can be said about his life and rule, other than he had a wife, and at least two sons.<ref name=""Fire"">{{H|14}}</ref>

He possessed a [[Necklace of Girion|Necklace]] made of five hundred emeralds. When the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] forged a coat of dwarf-linked rings, presumably of [[mithril]], for his eldest son, Girion gave the necklace to the Dwarves as a payment.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>  

He witnessed the arrival of [[Smaug]] when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] assaulted Dale and the neighbouring [[Dwarves|dwarf]] realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Girion was killed during that event but his wife and child escaped down the [[River Running]].<ref name=""Fire"">{{H|14}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Many years later, his descendant [[Bard]] was still living in [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]]. He took revenge upon the dragon by slaying him with [[Black Arrow|an arrow]].<ref name=""Fire""/> His necklace was found among the dragon's hoard.

==Etymology==
Although the names of Dale are [[Norse]], ''Girion'' seems to be a [[Sindarin]] name. The meaning is not clear but the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' give a [[Noldorin]] [[Sundocarme|root]] GIR (""quiver, shudder""),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 358</ref> which might be related.

:Grimbeorn is the lord of all Beornings and lives at his home, the [[Beorn's Hall|Beorninghús]], with his wife Gírta and three children: the eldest daughter Langhár, the middle son Sterkist and the youngest, who becomes the [[Beorning]] player's character after Grimbeorn sends them to find the Ranger [[Aragorn]] at the urging of [[Radagast]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] Grimbeorn visits the camp of Vindurhal in the [[High Pass]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], but returns home soon after. After the destruction of [[The One Ring]], Grimbeorn is visited by [[Gandalf]], [[Legolas]] and the player on their journey back to [[Gondor]] after a brief visit to the northern lands. Already annoyed by a number of visitors, Grimbeorn is then forced to host a much larger procession when [[Elrond]] and much of his house stay at his lodge on their way to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Arwen]]'s wedding.

'''Herendil''' was the son of [[Elendil]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.

== History ==
Herendil was a daring diver and he was prideful of his talent. In the aftermath of one such dive, his father, [[Elendil]], observes that he seems to have grown drastically and tells Herendil that he has the makings of a fine man.<ref name=P1/>

To this, Herendil rebukes his father, believing the comment to be one of mockery, claiming that Elendil knew already that he was of a lesser height than others of his age, and that he was tormented by that. Herendil stated in evidence that he was barely of height to [[Almáriel]]'s shoulder.<ref name=P1/>

Herendil then informed his father that though the two of them are the blood of kings, his peers called him names such as ""Terendul"" the day prior, and accused him of being a ""half-Noldo."" Herendil admitted, however, that it is at least better than ""being called half a Gnome"".<ref name=P1/>

Elendil responded saying that then it may be dangerous for Herendil to be his son as his own father's name, [[Valandil (The Lost Road)|Valandil]], meant ''""God-friend""''.<ref name=P1>{{LR|P1III2}}, pp. 59-61</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Herendil'' is [[Quenya]], being a compound of ''heren'' (""fortune, governance"") + ''(-n)dil'' (""friend""). Its [[Old English]] cognate was ''[[Eadwine]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""KHER-"", ""NIL-, NDIL-""</ref> which means ""Fortune-friend"".<ref>{{LR|P1III1}}, Chapter II: ''Alboin and Audoin'', p. 46</ref>

The derisive name, ''Terendul'', meaning ""slender and dark"",<ref name=P1/> contains the elements ''teren'' (""slender"") + ''nulla'' (""dark, dusky, obscure"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""TER-, TERES-"", ""NDUL-""</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an earlier draft of ''[[The Lost Road]]'', Herendil was called ''[[Eärendil|Eärendel]]'' in scorn or mockery by a [[Men|man]] named [[Poldor]] rather than being called ''Terendul'' by anonymous peers.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 70, note 5</ref>

Tolkien eventually abandoned his work ''[[The Lost Road]]'', yet many elements of Herendil were merged into the character of '''[[Isildur]]''' within ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{Fact}}

<blockquote>''""Ar-Pharazôn the Golden was the proudest and most powerful of all the Kings, and no less than the kingship of the world was his desire.""'' —''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]]</blockquote>

'''Ar-'''Pharazôn''' the Golden''' was the twenty-fifth and last [[King of Númenor|King]] of [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}</ref> He was the son of [[Gimilkhâd]], who was the younger brother of the twenty-fourth King, [[Tar-Palantir]]. Ar-Pharazôn's willful rule, and his great pride, led directly to the [[Bent World|world-changing]] [[Downfall of Númenor]] and the founding of the [[realms in exile]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]].<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

== History ==
In his youth, Pharazôn and [[Amandil]], the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] and later the leader of the [[Faithful]] Númenóreans, were dear friends. After some time, Pharazôn departed from Númenor to participate in the wars in [[Middle-earth]] that the [[King's Men]] were waging against [[Sauron]]. While in Middle-earth, he became a great captain and commander of the Númenórean armies. Pharazôn did not return to Númenor until a few years before the death of Tar-Palantir, when he heard of his own father's early death. During his time there, Pharazôn was generous with the wealth he had acquired in Middle-earth, and the hearts of the people were turned toward him.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/> Like his father, Pharazôn became the leader of the rebellion against his uncle the King's reforms, who attempted to return to the ways of the [[Valar]] and the [[Eldar]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

=== King of Númenor ===
He remained on the island until Tar-Palantir died. At that time, Pharazôn took the King's daughter [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]] as his wife, much against her will, and against the laws of Númenor which prohibited first cousins from marrying. Pharazôn then changed her name to Ar-Zimraphel.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/> Thus he usurped the throne and, taking the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] into his own hand, proclaimed himself King Ar-Pharazôn in {{SA|3255}}.<ref name=""SA"">{{App|SA}}</ref>

Soon after Ar-Pharazôn's unlawful ascent to power, he heard news that Sauron had been assailing the Númenórean settlements in Middle-earth since his return to the island. His captains explained to him that the fallen [[Maia]] wished to drive the Númenóreans back to the [[Belegaer|Sea]] whence they had come, and declare himself King of Men. They also told Ar-Pharazôn that Sauron wished to destroy Númenor itself, if possible.

==== Ar-Pharazôn humbles Sauron ====
Ar-Pharazôn became very angry upon hearing this news, and decided that he himself would claim the title of King of Men instead, and make Sauron his servant. To accomplish this end, he spent five years preparing a great force.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/> In {{SA|3261|n}} he launched the Númenórean fleet and landed at the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]].<ref name=""SA""/> From there, Ar-Pharazôn and his army marched north to [[Mordor]]. Their splendour and might was so great that Sauron's own servants deserted him. Therefore, since he perceived that he could not defeat the Númenóreans through strength of arms, Sauron changed into his fair form and humbled himself before Ar-Pharazôn. The King stripped Sauron of his titles and decreed that he would be taken as a hostage to Númenor, to keep his servants from harassing the Númenóreans in Middle-earth. 

Sauron acted as if this decision dismayed him, but it actually furthered his plans to destroy Ar-Pharazôn and the Númenóreans in retaliation for this humiliation. Sauron thus allowed himself to be brought to Númenor by Ar-Pharazôn's army, but as soon as he set foot on the island he began corrupting the minds of the Númenóreans, beginning with their proud King. Sauron flattered Ar-Pharazôn and used his knowledge to help the King gain anything he desired. Ar-Pharazôn responded to this flattery and made Sauron his chief adviser three years after his coming to Númenor.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/>

==== Sauron's teachings ====
[[File:Janka Latečková - Sauron and Ar-Pharazon.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Sauron and Ar-Pharazôn'' by [[:Category:Images by Janka Latečková|Janka Latečková]]]]
Sauron taught the people of Númenor many things, and in most of his speeches he spoke against the [[Valar]], whom most Númenóreans already feared and disliked. Eventually, however, the Maia's teachings began to focus more upon [[Darkness (concept)|Darkness]]. He told his listeners that ""Darkness alone is worshipful, and the Lord thereof may yet make other worlds to be gifts to those that serve him, so that the increase of their power shall find no end."" These words reached the ears of Ar-Pharazôn, and he spoke to Sauron in secret in order to learn more about the Lord of Darkness. Sauron told the King that this Lord was [[Morgoth|Melkor]], and that [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]] was only a lie devised by the Valar to keep [[Men]] from rebelling against them. The Maia thus himself lied to Ar-Pharazôn, and said that by serving Melkor, the ""Giver of Freedom"", the King would escape from these untruths of the Valar, and become stronger than them.

At this time Ar-Pharazôn began to worship the Darkness and Melkor its Lord. He practised this new religion in secret at first, but soon displayed it openly, and most of his people followed him. The King made ascending the [[Meneltarma]] (which the worshippers of Ilúvatar had formerly done, in order to make offerings on its summit) a crime punishable by death. Sauron then advised Ar-Pharazôn to destroy [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], the White Tree of Númenor, which was the last symbol of the Númenóreans' ancient friendship with the Valar and the [[Elves]]. Ar-Pharazôn was reluctant to do this, because he had heard of Tar-Palantir's prophecy that the Line of Kings would end when the Tree perished.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/>

==== Years of tyranny ====
[[File:Joel Kilpatrick - Corrupting Counsel.jpg|thumb|''Corrupting Counsel'' by [[:Category:Images by Joel Kilpatrick|Joel Kilpatrick]]]]
However, when a disguised man (actually [[Isildur]]) stole a fruit from Nimloth upon hearing Sauron's advice to the King, Ar-Pharazôn assented to the Tree's destruction. It was also at this time that Ar-Pharazôn dismissed his erstwhile friend Amandil from his [[Council of the Sceptre|Council]], though the King and his supporters did not otherwise harm Amandil or his family. After the White Tree was felled, Sauron had it burned in a mighty [[Temple]] that the Númenóreans had built in [[Armenelos]] on his orders. The King and his followers then used this Temple for the worship of Melkor. They captured members of the Faithful and sacrificed them in the fires of the altar, in the hope that Melkor would release them from [[Gift of Men|Death]]. The Númenóreans did the same to the Men of Middle-earth who lived near their settlements, and thus Ar-Pharazôn became the greatest tyrant that the world had seen since [[Morgoth]], though Sauron actually ruled all from behind the throne.

But Ar-Pharazôn and the Númenóreans did not escape death by this means, and eventually the King grew old and was in great fear of the end of his life and going out into the Darkness that he had worshipped. Ar-Pharazôn became wrathful and desperate, and at last Sauron gave the King his final advice. The Maia told Ar-Pharazôn that by warring against the Valar and conquering [[Valinor]], their land in [[Aman|the West]], he could gain everlasting life.<ref name=""Akallabeth""/> Ar-Pharazôn feared to wage such a war, but his desperation prompted him to begin building a [[Great Armament]] in {{SA|3310|n}} to attack Valinor.<ref name=""SA""/>

While this Armament was being constructed, the Valar sent warnings to the Númenóreans in the form of terrible thunderstorms and clouds shaped like [[Eagles]], and the ground began to groan and shake. But these signals only caused the King and his people to harden their hearts yet more, and Ar-Pharazôn (prompted by Sauron) proclaimed, ""The [[Valar|Lords of the West]] have plotted against us. They strike first. The next blow shall be ours!""<ref name=""Akallabeth""/>

==== War against the Valar ====
[[File:John Howe - The Fleet of Ar-Pharazon.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[John Howe]] - ''Fleet of Ar-Pharazôn'']]
Nine years after the preparations for war began, the Great Armament was completed. Ar-Pharazôn journeyed to the west of Númenor where the fleet was anchored, and boarded his mighty ship [[Alcarondas]]. He sat upon his throne in full armour and signalled for the raising of the anchors. The fleet left Númenor just before sundown, and passed into the forbidden seas of the West.

Because no one from the Great Armament ever returned to mortal lands, Ar-Pharazôn's fate remains uncertain. It is said in the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' that the fleet passed [[Tol Eressëa]] and anchored near the coast of Valinor. Upon seeing the splendour of [[Taniquetil]], Ar-Pharazôn became afraid and nearly gave the order to retreat. In the end, however, his pride caused him to go ashore, and a great part of his army followed him. Ar-Pharazôn led his troops to the Elven city of [[Tirion]], and they set up an encampment around it. Then the King proclaimed that the land of the Valar was his, if none would challenge him for it.

At this time, the Valar called upon Eru for aid, and relinquished their authority over [[Arda]]. Eru broke the world and made it round, so that Men could never again sail to Valinor. In this catastrophe, Ar-Pharazôn's fleet was pulled into the chasm that opened between the [[Blessed Realm]] and mortal lands, and Númenor sank beneath the Sea. Ar-Pharazôn himself (along with the soldiers that had followed him to Valinor) is said to have been buried underground, and lies in the [[Caves of the Forgotten]] until the [[Final Battle|Last Battle]].<ref name=""Akallabeth""/>

== Legacy ==
Though Ar-Pharazôn was the last King of Númenor, the Line of [[Elros]] survived through [[Elendil]] the son of Amandil, and his two sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]. They managed to escape the [[Downfall of Númenor]] that Ar-Pharazôn's actions had caused, and later created the kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] in [[Middle-earth]].

Sometime before his death at the end of the [[Second Age]], Elendil wrote down some of the history of Númenor, culminating in the tale of its destruction. Much of this document was focused on the effects of the reign of Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron's teachings to the Númenóreans. Elendil's work was called the ''[[Akallabêth]]'', and its retelling of Ar-Pharazôn's life was one of the only parts of Númenor's history that remained widely known after the Downfall.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Note 16</ref>

Many years after the Downfall, the [[Kings of Gondor]] erected a great pillar at Umbar as a commemoration of Ar-Pharazôn. Even though Elendil's people suffered greatly because of the evil that Sauron caused in Númenor as a result of Ar-Pharazôn's deeds, his descendants still wished to honour the King and his army for the humbling of Sauron. When Sauron retook Umbar from the Gondorians, he in turn had this monument to his defeat destroyed.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Pharazôn'' means ""Golden"" in [[Adûnaic]], and is derived from the word ''[[pharaz]]'', 'gold'.<ref>{{App|Consonants}}</ref><ref>{{SD|Nouns}}, p. 426</ref>

== Other names ==
Had Ar-Pharazôn taken a [[Quenya]] name, he would have ruled as '''''Tar-Calion'''''.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry XXV ''Ar-Pharazôn (Tar-Calion)''</ref> This title does not appear to be a direct translation of his Adûnaic name, since it means ""Son of Light"" (from ''[[cala]]'' 'light', and ''[[-ion]]'', the masculine patronymic).<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2978386403.html|articlename=S. ''Calion'' m.|website=[http://eldamo.org/index.html Eldamo - An Elvish Lexicon]|accessed=2 May 2019}}</ref> Like all the other Kings of Númenor who took their royal names in Adûnaic, Pharazôn added the prefix ''[[ar]]'' ('high', 'King') to his name when he seized the Sceptre.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entries XX to XXIII and XXV</ref>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted the name '''''Tar-kulu''''' (in the entry for [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KUL]]), which editors [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] suggest could be a formerly unattested name of Ar-Pharazôn.<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 24</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In earlier versions of the ''Akallabêth'', Ar-Pharazôn summoned Sauron to Númenor instead of taking an army to Middle-earth and humbling him. The elements of Morgoth-worship and human sacrifice were not originally parts of his rule, either; in the first stories of the Downfall, Ar-Pharazôn merely built the Temple (on top of the Meneltarma, however) for future use and allowed Sauron to watch the people from it.

Alternate stories of Ar-Pharazôn's life written by Tolkien include a version in which Míriel was actually attracted to him, and their marriage was consensual. She gave him most of her power voluntarily. This remarkable textual development existed even in some of the latest revisions of the ''Akallabêth''.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>

In the earliest drafts of the ''Akallabêth'', Ar-Pharazôn was named '''Angor'''<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}, §5</ref> later replaced by '''Tar-kalion'''<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}, §5</ref> and then '''Tarkalion'''.<ref>{{SD|3ii}}, §20</ref>

Ciryatur had divided his forces and sent a great part of them directly to<ref name=Concerning/> [[Lindon]].<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1700, p. 1083</ref> When the fleet arrived in Lindon, Gil-galad’s [[Elves]] had been beaten back to the river [[Lhûn]] and were holding the line of the river together with a Númenórean force that had been stationed on the shores of Lindon earlier after Gil-Galad feared that Sauron would invade Eriador. Reinforced by the fresh forces from Númenor the Elves of Lindon and the Númenoreans defeated the forces of Sauron at the river Lhûn and drove them back to the south-east. The forces of Sauron were further decimated in a battle at the [[Sarn Ford]] at the river [[Baranduin]].<ref name=Concerning/>

Sauron was driven further to the south-east to [[Tharbad]] at the crossings of the river [[Gwathló]] where he was reinforced by more of his troops that had come at his orders from the south-east. But Ciryatur had sent a strong force to the small Númenórean harbour of [[Vinyalondë]]<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]]. This second Númenórean force appeared in the rear of Sauron's army at the Gwathló. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Gwathló]], the host of Sauron was completely routed and Sauron himself barely escaped. A final battle in eastern [[Calenardhon]] stripped Sauron of all but a tiny bodyguard. The Dark Lord retreated into [[Mordor]] and plotted vengeance upon the Númenóreans.<ref name=Concerning/>

==Etymology==
''Ciryatur'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that it means ""Ship Master"", being a compound of ''[[cirya]]'' (""ship"") + suffix ''[[tur]]'' (""master"")<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3211461155.html|articlename=Q. ''Ciryatur'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref> — an appropriate name for an admiral. It is in fact possible that this is the name of his position rather than his real name (cf. [[Ohtar]]).

'''Isildur''' was the eldest son and heir of [[Elendil]], the first [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] of the [[Realms in Exile]]. 

==History==
===Early Years in Númenor===
Isildur was born in Númenor in {{SA|3209}}. He was the elder son of [[Elendil]], son of [[Amandil]], the last [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. His younger brother was [[Anárion]]. While living in the island realm he married and his first son, [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]] was born in {{SA|3299|n}}.<ref name=""Elendil"">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

Isildur learned from Amandil that King [[Ar-Pharazôn]], under the influence of [[Sauron]], purposed to cut down [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]].  One night Isildur went in disguise to [[Armenelos]] and from the courts of the King stole a fruit from the tree before it was cut down, thus preserving the line of the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]].  It is said that he received grievous wounds from the King's guards before escaping but that they all healed when a leaf first appeared on the sapling that grew from the fruit he had taken.<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

When Ar-Pharazôn ordered the [[Great Armament]] to assail the land of [[Aman]], Elendil and his sons prepared ships to escape from Númenor.  In the ship of Isildur was guarded the young White Tree.<ref name=""Akallabeth"" />  When the [[Downfall of Númenor]] came in {{SA|3319|n}}<ref name=""SA"">{{App|SA}}</ref> Elendil and his sons escaped in nine ships – four for Elendil, three for Isildur, and two for Anárion.<ref name=""Akallabeth"" />

===Joint Reign of Gondor===
In the great storm that came with the drowning of Númenor the nine ships of the Exiles were borne to the east and scattered.  Elendil was cast up in the land of [[Lindon]], passed up the River [[Lhûn]], and founded the realm of [[Arnor]].  Isildur and Anárion were carried to the south.  Arriving at the mouths of the [[Anduin]], they ascended the great river and founded the realm of [[Gondor]].<ref name=""Rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref> While the Exiles were establishing their [[Realms in Exile]] in {{SA|3320}} however, Sauron had also escaped and re-established his power in [[Mordor]] .<ref name=""SA"" />

Isildur set up his house in [[Minas Ithil]], where he planted the White Tree, while Anárion established his household in [[Minas Anor]]. However, they jointly ruled the kingdom and set up thrones side by side in the Great Hall of [[Osgiliath]].<ref name=""Rings"" /> Isildur and his wife had two more sons, [[Aratan]] (in {{SA|3339|n}}) and [[Ciryon]] (in {{SA|3379|n}}), while living in Gondor.<ref name=""Elendil"" />

In {{SA|3429|n}} [[Sauron]] [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|captured Minas Ithil]] and burnt the White Tree. Yet Isildur escaped with his wife and sons, and a seedling of the White Tree. While Anárion held Osgiliath, Isildur and his family sailed down the Anduin, then northwest his father in [[Arnor]] and to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]].<ref name=""SA"" /><ref name=""Rings"" />

===The War of the Last Alliance===
[[File:Cor Blok - Isildur Takes the Ring.jpg|200px|thumb|left|""Isildur Takes [[The One Ring|the Ring]]"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
In {{SA|3430}}, the same year that Isildur's fourth son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] was born, Isildur's father Elendil and Gil-galad formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]].  The army of the Alliance marched to [[Rivendell|Imladris]] in {{SA|3431|n}}, where Isildur left his wife and Valandil before the host moved on.  In {{SA|3434|n}} the combined armies of Elves and Men crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] and marched on to the [[Dagorlad]].  There the forces of Sauron were defeated and he retreated into the [[Barad-dûr]] to withstand a siege.<ref name=""SA"" />

The siege lasted seven years, but finally Elendil and Gil-galad threw down Sauron, thus winning the battle though both were slain and Elendil's sword [[Narsil]] broke under him as he fell.  Isildur took the hilt shard of his father's sword and cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron's finger.  Ignoring the advice of [[Elrond]] and [[Círdan]], lieutenant of Gil-galad, Isildur did not destroy the Ring; instead he claimed it as a weregild for the deaths of his father and brother, and an heirloom for his House.<ref name=""Rings"" />

===Triumph and Disaster===
After the fall of Sauron, Isildur returned to Gondor and assumed the [[Elendilmir]], proclaiming his Kingship in Arnor and sovereign lordship over the [[Dúnedain]] in both the North and the South.<ref name=""Gladden"">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref><ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> He remained for a year in the South, planted the seedling of the White Tree in Minas Anor in memory of his brother [[Anárion]], put the realm to order, and instructed his nephew [[Meneldil]], son of Anárion, in the governance of the land.<ref name=""ta"">{{App|TA}}</ref>  With Meneldil and a company of trusted friends, Isildur rode about the boundaries of Gondor and in [[Anórien]] created the [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb]] and memorial of Elendil upon the hill of [[Eilenaer]], thereafter called [[Amon Anwar]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> While he remained there, he wrote an [[Scroll of Isildur|account]] on how he acquired the Ring, its significance to his [[House of Isildur|House]] and where he transcribed a [[Ring Verse|verse]] found upon the Ring while it was still hot.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

When Isildur finally felt free to leave he committed the rule of Gondor to Meneldil and with his three sons<ref name=""ta"" /> departed on [[5 September|5]] [[Ivanneth]], {{TA|2}}.  Instead of heading west and then north they journeyed northwards along the Anduin in order to first come to Imladris where his wife and little son Valandil were.<ref name=""Rings"" /> On the thirtieth day of the journey, [[5 October|5]] [[Narbeleth]], the King, his sons, and his Guard of two hundred knights and soldiers reached the northern borders of the [[Gladden Fields]].  Isildur believed that all soldiers of the Enemy perished so his camp was unguarded.<ref name=""Rings"" /> There they were ambushed by a band of [[Orcs]] said to be ten times their number.
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Death of Isildur.jpg|thumb|''The Death of Isildur'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
As the Orcs closed in, Isildur sent his esquire [[Ohtar]] with one companion to fly with the shards of Narsil. The enemy charged and charged again.  One by one Isildur's sons died about him;<ref name=""ta"" /> Elendur was the last and he insisted that Isildur leave with the One Ring. Isildur placed the Ring upon his finger and vanished from the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|battle]].

The Orcs could still sense his smell<ref name=""Rings"" /> and Isildur ran to the Anduin and swam across the river. It was during this effort that the One Ring slipped from his finger.  As he struggled to escape the reeds and rushes on the shore a small party of Orcs spotted him and shot him.  He fell back into the water and no trace of him was found by Elves or Men.<ref name=""Gladden"" />

===Legacy===
The [[House of Isildur|line of Isildur]] continued, for Valandil became king of Arnor.  Isildur's line continued unbroken throughout the [[Third Age]] until it formed the basis for [[Aragorn]]'s claim to the kingship of Arnor and Gondor after the downfall of Sauron.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

In the riddling rhyme ""''Seek for the Sword that was Broken''"" the Ring is referred to cryptically as ''Isildur's Bane''.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]] the tower of [[Orthanc]] was opened, for King Elessar desired its restoration.  Behind a hidden door in a steel closet was found Isildur's [[Star of Elendil|Elendilmir]].  It was surmised that [[Saruman]] had found the bones of the long-lost king and had taken the ''[[mithril]]'' fillet with its jewel for his own, possibly destroying the king's remains afterwards.<ref name=""Gladden"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Isildur.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Isildur'' is a [[Quenya]] name, meaning ""Servant of the Moon"", from ''[[Isil]]'' (""Moon"") + ''[[-dur]]'' (""servant"").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 28</ref>

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Prince Isildur is mentioned in the [[Prologue: A Ring's Tale (1978 scene)|prologue]], and he is shown to cut the Ring off Sauron's hand in battle, rather than from a defeated Sauron.

'''2001-2002: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Isildur briefly appears in the first scenes of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|the first film]], as well as an extended flashback scene. Isildur is played by [[Harry Sinclair]]. Sinclair, a friend of [[Peter Jackson]], was asked because he was the most corrupt looking person Jackson knew. Sinclair had only one line, ""No!"", which was dubbed by [[Hugo Weaving]]. The story of Isildur's succumbing to the temptation of the Ring bothers Aragorn who fears that he could have the same weakness (a fear that is not evident in the book). In the book, the Ring simply disappeared when Isildur died and nobody knew what had happened to it until it was found by Gollum over 2000 years later.

===Television===
'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''
:Isildur is portrayed by [[Maxim Baldry]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Alice Jones]]|articleurl=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/amazon-the-rings-of-power-series-first-look|articlename=Amazon's Lord of the Rings Series Rises: Inside The Rings of Power
|dated=10-February-2022|website=[https://www.vanityfair.com VanityFair]|accessed=12-February-2022}}</ref> None of the plotlines in which he is involved are found in the books, including his travelling to the Southlands and joining Galadriel's invasion of the Southlands at the head of the Númenorian army. He first appears on the [[Adar (episode)|third episode]] on a ship at sea near [[Númenor]]. He is later presumed dead after a burning log falls on him in the [[Mordor|Southlands]].

===Games===
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)]]'':'''''
:In the game starts with a prologue, where you control Isildur on the slopes of Mount Doom. After you complete the mission you see how Isildur defeats Sauron. By completing the Tower of Orthanc bonus level, Isildur becomes a playable character in the other stages, where he takes the place of his descendant Aragorn. Strangely, Isildur's version of the ""Tower of Orthanc"" level has the same script as Aragorn's, leading to Saruman referring to the ancient King of Gondor as a ""ragtag Ranger"".

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Isildur appears only in cinematics battling [[Sauron]]. However, in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|expansion pack ''The Rise of the Witch-king'']], Isildur is mentioned in more detail in the [[Angmar]] campaign.

'''2007-2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Isildur makes an appearance in a flashback scene titled ""At the Stone of Erech"". It covers the oath given to Isildur by the men of [[Dunharrow]], subsequent return of Sauron several years later, the betrayal of the Dunharrow men and the curse that Isildur lays upon them. He also appears during the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], during the High Elf introduction, as well as in a flashback of the battle.

:With Update 24.2, it is revealed that the Shade of Isildur was saved by Gultháva, the River-maiden of the Gladden, who kept the lost king secluded within a secret grotto in order to protect him from harm. He is encountered after the [[War of the Ring]], in an abandoned dwarf-hold situated above the [[Gladden Fields]].
'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:After Isildur's (voiced by [[Nolan North]]) death, the Orcs brought his body to the diminished and vengeful [[Sauron]], who put a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]] on his finger, reviving him as one of his servants and eventually turning him into a [[Nazgûl]]. As one of the Ringwraiths, Isildur was forced to serve the [[Dark Lord]] for all time, until he was defeated and freed by the game's protagonist, Talion. Later, the Ranger claimed his ring to survive after [[Celebrimbor]] abandoned him, and eventually took Isildur's place among the Nazgûl after holding back Sauron's forces for decades.

'''Orontor''' was a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] [[Men|man]] who was the father of [[Fíriel (The Lost Road)|Fíriel]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.

== History ==
Orontor was a good friend of [[Elendil]], but at some point in time, he had departed [[Númenor]]. Men speculated that he had gained the displeasure of the king and had fled on a long voyage. However, the truth was that he was on a mysterious mission and would likely never be seen again or be seen again too late.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 62</ref> He left behind his daughter, Fíriel, in Elendil's house where she sang a [[Fíriel's song|sad song]] from a high window.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of ''Oronto'' is never given, but it could include the [[Quenya]] element ''[[oron]]'' (""mountain""). The name was created in an early step of Quenya development, but it was later used as an example of ''anessi'' (""given name"").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 86</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] points out that Orontor's mission, ""from which he might never return"", could be a precedent of the voyage of [[Amandil]] to the West in the final version of ''[[Akallabêth]]''.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, ''Note on the Númenórean chapters'', p. 71</ref>

'''Poldor''' was a [[Númenórean]] [[Men|man]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Lost Road]]''. 

He was a peer of [[Herendil]], who complained to his father [[Elendil]] that Poldor had called him ''[[Eärendil|Eärendel]]'' the previous day by way of scorn or mockery.<ref name=P1>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 70, note 5</ref> However, in the lastest draft, Poldor was omitted, and replaced by Herendil's numerous anonymous peers, with Herendil telling his father that his peers called him names such as ''Terendul'' (meaning ""slender and dark"") and accusing him of being a ""half-Noldo.""<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, pp. 59-60</ref>

==Etymology==
''Poldor'' appears to be a [[Quenya]] name, derived from ''pol'' in ''polda'' (""strong, burly"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""POL-, POLOD-""</ref>

'''Azog''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain of [[Moria]], who started the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] when he slew [[Thrór]].<ref name=""Party"" /> He was himself slain by [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], and was succeeded by his son [[Bolg]].<ref name=""App"" /><ref name=""Burst"">{{H|Burst}}</ref>

==History==
Little is known of Azog's origins, but he was the chief of the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs of Moria]], and apparently the most important Orc warlord of the northern lands. The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to Moria by [[Sauron]] in about {{TA|2480}}.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> He had one son, Bolg, who succeeded him after his death.<ref name=""Burst"" />

[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|''Azog and Nár'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]

Azog entered history in the year {{TA|2790|n}} due to [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] Thrór's desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> He entered the [[Great Gates]], but Azog and his orcs captured and slew him, and branded his hewn head with his own name, ""AZOG"". He flung the head at [[Nár]] who waited outside, then a money purse containing ""few coins of little worth"", warning that he would tolerate no future Dwarf beggars entering his domain at Moria.

When news of this reached Thrór's heir [[Thráin]], he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of [[Dwarves]] to seek revenge on Azog. So the War of the Dwarves and Orcs began: the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of constant warfare, the climactic Battle of [[Dimrill Dale|Azanulbizar]] was fought before the gates of Moria itself in the year {{TA|2799|n}}.<ref name=""TA"" />

King Thráin II and his son [[Thorin]] were in that battle, near the end of which, Azog emerged from the inner gate with his guards, Náin was exhausted and half blind with rage. He tried to swing as hard as he could, but Azog darted aside and Náin missed, splintering his mattocks on the ground. The orc kicked him in the leg when he dodged the Dwarf's blow, making him stumble, at which point Azog attempted to thrust and behead him, succeeding only in breaking Náin's neck because of the strong mail he was wearing. At this point, Azog noticed his retreating forces and retreated back inside. As he did, Dáin II chased him up the steps and beheaded him with a single mighty strike, which became forever known as a deed of great valour considering Dáin's young age. Azog's head was impaled on a spike, with the same coin-filled purse stuffed in his mouth that he had flung at Nár after he killed Thrór nine years before.<ref name=""App"" />

Azog's underground dominions in the north, though greatly reduced in the War, fell to his son Bolg, who held them for almost 150 years until he too met his end at the [[Battle of Five Armies]] in the year {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=""Burst"" /><ref name=""TA"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Azog.mp3|Ardamir}}
The meaning and origin of the name ''Azog'' is unknown. It is most likely a name in the [[Black Speech]], though [[Mágol]] may also be a possibility.<ref>{{HM|RB}}, p. 787, note 38</ref>

[[Andreas Moehn]] has noted an apparent but tentative similarity with [[Mannish]], in the [[Adûnaic]] word ''[[zagar]]'' meaning ""sword"", in which case ''Azog'' might refer to ""warrior"" or anything similar.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articleurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151024/http:/lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Atani.html|articlename=Etymologies of the Atani languages|dated=18 July 2002|website=Middle-earth Science Pages (Internet Archive)|accessed=31.7.2019}}</ref>

===Films===
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Azog is played by [[Manu Bennett]] via motion-capture and CG (though he was originally intended to be played by [[Conan Stevens]] in a practical costume and makeup<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150257180211558|articlename=Casting News for The Hobbit|dated=19-May-2011|website=FB|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}).</ref>). He is a white-skinned Orc, known as the Pale Orc or Azog the Defiler. According to [[Balin]], he is from [[Gundabad]]. In the films, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] appears in a flashback. [[Thrór]] is still alive at this time and is beheaded by Azog during the battle. [[Thorin]] fights with Azog and cuts off his left forearm, and the Pale Orc is dragged off by a few fellow [[Orcs]]. Thorin believes Azog to have died from his wounds, but, unlike in the book, he actually survived the battle and serves as Thorin's nemesis. The Pale Orc is also portrayed as a committed and trusted general of [[Sauron|the Necromancer]] - whereas in the source material his allegiance to the [[Dark Lord]] can only be assumed as a likelihood - and he is therefore tasked by his master first with hindering Oakenshield's quest and later with conquering the [[Erebor|Lonely Mountain]].

:In the films, Azog speaks exclusively in [[Orkish]], whereas his literary counterpart was also known to use the [[Common Speech]]. He rides a gigantic [[Warg Matriarch|white warg]]. He also lacks the iron-clad head he featured in the books.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Azog leads a pack of Orcs on Wargs in hunting down [[Thorin and Company]] to wipe out the [[House of Durin|Line of Durin]] and to take his revenge on Thorin for his wound - even putting out a bounty on Thorin's head. In the film, it is his pack (not the Orcs of [[Goblin-town]]) that catch up to the Company on the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]; after a brief fight with Thorin, he loses them when they are rescued by the [[Eagles]].

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:While still in pursuit of Thorin and Company as they come down from the [[Carrock]] and make their way to [[Beorn]]'s house, he is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer himself. Though annoyed that yet again he is unable to track down Oakenshield, Azog submits to his master and agrees to lead his armies to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], sending his son Bolg to pursue the Company in his stead. He later leads an unsuccessful attack on [[Gandalf]] when the [[Wizards|Wizard]] enters the fortress prior to the army's departure.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:In this movie, Azog's appearance is changed, as he now wears plate armor, and he replaced his claw arm with one that looks similar to a sword. Azog is first seen marching on Erebor. When [[Bolg]] tells him of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elven]] Army, he orders him to Gundabad for more troops. From [[Ravenhill]], Azog commands the Orcs in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]] go to kill Azog, in order to leave the Orcs leaderless. But Azog captures Fíli and kills him in front of Thorin. Azog finally battles Thorin on a frozen lake and is knocked underwater. However, he breaks through the ice and stabs Thorin, mortally wounding him. Despite this, the Dwarf leader manages to stab Azog through the chest with [[Orcrist]] - finally killing the Pale Orc - shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.

===Games===
'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Azog appears in an extended flashback depicting the beginning and the end of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. Azog's youngest son ""Komog"" is slain in the halls of [[Gundabad]], while his eldest son ""Urro"" is killed by [[Thorin]] during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in the same engagement that earns him the name ""Oakenshield"". [[Bolg]] survives as his only heir by escaping into [[Moria]] shortly before Azog is killed by Dáin.

:In the present day, Azog's descendants continue to plague Durin's Folk. Bolg's son ""Mazog"", Lord of Moria, is the major antagonist of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansions. Bolg's other son ""Gorgar the Ruthless"", Lord of Gundabad, is the chief antagonist of the ''War of Three Peaks'' expansion.

'''Bolg of the North''' was a vengeful Orc chieftain, son of [[Azog]], who led a great army in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. He was crushed in the ensuing battle by [[Beorn]]. 

==History==
Bolg was the son of Azog,<ref name=H17>{{H|17}}</ref> succeeding his father as a prominent leader of the northern [[Orcs]] after Azog was killed by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in [[Third Age]] {{TA|2799|n}}.<ref name=""App|Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref> This started Bolg's hatred towards the [[Dwarves]] and after the [[Great Goblin]] was killed during an encounter with [[Thorin and Company]] in {{TA|2941}}, the goblins' hatred for them grew even more.<ref name=H17/>

Bolg gathered an army of [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] to their capital at [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]]. They marched eastward through the [[Grey Mountains]] with a host of [[Wargs]] and a cloud of [[bats]] overhead.<ref name=H17/>

Once they reached the [[Lonely Mountain]], Bolg led the Orcs and Wargs into [[Battle of the Five Armies|battle]] with the Dwarves, [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]], and [[Lake-men]]. Surrounding him was his [[Bodyguard of Bolg|bodyguard]] with steel scimitars.<ref name=H17/> When [[Thorin]] attempted to pierce their ranks he became surrounded, and would later die from the wounds he sustained. The [[Eagles]] arrived and after them came [[Beorn]] in the shape of a bear. Beorn killed Bolg and the Orcs and Wargs were soon defeated.<ref>{{H|18}}</ref>

==Etymology==
There have been several attempts to give a meaning of the name ''Bolg''. One is a regular [[Orkish]] treatment of ''[[Boldog]]'', another a connection to [[Westron]] ''[[Bolger Family#Etymology|bolg]]''. 

In ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', a word from a little known and little expanded language, ''[[Mágol]]'', is given, ''bolg'', which means ""strong"". [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] at one time considered making Mágol an Orkish language. An [[wikipedia:Primitive Irish|Ivernian]] word ""bolg"", of unknown meaning, is also cited by [[John D. Rateliff|Rateliff]].<ref>{{HM|RB}}, p. 710</ref>

===Films===
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Bolg was originally going to be played by [[Conan Stevens]] in this film via practical costume.<ref name=""TORNBolg"">{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/04/22/55228-exclusive-hobbits-conan-stevens-chats-with-torn/|articlename=Exclusive: ‘Hobbit’s’ Conan Stevens chats with TORn|dated=22-April-2012|website=TORN|accessed=05-September-2012}}</ref> He makes a brief appearance during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], where he is seen fighting against [[Dwalin]] during the flashback to the battle outside [[Moria]], until he is incapacitated and knocked down. He is, however, never actually identified as being Bolg in the film.<ref group=note>While Bolg was redesigned for motion capture performance and recast for the two following films, Conan Stevens ''does'' reprise this character as the [[Keeper of the Dungeons|Orc dungeon keeper]] at [[Dol Guldur]] in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' who torments [[Gandalf]] as he is imprisoned there. The Orc also attempts to reclaim [[Narya]] from the [[Wizards|Wizard]] for his [[Sauron|master]] right before being vanquished by [[Galadriel]] upon her arrival, though this segment only occurs in the film's [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]].</ref>

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Bolg is played by [[Lawrence Makoare]] via motion capture in this film. Azog - who survives the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] in these films - is summoned to Dol Guldur to become the commander of [[Sauron]]'s [[Orcs|Orc]] armies. While there, [[Azog]] dispatches his son Bolg-who delivere the summons earlier in the film-to take his place in hunting Thorin and Company. With his pack of Orcs, Bolg tracks Thorin and Company through [[Mirkwood]], attacks the Wood-elves as the Company escapes in barrels, and eventually follows the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] to [[Lake-town]].
:At Lake-town, Bolg and a team of stealth-Orcs raid Bard's home in search of the Dwarves, but find only four. When they attack, they are in turn attacked by two [[Elves]]: [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]]. He goes after Legolas, and the two begin a duel (in which the Elf uses [[Orcrist]], the weapon of [[Thorin]]). However, the two adversaries prove to be evenly-matched, so Bolg decides to make his retreat. While Legolas is distracted by other Orcs, Bolg withdraws and rides a Warg down a dock. He is then pursued by Legolas, now on a horse.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Once again performed via motion capture, Bolg is played by [[John Tui]] this time. He is first seen in this film when he meets his father who is leading Sauron's forces to capture [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. When he realises [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] will come to Erebor, Azog sends Bolg to lead a separate Orc army detachment raised in [[Gundabad]]. Arriving with an advance force, he aids his father against Thorin [[Oakenshield]]'s commando team on [[Ravenhill]], nearly kills the Elf Tauriel, and slays the Dwarf [[Kíli]] when he comes to her defence. Soon afterwards, however, he is confronted and killed by Legolas, who drives one of his battle-knives into his head. Bolg's body subsequently falls off the mountain and is crushed by a boulder falling on top of it.

===Games===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bolg.jpg|thumb|180px|Bolg in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Bolg makes two brief appearances in the game's depiction of the Battle of Azanulbizar, and both times he flees without a fight.
'''2023: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Bolg is one of the characters that you can collect, you have to get 45 Bolg shards to get him.

'''Golfimbul''' was a king of the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Orcs]] of [[Mount Gram]].<ref name=""HParty"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

==History==
Golfimbul led a band of Orcs in an invasion of [[the Shire]] in {{TA|2747}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Bandobras Took]] met Golfimbul in the [[Northfarthing]] of [[the Shire]] and defeated him in the [[Battle of Greenfields]]. During the battle Bandobras, who was large enough to ride a horse, charged at Golfimbul and knocked off his head with a club. Golfimbul's head flew through the air for 100 yards and went down a rabbit hole. It is said that this is how the game of [[golf]] was invented.<ref name=""HParty""/>

==Etymology==
Jim Allan suggests that ''Golfimbul'' has a Scandinavian origin, means ""Wind-terrible"" and contains the elements ''Gol-'' (""wind"") and ''Fimbul'' (""might"" or ""great"").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 226</ref>

""Fimbul"" is Old Norse for ""great"".<ref>[[Wikipedia:Fimbulwinter#Etymology]]</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] notes that the connection with the English word ""golf"" suggests that the name is either fictitious or translated [[Westron]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 167</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
At an early stage in writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used the name '''[[Fingolfin]]''' for the Goblin-leader, which also contained the word ""golf"" for the joke about the origin of the game (although not as prominently as in ""Golfimbul"").<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 39</ref> Many years later, in the never-finished 1960 rewrite of the story, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] intended to change the name to '''Gulfimbul'''.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, p. 776</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] speculated that this was either a further evolution of Tolkien's languages or because he was dropping the golf-joke reference.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, note 24, p. 785</ref> The 1960 revision was an effort to ""upgrade"" ''The Hobbit'' to the same epic level as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
===Films===
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:In trying to convince [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] of his [[Tooks|Tookishness]], [[Gandalf]] tells about the story of the [[Battle of Greenfields]], referring to Golfimbul as a Goblin-king.

===Games===
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:In [[Brockenborings]] there is a wooden statue depicting Bandobras standing in a golf pose over Golfimbul's head. Every Spring, [[the Shire]] celebrates Bullroarer Took Day when the Hobbits place tankards of the drink under his statue in his honor.

:The epic book prologue in the Shire involves the player trying to thwart '''Lubach''', who believes that he is the descendant of Golfimbul, from invading the Shire with a group of Goblins. He dwells in a landmark in the Greenfields referred to as '''Golfimbul's Hole'''.

'''Gorbag''' was the captain of the [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] of [[Minas Morgul]]. He served the [[Nazgûl]] who dwelt in the Dead City.  

== History ==
During the peak of the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Silent Watchers]] exhibited unease because a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], [[Frodo Baggins]], had passed by them. Gorbag and a patrol then, left Minas Morgul and were sent to [[Cirith Ungol]] where [[Shagrat]] was in command.<ref name=""Choices"">{{TT|IV10}}</ref>

On [[13 March]] {{TA|3019}} Gorbag and Shagrat came across Frodo,<ref name=""Great"">{{App|Great}}</ref> now paralyzed by [[Shelob]]. They ordered Frodo carried back into the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] as their prisoner.  

During their return to the tower [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], who was wearing the [[The One Ring|One Ring]], overheard them talking. It quickly became apparent that Gorbag was the more observant of the two, and noticed that the paralyzed halfling's cords were cut, meaning that he had a companion: Shagrat said that the Nazgûl were uneasy and that something nearly slipped, and Gorbag corrected him saying that something ''had'' slipped; Shagrat pointed out that Shelob got the halfling, but Gorbag pointed out that he was not alone, as someone else cut the cords from Frodo. Shagrat dismissed Gorbag's reasoning by claiming that he always took a gloomy view.  Shagrat, who had been in the tower longer, was able to tell Gorbag that Frodo was not dead.<ref name=""Choices""/>

On [[14 March]]<ref name=""Great""/> the two Orc leaders stripped Frodo of his possessions.  Upon discovering Frodo's [[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|''mithril'' coat]] Gorbag tried to keep it, which provoked a fight between the underlings of the two leaders.  Gorbag knifed Shagrat, who in return attempted to throttle him. Later he attempted to stab Shagrat with a broken spear but Shagrat, hearing him, then stabbed him in the throat and trampled on his body.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

The '''Great Goblin''' was the chief of the [[Orcs#Orcs and goblins|Orcs]] who dwelt in [[Goblin-town]] beneath the [[High Pass]], and presumably was the leader of all the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry ""Great Goblin""</ref> He was described as ""tremendous"" and had a huge head.<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref>

== History ==
In {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were captured by the Great Goblin's people after taking refuge in a [[Front Porch|cave]] while crossing the [[Misty Mountains]]. When the [[Dwarves]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] were hauled before the Great Goblin he questioned them regarding their intentions, while accusing them of being spies, thieves, murderers, and friends of [[Elves]]. When one of his guards showed the Great Goblin [[Thorin]]'s sword, [[Orcrist]], he howled with rage and rushed at Thorin with open mouth. At that moment all of the lights in the cave were extinguished and a flashing sword stabbed the Great Goblin fatally. The company soon realized that it was [[Gandalf]] who had killed the Great Goblin with his blade [[Glamdring]].<ref name=""Hill""/>

== Legacy ==
The death of the Great Goblin - along with Gandalf's ploy of introducing Thorin's company only a few at a time - tickled [[Beorn]]'s fancy enough to gain the Company access to his hall and hospitality. Once Beorn confirmed their tale he warmed up to true friendship and provided the party with aid, advice, and mounts to ride to the border of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

A further consequence of the Great Goblin's demise was a rekindling of the Orcs' hatred towards Dwarves, which led to preparations for war to secure domination of the North. The Orcs assembled at Mount [[Gundabad]] and were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of [[Smaug]]. Altering their plans, the Orcs marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], almost immediately after the arrival of [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and participated in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

:In the console versions, the Great Goblin is mentioned but never seen, since Bilbo is separated from the Dwarves before they meet the Great Goblin. However, he's seen in the GBA version, his appearance closely matching his description in the novel. In the latter version, he immediately orders the execution of Thorin and the others after Thorin pleads his case, instead of after the revelation that he has [[Orcrist]] in his possession, before being killed by Gandalf.

'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Multiple other goblins claim the mantle of the Great Goblin during the [[War of the Ring]]. A running joke in the game is that none of the claimants can stand up to the original Great Goblin; all end up swiftly defeated and as the next goblin rises up to claim the title, the cycle continues.

:The Great Goblin, also referred to as the '''Goblin King''', recognizes Thorin immediately, and is greatly interested in him because of the bounty put on him by [[Azog]].

On [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=""Great"">{{App|Great}}</ref> Grishnákh was part of a raiding party that captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] at [[Parth Galen]]. He was the captain of a group of Mordor-orcs which had joined [[Uglúk]]'s forces on the plains of [[Rohan]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. When Pippin awoke and heard the Orcs arguing he noted that Grishnákh's voice sounded softer but more evil than the others. Grishnákh threatened to report the doings of the mountain-orcs and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz ([[Barad-dûr]]).<ref name=""Uruk""/>

On [[28 February]]<ref name=""Great""/> Grishnákh and his followers split from Uglúk's company to head east, but fell back in with the [[Orcs of Isengard|Isengarders]] when [[Éomer]]'s riders drew near. In the nighttime when he had a chance, Grishnákh attempted to search the hobbits for [[the One Ring]] (how he knew about it is unknown; possibly he was present at the torture and interrogation of [[Gollum]] in Barad-dûr). After hearing Pippin imitate Gollum's croaking noise, he believed they had the One Ring and tried to escape with the two hobbits. Before he could accomplish this he was slain by the Riders of [[Éomer]] near the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=""Uruk""/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The earlier form of the name ''Grishnákh'' used by [[Tolkien]] was ''Gríshnák''.<ref>{{TI|XXI}}, p. 409. Cf. also Index</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Grishnákh.jpg|thumb|left|Grishnákh in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]

'''[[1978]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:No individual orcs are identified - or identifiable, but one orc yells ""Grishnákh"" to another when they are surrounded by the [[Rohirrim]]. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] also tells one orc (as with the book) that if the Ring goes to Isengard there will be nothing ""for poor Grishnákh"".

'''[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Grishnákh is played by [[Stephen Ure]]. He is a common orc who is crushed by [[Treebeard]] after he attempts to kill Merry and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. 

'''2002: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Grishnákh is provided by Eduard Vitek.

'''[[2004]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Grishnákh is a captain in the evil faction. He is voiced by [[David Lodge]].

'''Orc-hunters'''<ref name=identity>''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 74</ref> were [[Orcs]] which excelled in tracking<ref name=shadow>{{RK|VI2}}, pp. 924-6</ref> that roamed the regions of [[Beleriand]] and [[Middle-earth]] under the rule of [[Morgoth]] and later [[Sauron]].

== History ==
Sometime in or prior to the year {{FA|496}} during the late [[First Age]], one particular band of Orc-hunters roamed the region of [[Methiriad]] near the [[Nivrim|West March]] of the [[Doriath]].<ref>{{UT|2i}}</ref>

In the year 496 after the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] erased [[Nienor]]'s memory, [[Mablung]] and his company found her on [[Amon Ethir]] and began to make their way slowly back to Doriath. After many days, they reached a guarded bridge over the [[Taeglin]] and decided to rest there. However, a roaming ""band of Orc-hunters"" attacked them unawares, causing Nienor to flee into [[Brethil]] in terror and confusion. When the Orc-hunters pursued her, she outran them and they were overtaken and killed by the [[Elves]].<ref name=band>{{CH|14}}</ref>

On [[16 March]] in the year {{TA|3019}} of the late [[Third Age]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] spied two Orc-hunters<ref name=identity/> near the [[Sauron's Road|Barad-dûr Road]]<ref>''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 148</ref> having a disagreement twenty paces away from them regarding their mission. One of them stated that their bosses [[Barad-dûr|Higher Up]] kept changing their target; from an Elf to a [[Dwarves|dwarf]]-[[Men|man]], to even ""a pack of rebel [[Uruk-hai]]"" in the context of the [[Battle of Cirith Ungol|quarrel]] in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. As a result of this, he suggested that it could be all three put together in fact. Following the disagreement, the snuffling Orc skillfully killed the larger one with an arrow and ran off to a nearby [[Orc-holds|Orc-hold]].<ref name=shadow/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In a sketch predating the earliest form of the story of [[Túrin]], Nienor was driven into some woods by a baneful drink given to her by [[Kurúki]],<ref name=Kurúki>{{LT2|IIn}}, pp. 138-40</ref> instead of a group of Orc-hunters<ref name=band/>.

In a discarded revision of chapter five of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Gollum]] is described as a ""foul orc-<illegible>"" by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. [[John D. Rateliff]] notes that, though the second half of the word is illegible, it was probably ""hunter"" and not ""thing"" because the word lacked ""a descender at the end"".<ref>{{HH|1947}}, i. ''Proposed correction of Hobbit to simplify Sequel (Gollum does not give ring).'', note 37</ref>

'''Shagrat''' was an [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]] commanding the garrison of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

== History ==
During a patrol to [[Shelob's Lair]], Shagrat's company encountered a troop of Orcs from [[Minas Morgul]] led by [[Gorbag]]. The two did not get along, but before things escalated, they noted something out of place: a [[Frodo Baggins|strange small creature]], all wound up in [[Shelob]]'s webs. The discovery of what appeared to be an undersized [[Elves|Elf]] led the two commanders to compare their notes; they concluded that there must have been another nearby. But they could not find this ""great Elf warrior"". 

Turmoil rose again amongst the group when Gorbag and Shagrat disagreed with what they had to do with the prisoner. Shagrat's orders from [[Sauron|above]] were simple: all personal effects were to be sent to [[Barad-dûr]]. Shagrat did not trust many of his own troops, and none of Gorbag's, so he locked up the prisoner in the top chamber of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{TT|IV10}}, pp. 735-42</ref>

Gorbag coveted the [[Mithril-coat]] Frodo wore and attempted to usurp Shagrat's rule, but lost to Shagrat's superior numbers. Soon, Gorbag's faction was pressed back. Shagrat eventually killed [[Gorbag]] and ran off to Sauron with the prisoner's belongings.<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, pp. 905-7</ref> He reached [[Barad-dûr]] three days later, on [[17 March]].<ref>{{App|Great}}, p. 1094</ref> After Shagrat brought him the news and items, Sauron slew him.<ref>{{HM|Scheme}}, ""The Land of Shadow"", p. 608</ref>

:[[Chris Fairbank]] played Shagrat.  He is overheard by Sam discussing [[Shelob]] with [[Gorbag]], and then Sam encounters him again on the stairs in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

'''[[1989]]: [[Crack of Doom Software Adventure|''Crack of Doom'' Software Adventure''']]
:Shagrat is simply referred to in-game as a ""large angry Orc"". He is carrying a long red knife and a black bundle. He can be killed by Sam.

'''[[2003]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:[[Peter Tait]] played Shagrat. In this adaptation, it is Shagrat and not Gorbag who covets the ''[[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|mithril]]'' shirt and starts the fight. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], he is shown escaping with the ''mithril'' shirt, which is then presented later by the [[Mouth of Sauron]] to the Captains of the West. It is unclear if this means Shagrat had changed his mind and brought the shirt to [[Barad-dûr]], or if he was waylaid by Orcs loyal to Sauron during his escape, and the shirt was confiscated.

'''[[2008]]: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:In this adaptation, Shagrat first appears on a ledge cackling overlooking [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] after Gollum's initial betrayal. During the very next cutscene, he strikes, pinning Sam to the ground to prevent him from warning Frodo about [[Shelob]]. Despite this, he is a playable character during the [[Shelob]] boss fight solely for the purposes of making a solo moment in the films multiplayer. Similar to the films, it is Shagrat and not Gorbag who covets the ''[[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|mithril]]'' shirt and starts the fight in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Abscent from the main storyline, Shagrat only makes a brief cameo appearance in a scene depicting how [[Gollum]] was released from [[Barad-dûr]].

An [[Orcs|Orc]], addressed as '''Snaga''', was part of the garrison of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. He was one of the few survivors of the [[Battle of Cirith Ungol]]<ref name=""Tower"">{{RK|VI1}}</ref> on [[14 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

Snaga was running down the stairs of the tower when he encountered what he thought was a ""[[Samwise Gamgee|Great Elf-warrior]]"" on the stairs.  Spinning around, he fled back the way he came.  The ""Great Elf-warrior"" was actually [[Samwise Gamgee]] who followed the Orc, although being tired he fell behind his foe.

Snaga came upon [[Shagrat]], who ordered him to send word to [[Sauron]] that they captured a [[Frodo Baggins|Halfling]]. Snaga refused, and after a short chase, made his way to the top of the tower. There, he lashed the prisoner, [[Frodo Baggins]], with a whip. He was quickly overcome by [[Samwise Gamgee]], and fell through the trap door to his death.<ref name=""Tower""/>

== Etymology ==
Snaga was a contemptuous term for the lesser [[Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] and [[Isengard]], used especially among the larger and stronger [[Uruk-hai]]. It comes from a word in the [[Black Speech]] meaning 'slave' or 'servant'.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 79</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Two Orcs appear in the role of Snaga, though none are called or credited as such. Sam encounters one on the stairs, who runs, trips and falls to his doom. A second orc is lashing Frodo. After a short fight, he too falls to his doom.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' 
:Snaga was voiced by [[Gordon Reid]].

'''[[1989]]: [[Crack of Doom Software Adventure|''Crack of Doom'' Software Adventure''']]
:Snaga is simply referred to in-game as a ""small rat-faced Orc"", and is armed with a short knife. Like in the book, he will flee upon first seeing Sam, leading the player on a short chase through the tower until he reaches the ""[[Shagrat|large angry Orc]]"". He can be killed by Sam.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''
:Like in the animated film, Snaga's role is seemingly filled by more than one Orc. First, Sam encounters a trio of Uruk-hai on the stairs, before slaying all three of them. Later, [[Gorbag]] (who survives the battle in this adaptation) fulfills the latter role as the Orc that threatens Frodo before being killed by Sam.

'''Uglúk''' was an [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]] captain in the service of [[Saruman]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. The company of [[orcs of Isengard]] under his leadership killed [[Boromir]], captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and attempted to bring them to [[Isengard]].

==History==
On [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}} Uglúk was the leader of the [[Orcs|Orc-company]] that attacked the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] on the slopes of [[Amon Hen]], slew Boromir and carried off Merry and Pippin.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|Great}}</ref>

Uglúk and his fellow Isengarders were servants of the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]], whom he called the Wise and respected him for his giving of man’s-flesh to eat.  However, not all of his company were from Isengard – the group contained a contingent of Orcs from [[Mordor]] led by [[Grishnákh]] and a party of Northerners from [[Moria]].  Uglúk's orders had been to kill all of the Fellowship except the Halflings, who were to be brought back to Isengard and Saruman alive, captured and unspoiled, as quickly as possible.  Grishnákh's orders were the same, except that his destination was to be Lugbúrz ([[Barad-dûr]]) and [[Sauron]].  The Northerners had no orders; they had come from the Mines for vengeance and killing, followed by a quick return to the north. [[File:Cor Blok - Uglúk.jpg|thumb|left|""Uglúk"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]Not long after the capture of the hobbits these conflicting aims led to a brief fight in which some of the Mordor-orcs and Moria-orcs were slain.  Uglúk won and was able to impose his will; his Orc-company headed west while Grishnákh's group withdrew.<ref name=""Uruk"">{{TT|III3}}</ref>
 [[File:Richard Sullivan - Ugluk.jpg|thumb|right| Richard Sullivan - ''Uglúk'']]
On the evening of [[26 February]]<ref name=""TA"" /> Uglúk learned that a single horseman of [[Rohan]] had been spotted but had not been stopped.  Realizing that pursuit by the [[Rohirrim]] would swiftly follow he applied medicine on Merry's wound and forced drinks down both hobbits' throats. He then cut their leg bonds so that they could run with the company.  When the Northerners objected to his plan to keep on running by daylight Uglúk promised that they would run with him behind them, and he ran at the rear to keep an eye on all of his company.<ref name=""Uruk"" />
 
Despite the fast pace set by Uglúk on [[28 February]]<ref name=""TA"" /> an [[Éored]] of mounted [[Men]] began to overtake the Orcs.  Near the [[Entwash]] most of the Northerners broke away and dashed off towards the [[Misty Mountains]].  At the same time Grishnákh returned with a couple of score of fellow Mordor-orcs. Due to the threat from the riders the two Orc-companies combined and headed for the forest.  As they sped along they caught up with the Northerners who perforce rejoined Uglúk's command.
 
Despite all the speed they could muster the Orcs, now numbering two hundred, were surrounded just three furlongs from the eaves of the forest.  The hemmed-in Orcs began to grumble against Uglúk until he assured them that reinforcements led by an Orc named [[Mauhúr]] were close at hand.  As the night wore on the Riders made a sortie against the Orcs.  Uglúk led his Isengarders to stem the attack, which gave Grishnákh the opportunity to attempt to steal away with the two hobbits.<ref name=""Uruk"" />
 
Grishnákh was killed and the hobbits escaped just as Mauhúr tried but failed to break the encirclement.  Merry and Pippin fled into the woods as the Éored attacked at dawn on [[29 February]].<ref name=""TA"" />  In the ensuing battle Uglúk almost broke through the Riders with a wedge of soldiers, but he was brought to bay at the very edge of the woods and slain by [[Éomer]] in a hand-to-hand sword fight.<ref name=""Uruk"" />
 
Uglúk died not knowing that the two hobbits he had captured did not have [[the One Ring]].  As [[Gandalf]] later noted, Uglúk's efforts would unwittingly lead to the downfall of Saruman.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

==Appearance==
Uglúk was a large black orc.<ref name=""Uruk"" /> Being an Uruk, he was larger and stronger than the other Orcs and he was not bothered by sunlight. Uglúk bore the symbol of the [[White Hand]] of [[Saruman]]. Like the other Isengard Uruk-hai, Uglúk carried a great bow and a short broad-bladed sword.

'''Elfhelm''' was the marshal who governed the Riders and other armed men of the garrison of [[Edoras]] from {{TA|3012|n}} to {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref name=""UTapp"">{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref> He led his [[Éored]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. After the funeral of king [[Théoden]], he was made [[Marshal of the East-mark]] of [[Rohan]] by King [[Éomer]].<ref name=""UTapp"" />

==History==
In the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on [[25 February]] {{TA|3019}}, Elfhelm had been riding in haste from Edoras, leading four companies in answer to Théodred's summons. When he reached the junction of the horse-road and the [[Deeping-road|road]] down from the Deeping, his outriders reported that two [[wolf-riders]] had been seen abroad on the fields. Sensing that something was amiss, he did not turn aside to [[Helm's Deep]] for the night as he had intended but rode with all speed towards the [[Fords of Isen]]. And though his men and horses were weary, as he came in sight of the east banks, he ordered his companies to charge.<ref name=""Isen"">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> The king's son, [[Théodred]], was struck down by a great orc-man just as [[Grimbold]] reach him on a knoll east of the river. Grimbold himself was in mortal peril but Elfhelm, leading four companies of riders, charged in and saved his life. Together Elfhelm and Grimbold found that Théodred was still alive, but only long enough to speak his last words.

Prior to the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on 2 March, the news of Théodred's death caused [[Erkenbrand]] of [[Westfold]] to assume command of the [[West-mark]]. He kept Grimbold in charge of the field. Elfhelm, of the [[Muster of Edoras]], remained independent, but coordinated his efforts with Grimbold. Elfhelm deemed the Fords to be a trap and set his companies to the east of the river to hold up the enemy's advance (that they would advance soon was an opinion shared by both men). Grimbold put foot-soldiers on both sides of the Fords with Théodred's remaining cavalry on the east bank.

When the Second Battle began [[Saruman]]'s forces heavily engaged the western forts and put troops of Uruks across the Fords. Grimbold had to retreat to the eastern bank of the Isen. At midnight Saruman's forces, now reinforced, attacked. Grimbold looked for aid from Elfhelm but none came; the greater part of Saruman's host came between Grimbold and Elfhelm and drove the latter eastwards.<ref name=""Isen""/> At this point [[Gandalf]] appeared and gave orders that Elfhelm ride to Edoras.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, note 17</ref>

After the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], at [[Harrowdale]], Elfhelm was assigned to lead the first ''éored'' of the Muster of the [[East-mark]].<ref name=""UTapp""/> During the ride to [[Gondor]] the men of Elfhelm's command ignored [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] riding with [[Dernhelm]]. Eventually Elfhelm spoke to Merry after he tripped over him in the dark and told him that the drums he heard were those of the [[Woses]] in [[Drúadan Forest]]. After the ride through these woods Elfhelm described to the king and [[Éomer]] the lay of the land just before [[Minas Tirith]] since he had been there in days of peace. Just before the charge across the [[Pelennor Fields]] ([[25 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}) King Théoden placed Elfhelm and his command on the right.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> After the initial charge, the right wing of the Rohirrim was closest to the walls of Minas Tirith and Elfhelm's riders tore into the [[Orcs]] about the siege-engines and drove their foes into the fire-pits.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]], Elfhelm led three thousand Rohirrim up towards the Drúadan Forest, to destroy the last foes left of Mordor's force that had crossed the [[Anduin]] and had been assigned to block the northward road.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> These Orcs and [[Easterlings]] actually were leaving [[Anórien]] by the time Elfhelm's riders caught up with them and they fled to [[Cair Andros]].<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>

Elfhelm was one of the chief witnesses at the coronation of [[Aragorn]] on [[1 May]], {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> King Éomer appointed Elfhelm to the new title [[Marshal of the East-mark]] that he created.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 470</ref>

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A [[Decipher]] card identifies a background character in Edoras from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' as Elfhelm.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Elfhelm comes from the village of Faldham in the [[Eastemnet]]. Eflhelm himself first appears during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], arriving too late to save Prince Théodred's life. During the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] Eflhelm and his men are cut off from [[Erkenbrand]] and he orders a retreat. [[Grimbold]] refuses to follow him, continuing to fight on and defend Théodred's grave, and Elfhelm has no choice but to leave him behind, even though he feels terrible for it. After [[Gandalf]] found Elfhelm and ordered Elfhelm to ride to Edoras, he makes a brief stop in Grimbold's home town of [[Grimslade]] and, after making short work of Saruman's orcs harassing it, brings Grimbold's wife Hildith the news of her husband, apologizing for not doing more for him.
:Elfhelm is next met during the journey of the Rohirrim through the Druadan Forest. Elfhelm is aware not only that Merry Brandybuck is riding with one of his riders, but also that the rider [[Dernhelm]] is Lady Éowyn herself. After she refused to stay behind in [[Dunharrow]], Elfhelm kept her secret and gave her the sword of her cousin Théodred that he took from the Fords. It was that very sword that Éowyn used to slay the [[Witch-King]] of [[Angmar]], though it broke in doing the deed. Elfhelm is later present during the coronation of King Elessar.

'''2019:''' ''[[Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:Elfhelm received rules and a model as part of the Gondor at War expansion to the Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game, his rules focusing on his skill with a throwing spear.

'''Eorl the Young''' ([[Third Age]] 2485 – 2545, aged 60 years) was the son of [[Léod]] of the [[Éothéod]], and founder of [[Rohan]].<ref name=""Eorl"">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Life==
When Eorl was only 16 years old, his father was killed while trying to tame the horse [[Felaróf]], making Eorl [[Lord of the Éothéod]] at that young age. Young Eorl swore to avenge his father and managed to tame the horse. He ""doomed"" the horse to carry him for the rest of their lives, and the horse seemingly accepted this burden.<ref name=""Eorl""/>

In {{TA|2510}}, [[Borondir|Borondir Udalraph]] came to the north seeking aid, as the [[South-kingdom]] was attacked by the [[Orcs]] and the [[Balchoth]]. On April 15, Eorl came to the [[Field of Celebrant]], and joined the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|battle]]. For his service to [[Gondor]], he was granted [[Calenardhon]] to dwell in. As a return, Eorl and his descendants would have to come to the aid of Gondor when they requested; this was known as the [[Oath of Eorl]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

Eorl ruled from a green hill under the [[White Mountains]].<ref name=""Eorl""/>

Even in his older years Eorl never lost his yellow hair. He died in battle against the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|2545}}. He was buried in the first royal mound, and Felaróf was buried with him.<ref name=""Mark""/>

==Legacy==
Eorl was the founder of Rohan, its first King, the ancestor of the [[House of Eorl]] and all the [[Kings of Rohan]]. His horse Felaróf was the first of the [[Mearas]].

Eorl was known as ""the Young"" because he became [[Lord of the Éothéod]] at the age of 16 and because he never lost his yellow hair.

His Oath would be answered at least thrice: once by [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], once by [[Théoden|Théoden Ednew]] and by [[Éomer]].<ref name=""Mark"">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''Eorl'' is an [[Old English]] translation of genuine [[Rohanese]] '''''þuron''''', which has perhaps influence from [[Elvish]] [[sundocarme|root]] [[TUR]].<ref>{{PE|22}}, p. 159, where Tolkien gives ''þorunahim'' as the genuine form of [[Eorlingas]]</ref>

'''Eorl''' is an Old English word referring to a person of noble rank. It is the ancestor of modern ""earl"". It was the highest rank of nobility in North Germanic culture, not introduced to Britain until the late 9th century, when it replaced the equivalent Old English title ''ealdorman''. The Old Norse equivalent is ''jarl.''<ref>[[Wikipedia:Jarl in Sweden|Jarl in Sweden]] at [[wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]</ref> [[Þórsteinn Thorarensen]] used ''Jarl'' as the name for the character throughout his Icelandic translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', along with [[Helm|Hjálmur]], for Helm, [[Thengel|Þengill]] for Thengel, [[Théoden|Þjódan]] for Théoden, and [[Éomer|Jómar]] for Éomer.<ref>{{VT|42}}, [[Arden R. Smith]], ''Transitions in Translations: Upphaflega íslensk heiti'', pages 35-37</ref> Compare ''[[Ceorl]]'', the second rank.

'''Erkenbrand''' was one of the [[Rohirrim]]. He was the Lord of [[Deeping-coomb]] and of much other land in the [[Westfold]] during the [[War of the Ring]].
 
==History==
Erkenbrand had been an officer in the [[King's Company|King's Riders]] in his youth. At the time of the War of the Ring Erkenbrand was Lord of Deeping-coomb and much other land in the Westfold. As such, he was the chief lord in the [[West-mark]].<ref>{{UT|11b}}, fourth paragraph</ref> He was the uncle of [[Dúnhere]].<ref name=""UTnote13"" />
 
Erkendbrand was in the [[Hornburg]] during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. When news of the death of [[Théodred]] in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}} reached Erkenbrand the next day, he assumed command of the West-mark. Erkenbrand sent errand-riders to [[Edoras]] to inform King [[Théoden]] about the death of Théodred and to request [[Éomer]] and all forces that could be spared as reinforcements. However, [[Gríma]] delayed any actions until he was defeated by [[Gandalf|Gandalf.]]<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, thirteenth paragraph</ref> He gave the command in the field to [[Grimbold]] until he could come himself to the battlefield. Erkenbrand did not immediately go to the battlefield due to the fact that he was occupied for three days gathering all those able to bear arms and stores of food to defend the Hornburg.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, fourteenth paragraph</ref>

On [[2 March]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] was fought, and the defences on the [[Isen]] were driven back by [[Saruman]]'s forces. The survivors, led by Grimbold and [[Elfhelm]], were retreating from the fords of the river Isen when they came across Gandalf. Gandalf told them Théoden sought the refuge of the Hornburg, and that they should join Erkenbrand to attack the besiegers.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> They arrived with a thousand men at dawn of [[4 March|March 4]], {{TA|3019}} and turned the tide of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=""Deep"">{{TT|Deep}}</ref> 

Erkenbrand did not come to [[Minas Tirith]] to fight in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. King Théoden gave him the command of the forces that were left behind to defend Rohan because of Erkenbrand's dignity and authority.<ref>{{UT|11b}} , second author's note to the Muster of the West-mark in the sixth paragraph</ref>

After the funeral of King Théoden, which took place on 10 August, {{TA|3019}} , King Éomer appointed Erkenbrand to the post of [[Marshal of the West-mark]].<ref>{{UT|11b}}, first sentence of the last paragraph</ref>

==Appearance==
Erkenbrand was said to have been tall and strong with a red shield and a great black horn. King Théoden said that the valour of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] lived again in Erkenbrand.<ref name=""Deep"" />

==Etymology==
''Erkenbrand'' is a name that possibly was derived from two [[Old English]] words: ''eorcan'' (""precious"") and ''brand'' (""fire-brand, torch; sword"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413</ref>

After a brief regrouping, Gandalf then leads them on the march towards the Hornburg.

'''Fréaláf Hildeson''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2726|n}} – {{TA|2798|n}}, aged 72 years) was the tenth [[King of Rohan]], and the first King of the second line. 

==History==
Fréaláf was the son of [[Hild]], and thus the sister-son of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. When [[Rohan]] was invaded by the [[Dunlendings]] led by [[Wulf]] in {{TA|2758}}, Fréaláf was among the [[Rohirrim]] who took refuge in [[Dunharrow]]. However King Helm and his sons were killed in the invasion and the siege of the [[Hornburg]] in {{TA|2759|n}}, and Fréaláf was his heir.

Early in the spring Fréaláf led a daring surprise raid against the Dunlendings that recaptured [[Edoras]] and managed to reclaim it. With aid from [[Gondor]], he eventually drove the [[Dunlendings]] back across both the rivers [[Isen]] and [[Adorn]], freeing all of Rohan.<ref name=""Eorl"">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>  Those Dunlendings who had occupied [[Isengard]] were starved until they capitulated and left the fortress.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>

At his coronation the [[Wizard]] [[Saruman]] suddenly appeared after years of absence. Saruman offered Fréaláf his support and friendship which Fréaláf accepted, as Rohan was just recovering from the war and the [[Long Winter]]. On Fréaláf's advice, [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], lent Saruman the keys to [[Orthanc]], giving him Isengard to dwell in on the condition that he must protect it from another conquest by the Dunlendings.

He ruled for 39 years, and was succeeded by his son [[Brytta|Brytta Léofa]] at his death in 2798.<ref name=""Eorl""/>

==Etymology==
''Fréaláf'' is an [[Old English]] name. It means ""surviving lord"" and consists of ''fréa'' (""lord"") and ''laf'' (""leaving"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref>

'''Gríma Wormtongue''' was the chief counsellor of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]] and the son of [[Gálmód]].<ref name=""Golden"" /> He became [[Saruman]]'s mole at the court of [[Edoras]], relaying to him the happenings in realm as well as weakening Théoden with his words and poisons. His treachery revealed and unwilling to ride to war against the [[Sauron|Enemy]], Gríma fled to [[Isengard]] and later to the [[Shire]], where he slew his abusive master only to be shot down by the [[Hobbits]]' arrows.

==History==
Gríma son of Gálmód was the advisor of Théoden, King of Rohan in the late [[Third Age]]. At some point, Gríma was ensnared by the corrupted [[Istari|Wizard]] Saruman, who had promised him [[Éowyn]] in exchange for the former acting as his spy and agent. Gríma not only informed Saruman about the secrets and movements of Rohan, but also actively worked to weaken the ailing Théoden with his deceitful counsels and subtle poisons administered as remedies for the easing of old age. Seeing that [[Théodred]] and [[Éomer]] were the main obstacles to the Wizard's takeover of the kingdom, Gríma tried to cause disagreement between the two men and when he failed, he instead resolved to paint Théodred as a soft-hearted heir and Éomer as a power-hungry warmonger in the clouded mind of Théoden. Wormtongue's exploits allowed Saruman to aid Rohan's enemies and amass a significant host in Isengard unfettered, much to both the [[Dark Lord]] Sauron's and his own advantage. 
[[File:April Lee - Twisted Tales.jpg|thumb|left|200px|""Twisted Tales"" by [[:Category:Images by April Lee|April Lee]]]]
During the [[War of the Ring]], the Nine [[Nazgûl]] came to Rohan on their hunt for the [[Ring-bearer]] and stumbled upon Gríma on their way, the latter whom was hurrying to Isengard to tell Saruman of the Wizard [[Gandalf]]'s arrival in Edoras. Terrified, Wormtongue answered their questioning with those same news that the Grey Pilgrim had passed through Rohan, and also told them where the [[The Shire|Shire]] was and how to reach it. He also revealed that Saruman had lied to them in order to deny them this information, a sign of his only half-hearted faith to their common master, Sauron. Seeing that Wormtongue would not betray their interrogation of him to the Wizard and believing his opportunism may continue to be of use to the Dark Lord and do harm to the treacherous Wizard, the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] spared Gríma's life.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>
[[File:Cor Blok - Gríma dismissed.jpg|thumb|200px|left|""Gríma dismissed"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
Upon Gandalf's second coming to Edoras, Gríma tried to discredit him, until the White Wizard managed to heal Théoden. After this, ""many things which men had missed"" were found locked in Gríma's trunk and he was given a grim choice: ride into battle with his liege and so prove his good faith or into exile.<ref name=""Golden"">{{TT|III6}}</ref> Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at [[Orthanc]], where he witnessed the disastrous [[Battle of Isengard]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he mistakenly threw a ""heavy rock""&mdash;which was actually the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' [[Orthanc-stone|of Orthanc]]&mdash;at either his master or the outsiders, for ""he couldn't decide which he hated the most"". Saruman seems to have punished him severely for this act.<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Saruman is Overtaken.jpg|thumb|left|''Saruman is Overtaken'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
While being held in [[Orthanc]], Gríma became weak and thin and was subjected to Saruman's mistreatment of him. When [[Treebeard]] released him and Saruman in August, they left and headed west. On their way, they were confronted by Gandalf, [[Celeborn]], [[Galadriel]] and the Hobbits on their way to northern [[Dunland]]. They found them as travelling beggars and Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, as he exclaimed how he hated his master. Galadriel told Gríma that he was free to leave him whenever he wished but he did not reply and he continued to follow the Wizard.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

Saruman had already been exerting his control over the Shire from afar by sending [[ruffians|evil Men]] there and puppeteering [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]'s rise to power, thus the fallen Wizard sought his revenge in petty tyranny as ""Sharkey"" over the Hobbits who indirectly ensured his downfall. During this time Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, almost resembling [[Gollum]], and Saruman shortened his nickname to ""Worm"" in derision. During this time he murdered the now-useless Lotho on his master's orders, and may have eaten him.<ref name=""RKVI8"">{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
[[File:Valera Lutfullina - Nasty End.jpg|thumb|250px|right|""Nasty End"" by [[:Category:Art by Valera Lutfullina|Valera Lutfullina]]]]
The return of [[Frodo Baggins]] and his companions to the Shire resulted in the Hobbits rallying against the brigands and overthrowing Sharkey. Spurred by the words of Frodo that he did not have to follow Saruman, and being pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him yet again, Gríma used a hidden knife to slit the throat of his oppressor from behind and then darted down the road. He was quickly shot dead by several Hobbit arrows, and thus Wormtongue was the final casualty of the War of the Ring, an unhappy and short-lived wretch who sold his soul to the side of the Enemy and paid the price for his folly.<ref name=""RKVI8"" />

==Etymology==
''Gríma'' means ""mask"", ""visor"", ""helmet"" or ""spectre"" in [[Old English]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 404</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/17508|articlename=gríma|accessed=24 July 2025}}</ref> According to [[Jim Allan]] this is a good name for a traitor who hides his true face as well as his lust for Éowyn.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names"", p. 217</ref>

''Wormtongue'' is a modernised form of [[Old English]] ''wyrm-tunge'' (""snake-tongue"").<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Wormtongue''', p. 764</ref>

==Inspiration==
J. Allard suggests that Gríma was based on or inspired by Unferth from ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', a character that sits near King Hrothgar and serves as a taunter.<ref>J. Allard, ''Beowulf and Other Stories'' (2014) p. 45-7</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
When initially conceived, the character is introduced as ""a wizened [struck out: old] figure of a man with a pale wise face"". While he is first named ""Wormtongue"", his ""true name"" is initially ''Frána''.<ref>{{TI|King}}</ref>{{rp|386}}

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Paul Brooke]] played Gríma.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from [[The Hunt for the Ring]] when he is questioned by the Nazgûl on his way to Isengard. His death at Bag End is also included in the final episode.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Gríma Wormtongue is played by Karl Lieffen.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Gríma is played by [[Brad Dourif]]. The reason for Gríma's pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Saruman he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Gollum to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Wormtongue was one of the ""bad guys"" in what may seem a large and confusing cast of characters to the audience.

:The events of ""[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"" do not appear in the film version, so Saruman's death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the Tower of [[Orthanc]], the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. Saruman's body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his infernal machines. Gríma himself is shot by an arrow fired by Legolas, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Saruman blamed Gríma for killing [[Théodred]], replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.

'''Théoden''' was the seventeenth [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]], ruling for 39 years, from {{TA|2980}} until his death. He was the last of the Second Line.<ref name=""Mark"">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==History==
===Early life===
Théoden was the only son of [[Thengel]], the heir of king [[Fengel]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Morwen of Lossarnach]], a descendant of a former [[Prince of Dol Amroth|prince]] of the fief of [[Belfalas]].<ref name=""Mark"" /><ref name=""Linear"">{{UT|Linear}}</ref> His father left Rohan when he came to manhood and lived long in Gondor. Théoden had been born in [[Gondor]] and spent at least the first five years of his life there with his mother and father until his father was called back to Rohan after the death of Théoden's grandfather Fengel.

[[Westron]],<ref name=""DwarvesIntro"">{{PM|XIntro}}</ref> the ""speech of Gondor"", was used in his father's house in Rohan<ref name=""Mark"" />{{rp|1069}}. Théoden spoke Westron as his native language<ref name=""DwarvesIntro"" /> and he also spoke [[Rohanese]] and [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 2, p. 316</ref> It is not known if Sindarin and Rohanese were his native languages or his acquired languages. His mother Morwen was a ""lady of Gondor of high Númenórean descent"".<ref name=""Linear"" /> In Gondor all men of high lineage and all those who learned how to read and write used Sindarin, even as a daily language, and it is said that in some families Sindarin was the native language.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 296</ref>

Théoden loved his sister [[Théodwyn]] dearly. After she and her husband both died he adopted her children [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]] as his own. He had a son, [[Théodred]], whose mother [[Elfhild]] died in childbirth.<ref name=""Mark"" />

Théoden became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2980}}.<ref name=""Mark"" />

In {{TA|3014}} Théoden's health began to fail. This was caused by the spells of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]].<ref name=""Mark"" /> This may have been due to natural causes as he was then sixty-six, though Rohirrim often lived past eighty, or it may have been induced or increased by subtle poisons administered by [[Gríma]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> Gríma (or ''Wormtongue'' as most others in the [[Riddermark|Mark]] called him), was secretly in the employ of Saruman.

===War of the Ring===
As the war approached Théoden was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands completely, and Gríma became increasingly powerful. Rohan was troubled again by [[Orcs]] and [[Dunlendings]], who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from [[Isengard]]. 

His only son, Théodred, had only recently been slain by Saruman's forces during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. Théoden ordered Éomer against hunting Orcs that crossed Rohan but Éomer went to the foray against his orders.<ref name=""appB"">{{App|Great}}</ref> On Gríma's orders Éomer had been arrested and imprisoned for this.<ref name=""Hall"">{{TT|III6}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]] appeared before him on [[2 March]], the [[Wizards|Wizard]] healed the king. He then restored his nephew, who would become his heir, took up his [[Herugrim|sword]], and led the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]] to the [[Fords of Isen]], against Saruman.<ref name=""appB"" /> 

On their way, they received news that [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|the border was lost]] and he retreated into [[Helm's Deep]] where they were attacked by Saruman's forces on [[3 March]].<ref name=""appB"" /> Théoden won the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and after this he became known as '''Théoden Ednew''', the Renewed,<ref name=""Mark"" /> because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.

After the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Théoden visited [[Isengard]], where he witnessed [[Gandalf]] deposing Saruman from [[Wizards|their order]]. During the parley before the tower of [[Orthanc]], [[Saruman]] attempted to deceive Théoden with false offers of peace and friendship. When Théoden rejected him, [[Saruman]] mockingly referred to him as a ""'''Horsemaster'''"" as an insult<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref><ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>. On their way back to Rohan, they stopped by the [[Helm's Deep]], where he noticed that the lonely [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of their company, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] felt out of place, and offered to ride with him for the rest of the journey. The hobbit was delighted, as he felt useless among the Riders and offered Théoden his sword in service of Rohan.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

On [[6 March]] Théoden and the Riders left Hornburg for [[Harrowdale]] taking a safe path to Edoras, and soon after [[Aragorn]] left the Rohirrim's company for [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=""appB"" /> Near the outer hills of Rohan, Théoden dismissed Éomer's urge not to go to the war, and with the remaining Riders he rode to the Hold of Dunharrow where his people took shelter at [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=""muster"">{{RK|V3}}</ref>

===Fulfilling the Oath of Eorl===
[[File:Paula DiSante - The Red Arrow.JPG|thumb|[[Paula DiSante]] - ''The Red Arrow'']]
After reuniting with Éowyn and while resting, a [[Gondorian]] named [[Hirgon]] entered his tent, bringing the [[Red Arrow]] from [[Denethor]] II. Théoden responded to him that 6000 Riders would reach [[Minas Tirith]] in the week. Indeed they set off the [[Dawnless Day|next morning]]; before leaving he ordered his squire, Meriadoc, to stay behind at Edoras.<ref name=""muster"" />

On their way to Minas Tirith, Théoden's forces were alerted to a host of Orcs upon the road from the city moving towards them. A leader of the [[Woses]], [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], offered to lead the Rohirrim by secret paths through the [[Drúadan Forest]] so they could avoid the Orcs. Taking the forgotten road down [[Stonewain Valley]] the riders of Rohan were able to come to the [[Pelennor Fields]] undetected.
[[File:Abe Papakhian - The Ride of the Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abe Papakhian]] - ''The Ride of the Rohirrim'']]
To his dismay, they found Hirgon dead and understood that the Gondorians were unaware of their arrival; Minas Tirith [[Siege of Gondor|was being destroyed]]. Théoden was reinvigorated by a sudden great flash of light from the city. He ordered to charge as the [[Storm of Mordor|Darkness]] was fading. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In that battle he challenged a chieftain of the [[Haradrim]] who led their cavalry and had a standard with a ""black serpent upon scarlet"", and unhorsed him and hewed down his standard-bearer.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Eowyn against Witch-king'']]
The [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] attacked him, and he was mortally wounded when his horse [[Snowmane]] fell upon him after being frightened by the Ringwraith's [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]].

He was immediately avenged by Éowyn and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], both of whom had ridden to war in secret. He claimed to Merry at his death on the field that he was satisfied, for he had felled the Black Serpent.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The body of Théoden the Renowned remained in the [[Hallows]] of Minas Tirith<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> while [[Snowmane]] was buried where they fell.

His nephew Éomer succeeded him as King of Rohan. In [[July]] he returned to Minas Tirith and brought Théoden's body back to [[Edoras]]. On [[10 August]], the funeral of Théoden took place. [[Gléowine]] composed a poem for him and other Kings of the line of [[Eorl]].<ref name=""partings"">{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Théoden'' is derived from the [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:þeoden|þeoden]]'', which means ""chief of a people"", ""prince"" or ""king"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 368</ref> The word ''þeoden'' contains the element ''þeod'', which means ""people"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/31679|articlename=þeóden, n.|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> 

His epithet ''Ednew'' is derived from the Old English word ''edneowe'', which means ""renewed"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 705</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/8891|articlename=ed-neowe, adj.|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>

In Tolkien's fictional etymology, the name ''Théoden'' is an Old English translation of the original [[Rohanese]] ''Tûrac'', an old word for King.<ref name=""PM"">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, $54</ref>

'''Éomer ''Éadig''''' of the [[House of Eorl]] was the eighteenth [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]] and first of the Third Line. He was the son of [[Théodwyn]], sister of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Éomund]], a Chief Marshal of the [[Riddermark]]. After he and his sister [[Éowyn]] were orphaned, Théoden adopted them as his own children.<ref name=""Appendix A"">{{App|Mark}}</ref>   

==History==
===Youth===
[[File:Anna Lee - Young Éomer and Éowyn.jpg|thumb|left|Anna Lee - ''Young Éomer and Éowyn'']]
Éomer was born in {{TA|2991}} as son of [[Éomund]] and [[Théodwyn]]. When he was eleven years old, his father was slain by [[Orcs|Orc]] raiders in the [[Emyn Muil]]. His mother fell ill and died soon after. His uncle [[Théoden]] adopted him and his sister [[Éowyn]] as his own children and they went to live at [[Meduseld]].

Éomer grew strong and tall and became a valiant and skilled warrior and rider. Théoden made him [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] and he was in command of the [[East-mark]] like his father. He had his home at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]], one of the oldest towns of Rohan. With his [[Éored]] he defended Rohan mainly against Orcs from [[Mordor]].<ref name=""Appendix A"" />

===Struggle against Saruman===
[[File:John Howe - Eomer 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|""Éomer"" by [[John Howe]]]]
But Rohan's enemies were not only at the borders but also within. [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]], the King's advisor, was secretly a spy of the wizard [[Saruman]], who dwelled at [[Isengard]] and had become a servant of [[Sauron]]. Gríma, in secret, worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom and Théoden fell deeply under his influence. Éomer fell into the King's disfavor, but Gríma did not manage to destroy Éomer's loyalty to Théoden; nor to his cousin, Prince [[Théodred]], whom Éomer regarded as his brother.

In the summer of {{TA|3018|n}} [[Boromir]], son of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], crossed Rohan on his way to [[Rivendell]]. Éomer learned from him about the dream of [[Isildur's Bane]]. Soon after September, evil Men, Orcs and Wargs in Saruman's service began to fight openly against the Rohirrim. Saruman claimed lordship over Rohan and blocked the [[Gap of Rohan]].

The chief obstacles to an easy conquest of Rohan by Saruman were Théodred and Éomer. So came the first great battle in the conflict, the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], on [[25 February]] {{TA|3019|n}}. After untiring assaults on Théodred's position, the Prince was finally killed, leaving Éomer as the only obstacle. 

The [[26 February|day after]] the battle, Èomer gained knowledge of a troop of Orcs entering Rohan from [[Emyn Muil]] to the east. Unbeknownst to Éomer, they were the same Orcs that had taken [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] captive. Suspecting an alliance between Saruman and Sauron, he wanted to hunt them down. Under the strong influence of Gríma, Théoden forbade Éomer to pursue the Orcs because Edoras would be left unguarded. But Éomer neglected the order since he already suspected Gríma's treachery, and [[27 February|at around midnight]] he set out from [[Eastfold]] with his [[Éored]]. At the end of [[28 February|the next day]] they caught sight of the Orcs at the border of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=""Appendix B"">{{App|Great}}</ref> They surrounded them and remained watchful throughout the night. With several small attacks they weakened the troop until another Orc band from Isengard arrived. The Rohirrim defeated them and surrounded the first troop even closer.

With the first light of the new day the Rohirrim proceeded to attack. They killed all the Orcs and Éomer himself slew their leader [[Uglúk]]. The [[hobbits]] meanwhile were able to flee into Fangorn Forest. 
Fifteen men and 12 horses did not survive the assault. They were buried in a mound encircled with fifteen spears.<ref name=""Uruk-hai"">{{TT|Uruk}}</ref>
[[File:Cor Blok - Meeting of Éomer with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.jpg|thumb|250px|right|""Meeting of Éomer with [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]]"" by [[Cor Blok]]]]
On the way back to Edoras, the Rohirrim met [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]]. Éomer demanded their names and business. Fighting almost broke almost out between them, but Aragorn prevented this. He then told Éomer his true name and showed him his sword, [[Andúril]]. Éomer now listened to the story of their journey, and learned about the losses of [[Gandalf]] and [[Boromir]]. When Aragorn revealed that they had tracked the band of Orcs all the way from the [[Emyn Muil]] in the hope of rescuing the hobbits, Éomer was astonished and gave Aragorn the name ""Wingfoot"", recognizing the difficulty of crossing so much terrain in so little time. He revealed that his men had destroyed the band of Orcs, and that it was fruitless to go searching for his friends. He instead urged Aragorn to return with him to Edoras to help the people of Rohan in their need, but Aragorn refused and insisted that he be able to continue his search for the hobbits. Although he was counteracting the law of Rohan by letting Aragorn go free, Éomer decided to trust him and he even lent him and his companions two horses, [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]], to help them in their search, but he asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Edoras when their search was over.<ref name=""Riders"">{{TT|Riders}}</ref>

Upon his return to Edoras, Éomer threatened Gríma, but Gríma arrested him and accused him of breaking the law because he had pursued the Orcs and had allowed strangers to roam freely without Théoden's permission. 
[[File:John Howe - Helm's Deep.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[John Howe]] - ''Helms Deep'']]
Éomer was released after Gandalf healed Théoden from the influence of Gríma. He was delighted to see that his king was recovering quickly from his weakness. Now Gríma's treachery was revealed, but due to Gandalf's intervening he was not killed, but rather expelled from the [[Meduseld|Golden Hall]]. Théoden, now realizing the situation, decided to lead the Rohirrim into battle against Saruman instantly. The [[Three Hunters]] and Gandalf accompanied them when they left Edoras the same day.<ref name=""King"">{{TT|King}}</ref>

The following day they met the scout [[Ceorl]] who had been sent out by [[Erkenbrand]] to warn Éomer. He was surprised to come across King Théoden's army riding north and brought news that Saruman had let loose his forces and that the Rohirrim had been forced to retreat across the Isen with great losses. These tidings caused Théoden to reconsider his strategy. After consulting with Gandalf he decided to ride to join Erkenbrand at [[Helm's Deep]] while the wizard left them, saying that he would meet them there.

They arrived at Helm's Deep on the night of [[3 March]] and Éomer oversaw the preparations for the great battle. In the middle of the night, the siege began, and when battering rams attacked the gates, Éomer and Aragorn led a sortie through a passage on the side of the Hornburg that drove the enemies threatening the doors away. In the course of this Gimli saved Éomer's life when he killed two Orcs who had ambushed Éomer. The battle continued throughout the night and ever more attackers scaled the walls with large ladders. Aragorn and Éomer had to repeatedly move the defenders, who were getting weary, to repel the Orcs. With the help of a device of Saruman's the Orcs caused an explosion under the wall that made a wide hole in it. From then on the attackers could not be stopped and the defenders were separated. Éomer and Gimli retreated to the [[Glittering Caves]] whereas Aragorn and Legolas defended the Hornburg.

The battle seemed lost when at dawn Gandalf returned with Erkenbrand and 1000 riders from the Westfold. Together they drove the enemies out of the deep and into a forest of [[Huorns]] that had arrived during the night and from which no Orcs returned.<ref name=""Deep"">{{TT|Deep}}</ref>
After the end of the battle Éomer accompanied his king to Isengard.<ref name=""Road"">{{HM|TT}}, ""[[The Road to Isengard]]""</ref> There they met Saruman who tried to enthral Théoden with his magic voice, but both Éomer and Théoden saw through him and his dark designs. Théoden said that Rohan would have no peace until Saruman and his works had perished. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order of [[Wizards]] and the [[White Council]].<ref name=""Voice"">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>

===The Battle of the Pelennor Fields===
On [[5 March]] the company set out to Helm's Deep. While they rested in the night Pippin took the ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' [[Orthanc-stone|of Orthanc]] from the sleeping Gandalf, looked in it, and was confronted by Sauron. Knowing the peril Pippin was in, Gandalf said farewell to the others and departed with Pippin towards [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=""Palantir"">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> The Three Hunters and the Rohirrim continued their journey towards Helm's Deep where they arrived on [[6 March]]. Now Aragorn looked into the palantír and revealed himself to Sauron. Because of what he glimpsed in the ''palantír'', he left the Rohirrim, and took the [[Paths of the Dead]] with the [[Grey Company]]. Éomer was afraid of never seeing him again, but Aragorn predicted that they would ""meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor should stand between."" before setting out.<ref name=""Passing"">{{RK|Company}}</ref>

Éomer accompanied his king to the muster of [[Dunharrow]] where he met his sister Éowyn again. Then the [[Red Arrow]] of [[Gondor]], which requested Rohan's aid, was brought by a messenger and the Rohhirim set out in great haste to Minas Tirith.<ref name=""Muster"">{{RK|Muster}}</ref> They used narrow mountain paths and on [[13 March]] reached Drúadan Forest where they met [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], the chief of the Drúedain. He agreed to lead the Rohirrim by a secret road past the Orc hosts that laid siege to Minas Tirith.
[[File:Per Sjögren - The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.jpg|thumb|Per Sjögren - ''The Battle of the Pelennor Fields'']]
The Rohirrim arrived on the battleground of the [[Pelennor Fields]] at dawn on [[15 March]]. Éomer led the first Éored that should follow the king's banner in the centre.<ref name=""Ride"">{{RK|Ride}}</ref> The Rohirrim were strong and filled with wrath and many enemies were slain. The Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will and so Éomer was only brought to Théoden when the king was already mortally wounded. Before his death Théoden hailed Éomer as King of the Mark and Éomer and those who stood by wept. When Éomer recognized Éowyn lying nearby, a cold fury rose in him and without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the City he led his men across the field, slaying all enemies in their path. As they charged he shouted out ""Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!"".

But soon fortune turned against Éomer and he and his men were encircled. Just in time came the aid of the horsemen of Gondor, among them [[Hirluin|Hirluin of the Green Hills]] and [[Imrahil]] prince of [[Dol Amroth]]. But ever more enemies came from [[Osgiliath]], and when the black ships of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] came up the [[Anduin]], the battle seemed lost. Éomer rallied the Rohirrim for a last fight against the Corsairs when he realized the standard of Aragorn unfurling on the first ship. 
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Eomer and Aragorn (colour).jpg|left|thumb|Abe Papakhian - ''Éomer and Aragorn'']]
The enemies fled when they saw that their own ships were filled with foes and so Éomer met Aragorn in the midst of the battlefield as Aragorn had predicted.<ref name=""Pelennor"">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

The battle ended in victory and Éomer learned that Éowyn was not dead, but lay gravely ill in the [[Houses of Healing]]. He also learned that the contact with the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] was not the only reason for her sickness but that also her despair had worsened it. Aragorn managed to heal Éowyn and she awoke at her brother's call. Meriadoc Brandybuck was also healed and Éomer made him a Knight of the Riddermark in return for his aid for Éowyn and Théoden.<ref name=""Healing"">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

The next day, Éomer took part in the debate of the Captains of the West. There Gandalf told that their hope now lay with [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]], who had gone to [[Mordor]] to destroy [[the One Ring]] wrought by Sauron. Gandalf counselled that they should ride to the [[Black Gate]] in order to force Sauron to empty his land and take the Dark Lord's attention away from his search for the Ring, giving the Ring-bearers their only chance. Aragorn agreed and Éomer followed his friend in return for his aid in their time of need.<ref name=""Debate"">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

On [[18 March]] the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]], Gandalf, the Three Hunters, and Éomer among them, set out towards the Black Gate. They [[Battle of the Morannon|fought]] there on [[25 March]] and withstood the forces of the enemy until the Ring was destroyed and Sauron and his servants and works perished.<ref name=""Gate"">{{RK|Gate}}</ref>

===King of the Mark===
After the great victory, Aragorn set up his camp on the [[Field of Cormallen]] in [[North Ithilien]] and Éomer took part in the celebrations there.<ref name=""Cormallen"">{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> 
Together with the other Captains of the West he returned to Minas Tirith and attended the coronation of Aragorn on [[1 May]]. A week later he renewed the [[Oath of Eorl]] for Aragorn and both swore everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor.<ref name=""Steward"">{{RK|Steward}}</ref> On [[8 May]] he, with his sister, set out to Rohan, for there was much to organize and to set in order.<ref name=""chief"">{{app|Chief}}</ref> 

Éomer returned to Minas Tirith on [[18 July]] and set out the [[19 July|next day]], bringing Théoden's body back to Edoras. On [[10 August]] the funeral of Théoden took place<ref name=""chief"" /> and Éomer announced the betrothal of Éowyn to [[Faramir]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] and [[Prince of Ithilien]]. When the feast was over, Éomer and Éowyn gave Merry the name [[Holdwine]], ""loyal friend,"" of the Mark, and the ancient [[Horn of the Mark]], an heirloom of the [[House of Eorl]].<ref name=""Partings"" />

King Éomer discarded the old offices of [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second]] and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshals of Rohan]] and instead created the positions of [[Marshal of the West-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Erkenbrand]]) and [[Marshal of the East-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Elfhelm]]).<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 470</ref>

[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Sons of Rohan.jpg|thumb|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''Sons of Rohan'']]
But though Sauron had perished, the [[King of the West]] had many enemies to destroy before the [[White Tree]] could grow in peace. So Éomer often fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and went with King Elessar far into the [[East]] and [[South (disambiguation)|South]] of [[Middle-earth]]. He was known as '''Éomer Éadig''', or ""the Blessed"", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again. In {{TA|3021}} he wedded Princess [[Lothíriel]], daughter of Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]], whom he had met during his stay in Gondor, and she bore him a son [[Elfwine]] the Fair.<ref name=""Appendix A"" /><ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line''</ref>

He kept his friendship with his knight Merry Brandybuck and when he became [[Master of Buckland]] in {{FoA|11}}, the King sent him great gifts, as did his sister from [[Ithilien]].<ref name=""later"">{{App|Later}}</ref>

In {{FoA|63}} Éomer, presumably feeling death coming near him, asked Master [[Holdwine]] to visit him one last time. Both Merry and his friend Pippin came to Rohan and stayed with him until the autumn of that year, when King Éomer died.<ref name=""later"" />

King Éomer had reigned for 65 years, longer than any other King of Rohan save [[Aldor the Old]]. His son Elfwine the Fair became King of Rohan.

==Personality==
He was tall, strong, and possessed of great passion and also was considered a valiant and splendid warrior and a discerning and decent man. Éomer was ""of like height with [[Aragorn]]"" (which was probably 6&nbsp;ft, 6in.<ref name=""RC229"">{{HM|RC}}, page 229</ref>), due to his grandmother [[Morwen Steelsheen]], who was of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent.<ref name=""RC367"">{{HM|RC}}, page 367</ref>

==Weapon==
Éomer's sword was called [[Gúthwinë]],<ref name=""Deep"" /> which is [[Old English]] for ""battle-friend"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 85</ref>

==Etymology==
His name is likely derived from the Anglo-Saxon words ''eoh'' (""war-horse""), and ''mǣre'', (""grand, excellent, famous"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 367</ref> Éo- sounds like ""eh-ah"" with the ""ah"" just barely pronounced.<ref>{{App|E1iv}}, p. 1117</ref>

He adopted the epithet ''Éadig'' during his kingship, which is an [[Old English]] word meaning ""happy, wealthy"" and usually translated as ""blessed"", used for saints in medieval literature.<ref>http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/old_to_new_english_e.htm</ref>

==Inspiration==
''Eomer'' is an [[Old English]] name appearing in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''. Eomer is also an ancestor of [[Wikipedia:Offa of Mercia|Offa of Mercia]].<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Éomer and his army are shown slaying [[Uglúk]]'s band of Orcs, and later arriving at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] alongside [[Gandalf]] to help turn the tide (Éomer taking the place of [[Erkenbrand]], in that regard).

:Éomer is first met in the town of Eaworth in the [[Entwash]] Vale. Obligated to bring the player and their companions before the King, he takes them with his [[Éored]] to [[Edoras]].

'''Éowyn''' was a member of the [[House of Eorl]] and the niece of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]]. She was renowned for slaying the [[Witch-king of Angmar]]. She was the daughter of [[Théodwyn]], Théoden's sister, and [[Éomund]] of [[Eastfold]]; her brother was [[Éomer]]. Following the end of the [[War of the Ring]], she and [[Faramir]] were married, and she bore one son, [[Elboron]].<ref name=""Mark"">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

She was also known as the Lady of Rohan, Lady of the Shield-arm, the White Lady of Rohan,<ref group=""note"">Éowyn was known as ""Lady of Rohan"" in Rohan, but as ""White Lady of Rohan"" in Ithilien (due to her pale complexion).</ref> and Lady of [[Ithilien]].

==History==
{{Quote|What do you fear, lady?""<br>""A cage. To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.|[[Aragorn]] and Éowyn, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', ""[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]""}}

Following the death of her parents in {{TA|3002}}, Éowyn and Éomer were brought into Théoden's house and raised there. Éowyn grew to be tall and slender, with a grace and pride that came from her mother.<ref name=""Mark""/>

Prior to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Éowyn was left to care for [[Meduseld]] when Théoden and Éomer led the remaining [[Rohirrim]] to the west. King Théoden named her ruler of Rohan in his and Éomer's absence when [[Háma]] recommended that one of ""The House of Eorl"" should rule. At first, Théoden only thought of the men of his house, of which he and Éomer were the last, but Háma reminded the King of Éowyn, who ""is fearless,"" and that ""all love her.""<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

Éowyn revealed her temperament when [[Aragorn]] was to ride into the mountains and take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Unable to dissuade him, she desired to accompany him, declaring herself ""weary of skulking in the hills,"" with a ""wish to face peril and battle."" However, Aragorn reminded her of her charge to govern the people until the king's return and left without her.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

[[File:Matt Stewart - Dernhelm.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[:Category:Images by Matt Stewart|Matt Stewart]] - ''Dernhelm'']]
Later, when the forces of Rohan were mustered to go to Gondor, Éowyn disguised herself as a man, and under the alias of '''[[Dernhelm]]''', travelled with the Riders of Rohan, carrying with her [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who was also ordered to remain behind.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], she fought by King Théoden, and when he was struck down by the Witch-king of Angmar, she took it upon herself to defend the King of Rohan. Confronting the Witch-king, who boasted that ""no living man may hinder me"", she removed her helmet, revealing her long golden hair and declaring:

<blockquote>''""No living man am I! You look upon a woman.""''</blockquote>

Though he was filled with doubt at her unveiling, the Witch-king fought her, and broke her shield and arm with his mace. Yet before he could strike her down, Merry, who had not been heeded by the Witch-king, struck him behind the knee with a [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]], crippling the wraith, and giving Éowyn the chance to thrust her sword between the crown and mantle, which shattered the blade. Thus Éowyn slew the Witch-king with Merry's aid, and fell upon her fallen foe, seemingly dead.<ref name=""Battle"">{{RK|V6}}</ref>

She was granted the title ""Lady of the Shield-arm"" after the battle in recognition of her triumph, as her shield-arm had been broken in the fight.<ref name=""Battle"">{{RK|V6}}</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Éomer found Éowyn beside Théoden, and, believing that both his sister and the King were dead, was filled with grief and fury. Taking the kingship of Rohan, he ordered that Théoden and Éowyn be taken to the Citadel. Éowyn was borne away alongside Théoden in honour, as she had fallen into a death-like sleep from the [[Black Breath]], and was presumed dead. However, [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]] recognised then that she yet lived, and instead ordered that she be taken to the [[Houses of Healing]], where she would receive help.<ref name=""Battle"">{{RK|V6}}</ref>
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Healing of Eowyn.jpg|thumb|200px|left|""The Healing of Éowyn"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
Éowyn was severely injured, and because of the Black Breath of the Nazgûl, she faced certain death; however, she was treated soon after by Aragorn during his brief sojourn into [[Minas Tirith]]. After a while she awakened, and since she had not yet recovered fully, she was not permitted to join the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]] that would march on [[Mordor]]. However, whilst recovering in the Houses of Healing, she met Faramir, with whom she later fell in love.<ref name=""Steward""/>
[[File:Magdalena Olechny - Eowyn and Faramir.jpg|thumb|200px|''Eowyn and Faramir'' by [[:Category:Images by Magdalena Olechny|Magdalena Olechny]]]]
After the defeat of [[Sauron]] and the celebrations, on [[8 May]] she followed her brother, now King of Rohan, back home to [[Edoras]].<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

Later, Éowyn settled in [[Ithilien]], of which Faramir was made the ruling Prince. She was thereafter known as the ''Lady of Ithilien''.<ref name=""Steward""/><ref group=note>This seems to imply that Éowyn was not a Princess, whereas her husband was a Prince.</ref> Éowyn and Faramir were married, and dwelt together in the hills of [[Emyn Arnen]] in Ithilien.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> She kept her friendship with Merry, and when he became [[Master of Buckland]] in {{FoA|11}}, she sent him great gifts, as did her brother from Rohan.<ref>{{App|Later}}, entry for the year S.R. 1432 (= F.A. 11)</ref>

They had at least one son (likely [[Elboron]]),<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> and their grandson was [[Barahir (grandson of Faramir)|Barahir]], who wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'' in the Fourth Age.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Éowyn'' means ""Horse-joy"" or ""lover of horses"" in [[Old English]] (being a combination of her parents' names: [[Éomund]] and [[Théodwyn]]),<ref name=""Intro"">{{HM|IE}}, ""The Giving of Names"", p. 216</ref> the language [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] adapted to represent [[Rohanese]].<ref name=""L144"">{{L|144}}</ref>

Éo- sounds like ""eh-ah"" with the ""ah"" just barely pronounced, while ''y'' is the modified ''u'',<ref name=""Umlaut""/> which is more or less as ''u'' in French ''lune''.<ref>{{App|Vowels}}, p. 1115</ref>

==Other names==
The ""White Lady of Rohan"" title was given by Faramir to Éowyn of Rohan when they were together looking out from the walls of Minas Tirith and saw the huge cloud that rose above Mordor at the fall of Sauron<ref name=""Steward"">{{RK|VI5}}</ref> on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an early rough note, Éowyn was originally known as ""''Eowyn Elfsheen daughter of Theoden''"".<ref>{{TI|Riders}}, p. 390</ref> In the first drafts of her appearance, she was split into two characters: Éowyn, sister of Éomer, and [[Idis]], daughter of Théoden. Tolkien eventually discarded Idis as Éowyn overshadowed her, and planned to have Éowyn wed Aragorn when he became the King of Gondor. However, Tolkien cut out the love story, deciding to make Éowyn ""''the twin-sister of Eomund, a stern amazon woman''"", and possibly dying to save or avenge Théoden.<ref name=King>{{TI|King}}, pp. 447-448</ref>

== Analysis ==
Just as MacDuff disconcerted [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Macbeth Macbeth] by revealing he was not ""of woman born"", Lady Éowyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old prophecy by [[Glorfindel]], fulfilling that the Witch-king would not be slain by a man. However, the Witch-king actually recited the prophecy incorrectly: he said that ""no living man may hinder me,"" though the prophecy actually said that ""not by the hand of ''man'' will he fall.""<ref name=""Gondor"">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Glorfindel's prophecy, unlike his own version, implies that the Witch-king will not fall to a man. In Tolkien's writing, man and woman applies simply to the gender of any Middle-earth race. Only when he capitalised Man did it denote the race of Men. The Witch-king may not have realised that the prophecy meant only a male, thus, his moment of doubt and hesitation when he faced Éowyn.<ref name=""Battle""/>

'''1955-6: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Olive Gregg]] provides the voice of Éowyn.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Éowyn is briefly seen, but has no lines.

'''1979: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Mind's Eye's The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:Éowyn is portrayed by [[Karen Hurley]].

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Éowyn is voiced by actress [[Nellie Bellflower]]. She appears unintroduced, but Merry fills Pippin (and so the spectator) in on the details. She is not terribly wounded, and appears healthy beside Faramir at the coronation.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Elin Jenkins]] plays the part of Éowyn. She is introduced much earlier than in the book when [[Gandalf]] escapes from Isengard and borrows a horse from Théoden. Unlike some adaptations her recovery in the Houses of Healing, and the blossoming of her relationship with Faramir are included. She is last encountered in the penultimate episode gifting Merry the horn he would blow later during the scouring of the Shire.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Éowyn is played by Donata Höffer.

'''2002-3: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Éowyn is portrayed by [[Miranda Otto]]. Jackson's adaptation shows two different explanations for Éowyn's injuries after fighting the Witch-king. In the Theatrical Release, her wounds are less severe than in the book; she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. In the Extended Edition, she is near death; her brother finds her and grieves, and later she is healed in the Houses of Healing, where she meets Faramir.

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Éowyn is provided by Diana Mórová. Éowyn is alluded to in ''The Two Towers'', but has no lines. She appears fully in ''The Return of the King''. Her role is identical to that in the books.

'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Éowyn is first encountered in Edoras, shortly before the arrival of Gandalf and the Three Hunters. After King Théoden departs with his host, the player stays behind and helps Éowyn with various preparations before moving the citizens to [[Dunharrow]]. As Dernhelm, she travels to Minas Tirith with permission of [[Elfhelm]], who keeps her secret and gives her the sword of her late cousin [[Théodred]], taken from the [[Fords of Isen]]. It is the very sword that Eowyn uses to slay the [[Witch-King]] of [[Angmar]], though it breaks in doing the deed. After healing from her wounds, she attends the coronation of King Elessar, but departs for Edoras prior to Aragorn and Arwen's wedding.

'''Círdan''' was one of the highest and most noble of the [[Sindar]],<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> lord of the [[Falas]] during the [[First Age]], and Master of the [[Grey Havens]] through the [[Second Age|Second]], [[Third Age|Third]], and [[Fourth Age]]. 

He was one of the wisest and most foresighted of the [[Elves]], and by the [[Second Age]], one of the oldest named [[Elves]] in [[Middle-earth]] to remain so throughout that age and into the [[Fourth Age]] as well.

He was also gifted [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]], by [[Celebrimbor]] until he surrendered it to [[Gandalf]]. As the Lord of the Havens, he oversaw the departure of the Elves of Middle-earth to the West and eventually sought the [[Last Ship]] with his kinsman [[Celeborn]].{{fact}}

==History==
===First Age===
====Early life====
Círdan, born '''Nōwē''',<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> was kin of both [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]], the kings of the [[Teleri]].<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> Of shipbuilding, whether by their first homes at [[Cuiviénen]] or when the [[Teleri]] dwelt by the [[Sea of Rhûn]], Nōwē was always the foremost and most skilled in the craft.<ref name=""LastWritingsN"" /> During the push westward, seeking to go to [[Valinor]], Nōwē and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.{{fact}}

Despite Nōwē's great eagerness to see the [[light of Valinor]] (his ""greatest desire""),<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> he loyally searched for [[Elwë]] upon his disappearance. Because of this, the [[Teleri]] missed the first trip on [[Tol Eressëa]] to [[Valinor]], on which went their kin, the [[Noldor]] and the [[Vanyar]]. They took for their king [[Olwë]], and while waiting for [[Ulmo]] to return for them, Nōwē headed the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession he took the name ""'''Círdan'''"" which means ""shipwright"" in [[Sindarin]]. The [[Teleri]] also developed a great friendship with [[Ossë]]. At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, Círdan sought [[Elwë]] longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.<ref name=""Cirdan"" />

Because of this, Círdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eressëa.<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eressëa as it vanished into the West over [[Belegaer]]. But into his heart came a message from the [[Valar]] which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work would be of utmost worth, remembered in song. Círdan answered in obeyance, and saw a vision of [[Vingilot|a ship]].<ref name=""Cirdan"" />

====Lord of the Falas====
=====Foundation=====
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Cirdan, Lord of the Falathrim.jpg|225px|thumb|left|''Cirdan, Lord of the Falathrim'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Círdan therefore remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Ossë, and became their lord. The folk became known as the [[Falathrim]], ""''people of the foaming shore''"", and dwelt in the [[Falas]] by the sea. There they built many ships, and the mighty [[Havens of the Falas]], and found pearls which they sent to their king, [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], who was known as Elwë.<ref name=""Sindar"">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

When [[Morgoth]] broke forth in the [[First Battle]] in {{YT|1497}}, Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol's aid. Further, although Thingol prevailed with the help of the [[Laiquendi]], the Green-elves of [[Ossiriand]], the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the [[Return of the Noldor]] from Aman, when [[Fëanor]] struck at [[Morgoth]] from the north. The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the [[Orcs]] were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by [[Celegorm]] and his forces, and the Falas was saved.<ref name=""Sindar"" /><ref name=""return"">{{S|Return}}</ref>

=====Wars of the Noldor=====
Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor.<ref name=""return"" /> Between Círdan and [[Finrod Felagund]], [[King of Nargothrond]], there was friendship and alliance, and with the aid of the [[Noldor]] the havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were built anew.<ref name=""Belerian"">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

When the tales began spreading (sown by [[Morgoth]]) of the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]], Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice. Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers. Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard. This resulted in Thingol banning the speaking of [[Quenya]] and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>

Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the [[Wars of Beleriand|wars of the Noldor]] with his role in the [[Second Assault on Hithlum]], coming to the timely aid of [[Fingon]] when he was most needed. The ships of Círdan sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]] in great stength and then struck the unsuspecting [[Orcs]] from the west, giving victory to the Elves.<ref name=""Fingolfin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Many years later, in {{FA|472}}, after the disastrous [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], many fugitives came for shelter in Círdan's havens. The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea. But it was only a matter of time before [[Morgoth]] attacked. Then came the disastrous [[Fall of the Falas]]. Though both [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Morgoth had in his train. Although Círdan's people fought valiantly, the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved. [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste. But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him the young [[Gil-galad]], one of the last of the princes of the Noldor. They came to the [[Isle of Balar]] and founded a new refuge, but kept a foothold at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], keeping ships hidden in the reeds there.<ref name=""Fifth"">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

====Refuge in Balar====
[[Turgon]], the King of [[Gondolin]], receiving the dreadful news, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek [[Valinor]] and the aid of the [[Valar]]. Círdan built seven swift ships, and sent them westward. None returned, save for only [[Voronwë|one mariner]] of the [[Gondolindrim]] who was also his kinsman.<ref name=""Tuor"">{{UT|1}}</ref> The way to the West was closed.<ref name=""Fifth"" />

Eventually Círdan served as messenger, when [[Ulmo]] delivered him a message for [[Orodreth]], the King of [[Nargothrond]], warning of the doom of Nargothrond, and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge. The warning went unheeded, resulting in the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495}}.{{fact}}

After news came to Balar of the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Gil-galad]] was proclaimed [[High King of the Noldor]]. Círdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf [[Eärendil]] son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him. Círdan aided Eärendil in building the ship [[Vingilot]], giving him advice and help. Círdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.<ref name=""Cirdan"" />

Círdan and Gil-galad came with their ships from Balar too late to prevent the disastrous [[Third Kinslaying]], when the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] were ambushed and many fell. But Eärendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the [[Silmaril]] of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] had been spirited away by [[Elwing]] his wife. Thus, wielding the Silmaril, Eärendil came to [[Valinor]] and found the forgiveness of the [[Valar]].<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Elves,<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of [[Glorfindel]], who also contributed significantly).{{fact}}

After the [[War of Wrath]], Círdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart's desire and going West, but with a small following remained in [[Middle-earth]].

===Second Age===
The continents were shifted, but Círdan still took up his abode by the sea, at the [[Grey Havens]], which the Elves built in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]] whence the [[Eldar]] could sail the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there.<ref name=""rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

At the very beginning of the [[Second Age]], Círdan was instrumental in devising and overseeing the construction of the boats that were used to transport the remnants of the [[Edain]] to their new land, which would later become the realm of [[Númenor]].<ref name=""Edain"">{{NM|P3xiii}}, p. 339</ref>

Círdan personally elected the Elven captains and helmsmen who were in charge of transporting the Edain to Númenor, and since those boats were small, it took a great number of such boats to transfer all of the Edain and their possessions - a process that took at least 50 years, and which only ended when the Valar instructed Círdan to cease any future migration of Men to the island.<ref name=""Edain"" />

Many centuries later, in {{SA|600}}, Círdan welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen [[Númenóreans]], making friends with [[Vëantur]], chief of the mariners of [[Tar-Elendil]], and later teaching [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] his grandson of ships (both management and construction) and seaside architecture,<ref name=""Wife"">{{UT|Wife}}</ref> doubtless being the foremost authority on both.{{fact}}

Círdan advised against the creation of the [[Rings of Power]] when [[Sauron|Annatar]] came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the ambition of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]. Nevertheless, when the [[Three Rings]]  were hidden, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them and so, Círdan received [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire.<ref name=""rings"" /> [[Sauron]], having revealed himself in the [[Sack of Eregion|destruction of Eregion]] and empowered by [[the One Ring]] he had forged, [[sack of Eregion|invaded]] [[Eriador]] in the same blow; however, he dared not attempt to take Círdan's [[Mithlond]] or [[Lindon]], fearing they were too strong because they had the help of the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=""rings"" />

Círdan joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and fought alongside [[Gil-galad]]. Many fell there, including [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]]. After the battle, with Elrond, he urged [[Isildur]], Elendil's heir, to throw the captured One Ring into [[Orodruin]], where it would be unmade, but Isildur refused.<ref name=""rings"" /><ref name=""Council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

===Third Age===
{{blockquote|Take this ring, Master… for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself. For this is the Ring of Fire, and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill. But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the [[Last Ship|last ship]] sails. I will await you.| Círdan to Gandalf, ''[[Appendix B]]''}}

[[File:Alystraea - Cirdan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Cirdan'' by [[:Category:Images by Alystraea|Alystraea]]]]
After the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the death of Gil-galad, Círdan remained the Lord of the Havens.<ref name=""rings"" /> For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed,<ref name=""AppB2"">{{App|B2}}</ref> but at around {{TA|1050}}, a shadow began to lengthen. It was at this time the [[Istari]], sent by the [[Valar]], came. Círdan was the most foresighted of all Elves in Middle-earth, and he alone knew the true purpose of the Istari.<ref name=""AppB2"" /> He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him [[Narya]], his greatest possession and one of the most secret and sought-after treasures in the world.<ref name=""rings"" />

Throughout the [[Angmar War]], the Elves of Lindon under Círdan supported [[Arnor]]. They assisted King [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]] and the men of [[Cardolan]] drive off the [[Hill-men]] from the [[Weather Hills]]. Later, with Círdan’s help, Arveleg's young son, [[Araphor]], drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.<ref name=""eriador"">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

In {{TA|1975}}, Círdan sent Elven sailors from Lindon on a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue the lost king [[Arvedui]]. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The next year, Círdan and the Elves of Lindon [[Host of the West (Arnor)|joined]] with the remnants of [[Arnor]] in the victorious [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref name=""eriador"" /><ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Later, Círdan took control of the abandoned [[palantíri|Elendil Stone]] on [[Emyn Beraid]], which could gaze into the [[Tol Eressëa|lost west]] and was without link to the other ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name=""Palantiri"">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>
[[File:Peter Pracownik - Ten of Cups (LOTR).jpg|thumb|135px|right|Círdan remains in Middle-earth - Art by [[Peter Pracownik]]]]
Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the [[War of the Ring]] in {{TA|3018}} and later in {{TA|3021|n}}. [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was his messenger to [[Rivendell]] and attended the [[Council of Elrond]], speaking with authority on his lord's behalf.<ref name=""Council"" />

The last mention of Círdan came with the end of the Third Age. When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, Círdan greeted them before the gates. Although [[Gandalf]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]] passed west on the [[White Ship|ship]] he had built for them, Círdan seems to have remained for a time.{{fact}}

===Later history===
{{Main|Last Ship}}
Círdan maintained the haven at least into the early [[Fourth Age]], but it was recognized that eventually, its purpose would reach an end when no more Eldar wished to cross the [[Sea]]. At that time, Círdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the [[Straight Road]] himself.<ref name=""eriador"" /> On some unknown date, he sailed west aboard the [[Last Ship]] with his kinsman [[Celeborn]], but when he did so, he took with him the last living memory of the [[Elder Days]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""prologue"" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Cirdan.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Círdan'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means ""Shipbuilder""<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 27</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries '''KIR-''' and '''TAN-'''</ref> or ""Shipwright"".<ref>{{PM|Last}}, ""Círdan"", p. 385</ref>

The [[Quenya]] cognate was '''''Ciryatan''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈkirʲatan]}}).<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ""kir-''<nowiki/>''</ref>

==Other names==
Círdan's original name was '''''Nōwē'''''. According to [[Paul Strack]], it was a [[Primitive Elvish]] name, but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2331717483.html|articlename=✶ ''Nōwē'' pn.|website=Eldamo|accessed=10 October 2023}}</ref>

He was also called '''''Cirdan the Shipwright''''',<ref name=""Aman"">{{AA|70}}, p. 85</ref> as well as '''''Cirdan of Lune'''''<ref name=""Lune"" /><ref name=""Moon"" /> (in both instances, without accent over the letter ''i'', though).

==Appearance==
In the last years of the Third Age, Círdan appeared old save for his eyes which ""''were keen as stars''""; he also had a long beard.<ref name=""Havens"">{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1030</ref> Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his [[Elven life cycle#""Cycles of life"" and aging|third cycle of life]].<ref>{{VT|41b}}, p. 9</ref>

==Significance==
[[File:David Greset - Cirdan the Carpenter.jpg|130px|thumb|left|''Cirdan the Carpenter'' by [[:Category:Images by David Greset|David Greset]]]]
Círdan had a profound effect upon the course of Middle-earth history. He was a loyal servant and friend of [[Elwë]], sacrificing his heart's desire in search of him.<ref name=""Cirdan"" />

This loyalty and sense of duty shows up numerous times over the course of history, including his second sacrifice in his submission to the [[Valar]],<ref name=""Cirdan"" /> and his sending of troubling and potentially destructive rumors to his overlord Thingol.

He was also the most foresighted of the Elves, a consequence of the gift from the Valar.<ref name=""Cirdan"" /><ref name=""AppB2"" /> He conceivably saved Elven civilization with the founding of the havens at the [[Mouths of Sirion]],<ref name=""Fifth"" /> and with the fostering of both [[Gil-galad]] and [[Eärendil]].<ref name=""Earendil"" /> His precious gift of [[Narya]] to [[Gandalf]] was also timely and valuable.<ref name=""AppB2"" /> He was clearly favored by [[Ulmo]], seen by the number of messages passed through him.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===''The Lord of the Rings'' drafts===
The character of Círdan is a fairly late addition to [[Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], with his first appearance in the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (dating to the early [[1940]]s) being in an outline of what would become the eleventh chapter, ''[[The Palantír]]'', of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.<ref name=""Wright"">{{WR|1|VI}}, pp. 76-7</ref>

The name ''Círdan'' in this outline was spelled as ''Cirdan'', and in one other instance as ''Kirdan''.<ref name=""Wright"" />

Nonetheless, in a draft for the chapter ''[[Many Partings]]'', the term ''Círdan'' is used.<ref>{{SD|Partings}}, p. 67</ref>

===''The Etymologies''===
However, Círdan's first appearance in the legendarium as a whole seems to be in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' (dating from the late [[1930]]s), where his name was instead given as ''C(e)irdan'' (""shipbuilder"" in [[Noldorin]]), with the ''(e)'' probably indicating a development from the Noldorin word ''[[ceir]]'' (""ship""). The name ''Ceirdan'' was itself changed from an earlier form ''Certhan''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''TAN-''', p. 390</ref>

===Later legendarium===
In a late text called ''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'' (c. [[1969]]), there appears a passage in which Tolkien briefly considered Círdan as being one of the Noldor,<ref name=""Weird"">{{NM|P3xxii}}, pp. 387-8</ref> in a text explaining the origin of the name ''[[Belfalas]]'':

{{blockquote|There appears, however, in the beginning of the Second Age, to have been a group of Sindar who went south. They were a remnant, it seems, of the people of Doriath, who harboured still their grudge against the Noldor and left the Grey Havens because these and all the ships there were commanded by '''Círdan (a Noldo)'''.|''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'', ''""Belfalas""'' <ref name=Weird/>}}

However, [[Carl Hostetter]] later comments, quoting [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s own commentary on the text:

{{blockquote|The manuscript page ends mid-sentence, and without reaching an explanation of the element ''Bel-''. Christopher Tolkien writes: ""It was perhaps a purely experimental extension of the history, at once abandoned; but the assertion that Círdan was a Noldo is very strange. This runs clean counter to the entire tradition concerning him — yet it is essential to the idea sketched in this passage. Possibly it was his realization of this that led my father to abandon it in mid-sentence.""|''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'', ""Commentary on the text ''Belfalas''"" <ref name=Weird/>}}

At no other point in the legendarium was Círdan ever considered a Noldo.

'''Daeron''' was a [[Sindar]]in [[Elves|Elf]] who dwelt in [[Doriath]] as the chief [[loremaster]] and [[Minstrels|minstrel]] of King [[Thingol]] during the [[First Age]].

He is known primarily for his role in [[Of Beren and Lúthien|the tale of Beren and Lúthien]] where, out of his own unrequited love for Thingol's daughter [[Lúthien]], he twice betrayed her to Thingol. After Lúthien escaped and fled Doriath, Daeron became lost in the search for her, and eventually wandered east over the [[Blue Mountains]].

His role is primarily told within ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', which itself is referred to within ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' where Daeron's history is much more briefly given.

[[File:Pete Amachree - Daeron at the court of Menegroth.jpg|thumb|right|''Daeron at the court of Menegroth'' by [[Pete Amachree]]]]
Though Daeron's origins were not recorded, he was known to be in Thingol's service prior to {{YT|1300}}, by which time he had devised his [[Cirth|Runes]], which he would go on to [[Certhas Daeron|greatly better]] with time.<ref name=ga31>{{GA|31}}</ref>

At some point, after the arrival of the [[Green-elves]] in {{YT|1350}}<ref>{{GA|30}}</ref> Daeron became friends with [[Saeros]], who also was skilled in song.<ref>{{CH|5}}</ref> 

In {{FA|20}}, when [[Fingolfin]], [[King of the Noldor]], held the great [[Mereth Aderthad|Feast of Reuniting]], Daeron came as one of the two messengers of Thingol bringing his greetings.<ref>{{GA|72}}</ref>

Daeron was enamoured of Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and [[Melian]], and all his thought of her was set in the music he made for her song and dance.<ref name=beren>{{S|19}}</ref>

=== The arrival of Beren ===
One night, in the mid-summer of {{FA|464}},<ref>{{GA|175}}</ref> Daeron was piping his music and Lúthien came out to dance. Soon though, her feet stilled and she [[Ir Ithil ammen Eruchín|sang a song of such bewildering delight]] that Daeron ceased piping and cast his flute away, heart-broken and wonder bound as stone. As she was singing however, [[Beren]] emerged from the darkness, stumbling as if in doubt or blind. As Lúthien's song ended Daeron, released from its spell, became aware of Beren's presence. Assuming Beren to be an enemy, Daeron fled in dismay, calling for Lúthien to flee and follow him. Lúthien, who had never known fear, initially stood unmoved, but was soon seized by it and vanished.<ref name=""llc"">{{LB|IV}}</ref>

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Daeron spies on Beren and Lúthien.jpg|thumb|right|''Daeron spies on Beren and Lúthien'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In the following spring, of {{FA|465}},<ref>{{GA|177}}</ref> Daeron discovered Lúthien's love for Beren when he espied them dancing together. In an act of jealousy, he then cursed a spell of silence on Doriath, causing a hush to come over birds, trees, and even the river [[Esgalduin]]. This was brought to the attention of Thingol, and he sent for Daeron to ask what omen this silence meant; initially, he was even hopeful that it may be a sign of the return of [[Oromë]]. Daeron however disabused him of that hope, stating that another had entered Doriath and chilled the woods by their strange deeds, and that if the king did not see not the cause, the queen might guess, and the maiden doubtless knew. Thingol, angered by this riddle, ordered Daeron to speak plainly on who was in his woods. Daeron, however, looked on Lúthien and faltered, seeing his disgrace and said no more.<ref name=c4>{{LB|C4}}</ref><ref name=""llc""/>

Lúthien then spoke up and told Thingol of Beren arriving from the north and that she would bring him to Thingol's hall if he promised not to slay him or set him in bonds. Thingol agreed, but after dismissing everyone else spoke in private with Daeron. Thingol wondered what wizardry was brought by this illcomer, and ordered Daeron to secretly watch Lúthien—who he suspected was being ensnared by some trap of Morgoth—and make sure she didn't warn Beren and let him escape. Thingol desired to look upon Beren, and further instructed Daeron to take some archers with him. With heavy heart, Daeron agreed.<ref name=c4 />

<div class=""floatright"">
{{blockquote|<poem>
Silence then fell upon the hall;
like graven stone there stood they all,
save one who cast her eyes aground,
and one who laughed with bitter sound.
Dairon the piper leant there pale          
against a pillar. His fingers frail
there touched a flute that whispered not;
his eyes were dark; his heart was hot.
‘Death is the guerdon thou hast earned,
O baseborn mortal, who hast learned          
in Morgoth’s realm to spy and lurk
like Orcs that do his evil work!’
‘Death!’ echoed Dairon fierce and low,
but Lúthien trembling gasped in woe.
</poem>|Daeron to Beren, ""[[Lay of Leithian Canto IV|The Lay of Leithian]]""}}</div>
True to her word though, Lúthien led Beren into Thingol's halls and before his throne. When Thingol demanded of Beren why he was there, Beren responded that it was for love, and he desired Lúthien. At this, all went silent except for Daeron, who leaned against a pillar and laughed bitterly. With dark eyes and a hot heart, he called for Beren's death, and further insulted him by declaring him a baseborn mortal who learned in Morgoth's realm how to spy and lurk like [[Orc]]s.<ref name=c4 />

Thingol, bound by his oath to Lúthien, did not outright slay Beren, but sought for it indirectly with his impossible demand of a [[Silmaril]] from [[Iron Crown|Morgoth's Crown]] as a bride-price. Beren accepted and after he departed Daeron's curse of silence lifted, though Daeron did not resume his music, nor Lúthien her singing or dancing.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>

=== Escape of Lúthien===
Later, Lúthien learned from Melian that Beren had been captured by [[Sauron]] and in her despair came upon Daeron. She asked him to play music for her heartache and dread, and Daeron reluctantly did so, playing a song of sadness which stayed all things in the woods and caused all mirth to be forgotten. Once he had finished, Lúthien then begged him to accompany her to aid Beren; at this Daeron stated he had no love for Beren nor wept for his captivity, but that he would defend Lúthien from peril and wondering into hell. Lúthien, assuming this meant he would help, thanked him and left, but Daeron instead went directly to Thingol and informed him of Lúthien's intentions. Thingol thanked Daeron, and proclaimed that love would ever be between them, and named him a prince.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>

Out of fear for her safety Thingol put Lúthien into captivity, placing her in a house built high within the great tree [[Hírilorn]], intending to keep her there until she grew wiser and the spell of madness left her. Daeron, grieving for Lúthien's captivity, frequently came to the base of the tree and played melodies on his flute. Lúthien eventually forgave Daeron for his betrayal, and he alone was allowed to cross her threshold. Eventually, she asked Daeron to use his woodcraft and fashion for her a small loom in order to pass the time. Daeron did this, and after giving it to inquired what she planed on making: when she then told him it would be an enchanted thread, Daeron feared the dark purpose of her art, but spoke no word to Thingol of it.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>

After Lúthien departed in secret from Doriath, Daeron sought for her in despair, and wandered upon strange paths until he eventually passed over the [[Blue Mountains]]. For many ages he made lament beside dark waters for Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, most beautiful of all living things.<ref name=beren />

== Characteristics ==
Daeron was physically described as ""Daeron the dark with ferny crown"".<ref name=""llc""/>

He was regarded as among the greatest musicians of the Elves, with only [[Maglor]] named in similar esteem.<ref name=beren />

Thingol described Daeron as wise, with wary ears and watchful eyes, who heeds and understands all who pass through his land.<ref name=""llc"" />

As the Sindar held much in memory it was not their custom to write down their records or songs. As such, save in Menegroth, the Runes of Daeron were little used asides from names and brief inscriptions cut into wood, stone, or metal. The Dwarves who came to Menegroth learned the Cirth and were well-pleased by them, holding Daeron in higher esteem than his own folk; by them then runee were carried east over the Blue Mountains.<ref>{{WJ|P1e}}</ref>

Daeron was also a skilled in woodcraft, as was noted by Lúthien when she requested he make her a small loom.<ref name=c5 />

==Etymology==
The name derives from the [[Sindarin]] word ''daer'' (""large, great"").<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 11</ref>

In the earlier [[Etymologies]] the [[Doriathrin]] name is given as '''Dairon''' shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, ''dai''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 354 entry [[DAY]]</ref>

Consequently, [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', that the name perhaps included the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[dae]]'' ""shadow"".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
'''Dairon''' is first introduced in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. While he plays a near identical role, he is the brother of Tinúviel (Lúthien) rather than an unrequited lover. He is described as ""a boy, strong and merry"" and along with [[Tinfang Warble]] and [[Ivárë]], one of the three most magical music players among the Elves.<ref name=Tinúviel>{{LT2|I}}</ref>

Changes made within the Lost Tales are the children of ""Linwë Tinto"" and ""Wendelin"" being originally '''Timpinen''' (Tinfang) and Tinúviel;<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}</ref>{{rp|note 1}} and the name ""Dairon"" being preceded by '''Tifanto''', which itself was preceded by '''Kapalen'''.<ref name=tin_notes>{{LT2|In}}</ref>{{rp|note 9}}

Tifanto had originally joined the hunting of [[Karkaras]], for which he ""cast aside his pipe and grasped a spear"". As this passage was written after Dairon was already stated as becoming lost [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|his father]], noticing the contradiction, then replaced Dairon at this instance with the new character [[Mablung]].<ref name=tin_notes />{{rp|note 12}}

=== Other ===
In ''[[The Quenta]]'' Dairon was ""the greatest of the musicians of the Elves, save Maglor son of Fëanor, and Tinfang Warble"", though this was emended to ""and Maglor son of Fëanor and Tinfang Gelion alone are named with him"".<ref>{{SM|Q10}}</ref>

In drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', other names were considered for the minstrel of Doriath: ''""[[Ilverin]]""'', ''""Iverin""'', ''""Neldorín""'', ''""Elberin""'', and ''""Diarin""''.<ref>{{RS|Index}}</ref>

In earlier versions of ''[[Narn i Hîn Húrin]]'' Saeros was said to be a kinsman, and then brother, of Daeron.<ref>{{UT|2n}}</ref>{{rp|note 8}}

In a commentary and history on language interrelation, [[Celebrimbor]] was stated as a Sinda who claimed descent from Daeron.<ref>{{PM|XIntro}}</ref>

'''Maeglin''' was an [[Elves|Elf]], the son of [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] and [[Aredhel]] sister of [[Turgon]]. Born in [[Nan Elmoth]], he became mighty in [[Gondolin]] and betrayed it to [[Morgoth]].

== History ==
=== Early history ===
When Aredhel left Gondolin to wander through [[Beleriand]], she met [[Eöl]] in [[Nan Elmoth]]. She stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. The child grew up hearing tales of Gondolin, the Hidden City, and his uncle, Turgon. Most importantly, he heard that he had no heir to the throne, thus the idea of leaving the dark places of Nan Elmoth was born in his mind. Years later, Aredhel left Eöl and she took Maeglin (who stole his father's sword, [[Anguirel]]) with her, both of them returning to Gondolin. However, Eöl had followed her. In judgment before [[Turgon]], he was told that he could not leave Gondolin, and attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart. But he hit Aredhel instead when she sprang before Maeglin to protect him. She later died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls under Maeglin's eyes; his father prophesied that he would die the same death.<ref name=Maeglin/>

He was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He found rich lodes of metals in the [[Echoriath]] surrounding the city, and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the northern Echoriath was named ''[[Anghabar]]'', which provided a great wealth of steel and forged metals.<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> 

In the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], also known as the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon, proving valiant at need, though he was wise in council as well.<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> He was present when Turgon and Húrin met in the middle of the battle, and heard the prophetic words of his king, and he didn't forget them.<ref>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref> After the army of the Gondolindrim came back from battle, the seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the [[Gate of Steel]], was created by Maeglin.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 49-50</ref>
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Evil in His Heart.jpg|thumb|''Evil in his heart'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]] 
Even though he was one of the mighty of Gondolin, he most desired Turgon's daughter [[Idril]], who was his first cousin. But there was no hope for him, as the ""[[Eldar]] wedded not with kin so near"". Moreover, Idril perceived an evil coming from him, and for as long as Gondolin existed, she avoided him. Thus, the love inside Maeglin's heart turned to darkness. Though he had neither her nor the kingship of Gondolin, he endured it in silence, waiting for an opportunity to seize them both.<ref name=Maeglin />

=== Fall of Gondolin ===
When [[Tuor]] came, carrying [[Ulmo's warning]] of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. Tuor's marriage with Idril further incensed Maeglin, who rebelled against Turgon and Tuor. Later, seeking after metals, Maeglin defied Turgon's order to stay within the mountains, and was captured by [[Orcs]] and brought to [[Angband]]. [[Morgoth]] promised both Gondolin and Idril in return for the location of the hidden city, thus luring Maeglin into the greatest treachery done in the [[Elder Days]].

Maeglin returned to Gondolin saying nothing about his encounter, but many people noticed a change. Most thought it was for the better, though Idril suspected something and began work on [[Idril's secret way]]. When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] took place, Maeglin laid hands on Idril and on her son [[Eärendil]]. But Tuor caught up with him and they fought upon the walls of the city. Maeglin lost and he was thrown down to his death, striking the mountain three times before falling into the flames.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Maeglin'' means ""Sharp Glance"" in [[Sindarin]], a name which he received from his father when he was twelve. It is formed by the union of ''[[maeg]]'' (""sharp, piercing, ""penetrating"") and ''[[glîn]]'' (""gleam, glint (of eyes)"").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''maeg'', ''glîn''</ref> 

At birth, Aredhel gave Maeglin the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of '''''Lómion''''', meaning ""Child of Twilight"" in [[Quenya]]. It comes from ''[[lómë]]'' (""twilight"")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''lómë''</ref>  + ''[[-ion]]'' (patronymic suffix). This name was given to him in secret, as Quenya was forbidden and because only Eöl gave a name to his son when he was twelve years old.<ref name=Maeglin />

[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Maeglin laid hands on Idril, and on Earendil.jpg|right|thumb|''Maeglin laid hands on Idril, and on Earendil'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]
Maeglin is called '''''Meglin''''' in the early versions of the [[legendarium]]. This [[Gnomish]] name is not glossed and its [[Qenya]] cognate was ''Mailin/Mailindo''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, pp. 103-4</ref>

The most detailed text about Meglin and his evil deeds during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]"", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. There it is told that he was a [[Gnome]]-lord, son of Isfin and Eöl, and nephew of king Turgon, although some whispered he had Orc's blood in his veins. His sign was a sable Mole and he was a chief of the delvers, and many of them belonged to his house.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|165}} This house was the [[folk of the Mole]], one of the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]]. He had gathered them chosing warriors of dark countenance and lowering gaze.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|173}}
At some point he was captured by Orcs while looking for ore, and knowing he was of the [[Gondothlim]], they would kill him, but he offered himself to Melko and was taken to the Hills of Iron. Hearing the treachery, Melko was pleased, and together they planned how to take the city. Meglin gave Melko the idea of building [[Iron Dragons]] to carry Orcs. Then he came back to the city, but Melko wove upon him the spell of bottomless dread.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|169}}

Seven years later, the armies of Melko approached Gondolin and Turgon called a council. All the lords supported Tuor, who wanted to leave the city and save the women and children, but Meglin and [[Salgant]] alone convinced [[Turgon]] to hold the city and guard the treasures, and while he spoke Salgant backed him up.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|175–6}}

When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began at the northern gate, Meglin led his folk to [[Tuor]]'s house at the south of the city. He knew of [[Idril's secret way]] and wanted to use it for his own purposes. There he tried to kill [[Eärendel]] throwing him from the walls, and dragged Idril of her hair to make her see it. But Eärendel and Idril fought him, delaying him. Tuor soon arrived with his [[folk of the Wing]]. But a press of the Mole-folk was in front of the house, and these were the grimmest Noldoli that Meglin could get, doing nothing to stop their lord. Then the folk of the Wing attacked and the folk of the Mole was stricken asunder, and Tuor could run upon Meglin. When Meglin saw this, he stabbed Eärendel, but the child was wearing a coat, and Tuor broke Meglin's arm. Finally, Tuor took Meglin and flung him far out. The body smote Amon Gwareth three times before reaching the flames, ""and the name of Meglin has gone out in shame from among the Eldar and Noldoli"".<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|177–8}}

{{Quote|In Beleriand King Thingol upon his throne was as the lords of the [[Maiar]], whose power is at rest, whose joy is as an air that they breathe in all their days, whose thought flows in a tide untroubled from the heights to the deeps.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Sindar]]""}}

'''Elwë''', better known as '''Thingol''', was one of the two Kings of the [[Teleri]], the other being his younger brother [[Olwë]].

As the [[King of Doriath]] and the acknowledged high-king of the [[Sindar]] in [[Beleriand]],<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, note 11</ref> Thingol would become a central figure of the [[First Age]], instigating the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], one of the most significant events of the First Age, but ultimately the cause of his own doom.

Thingol, alone of all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], married one of the [[Ainur]] - the [[Maia]] [[Melian]], and through their daughter [[Lúthien]] he became the ancestor to all the kings of the [[Dúnedain]] including [[Aragorn]].

==History==
===Ambassador of the Valar===
Elwë was born at [[Cuiviénen]] in the days before the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]], when [[Middle-earth]] was lit only by starlight. 

After the [[Chaining of Melkor]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Oromë]] took three Elves, [[Ingwë]], Finwë, and Elwë, to [[Valinor]] to convince the [[Elves]] to join the Valar in the [[Blessed Realm]]. Upon their return, the Elven ambassadors convinced many to join them on the [[Great Journey]] to the West.  During the thousand mile journey, the Elven host separated into three groups, the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the Teleri.<ref name=""capt"">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

The Teleri were the largest folk and they were divided in two hosts, led by Elwë and his brother Olwë. Elwë was more eager than his brother to see again Valinor, and wished to catch up with the Noldor because of his friendship with Finwë; but the Teleri were also the slowest and were the last to reach the western shores of Middle-earth.<ref name=""capt"" />

After many years the Teleri crossed the [[Blue Mountains]] and stayed for some time in [[East Beleriand]].<ref name=""capt"" /> During this time Elwë returned from a meeting with his friend Finwë, and wandered into the [[Nan Elmoth|Forest of Nan Elmoth]], where he met and fell in love with [[Melian]] the [[Maiar|Maia]]. Caught in an enchantment of their own making, Elwë and Melian could not be found by the searching Teleri. When the Valar returned to take the remaining Elves to Valinor, only some of them followed Olwë across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. The rest had come to love the lands of [[Beleriand]] and refused to leave without their missing lord.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

===King of Doriath===
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Elwë heraldic device.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Elwë's device with the Winged Moon by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
In {{YT|1152}}, Elwë awoke from his trance and reappeared with his bride Melian.<ref>{{AA|74}}</ref> He was much changed since his people last they saw him: while he had been fair and noble before, he now stood like a Maia above them as the tallest of the Children of Ilúvatar. He gathered his people together and founded the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. His subjects would become the Sindar, or the ""Grey Elves"", and their language was [[Sindarin]]. From then on Elwë was known as King Elu Thingol, and he claimed lordship over all the lands in [[Beleriand]]. While Thingol was king of the Grey Elves, he saw the light of the [[Two Trees]] as an ambassador of the Valar and thus he was counted as a [[High Elves|High Elf]], and equal to any lord of the Eldar.<ref name=""Princes"" /><ref name=""Thingol"">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> He was even acknowledged as high-king of all the Teleri in Beleriand, even after Doriath became hidden.<ref name=""PM"" />

On Melian's advice, Thingol became an ally of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]], who carved the caverns of [[Menegroth]] for him. In payment he gave them, along with many other things, the great pearl [[Nimphelos]].<ref name=""Thingol"" />

A thousand years before the first rising of the Sun and the Moon the [[Green-elves]] entered Beleriand under [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]]. Thingol welcomed them and gave them the lands of [[Ossiriand]], which they named [[Lindon]]. The Green Elves told of the spread of the [[Orcs]] and other foul creatures in the north and east of Middle-earth. The Grey Elves began arming themselves.<ref name=""Thingol"" />

Centuries later [[Melkor]] returned to Middle-earth. Now named Morgoth, he had destroyed the Two Trees, killed Finwë, the King of the Noldor, and stolen the fabled [[Silmarils]]. Seeking to claim dominion quickly, he launched a sudden assault on the lands of the Sindar. The [[First Battle of Beleriand]] went well for Thingol, who prevented any Orcs from invading Doriath, but the Green Elves took horrific losses and the [[Falathrim]] were besieged.<ref name=""Thingol"" />

The Falathrim were finally saved by the unexpected arrival of the Noldor, who launched the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (""Battle Under the Stars"") in which Morgoth's forces were all but annihilated.<ref name=""Return"">{{S|Return}}</ref>

===Thingol and the Noldor===
[[File:Elena Kukanova - King of Doriath.jpg|thumb|left|''King of Doriath'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
After the First Battle of Beleriand, Doriath was encircled by the [[Girdle of Melian]], an impenetrable fence of enchantment that guarded the kingdom.<ref name=""Thingol"" /> While his own kingdom was protected, Thingol was still loath to surrender any other lands in Beleriand to the Noldor as he was suspicious of the aggressive new lords in Middle-earth.<ref name=""Return"" />
{{blockquote|In [[Hithlum]] the Noldor have leave to dwell, and in the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], and in the lands east of Doriath that are empty and wild... for I am the Lord of Beleriand, and all who seek to dwell there shall hear my word.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Return of the Noldor]]""}}

King Thingol's relations with the Noldor were strained, and grew worse decades later when he learned the truth of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. Thingol banned the use of [[Quenya]] in his lands, which led to Sindarin being the common Elven tongue in Middle-earth. The King of Doriath refused to aid the Noldor in the war against Morgoth, and took little part in the ongoing struggle.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>

===Quest for the Silmaril===
[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Beren at Thingol's Court.jpg|thumb|''Beren at Thingol's Court'' by [[Felix Sotomayor]]]]
{{Quote|If thou fearest neither spell, wall nor weapons, as thou saist, then go fetch me a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Then we will give jewel for jewel, but thou shalt win the fairer: Lúthien of the First-born and of the Gods.|Thingol, ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', ""The Gray Annals""}}
Thingol and Melian had one child, a daughter named [[Lúthien]], said to be the fairest woman ever to live. Lúthien fell in love with a [[Men|Man]] named [[Beren]]. Thingol did not wish for the two to wed, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of [[Morgoth]], thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand.<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

However, when Beren and Lúthien came back from [[Angband]], and when Beren showed him his missing hand which still held the Silmaril in the belly of [[Carcharoth]], he softened his heart towards him. Soon, though, Carcharoth in his anguish and rage from the Silmaril that burned his insides, broke through the Girdle of Melian and entered Doriath. In that hour, Thingol, along with Beren, [[Mablung]], [[Beleg]], and [[Huan]] the Hound of Valinor, began the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. Carcharoth was finally slain by Huan, but both Huan and Beren died in the process. After that, Lúthien died also, and coming to the [[Halls of Mandos]] she begged [[Mandos]] that Beren be returned to life. However, it was beyond the power of Mandos to withhold the souls of Men from going beyond the [[Circles of the World]].<ref name=""Beren"" />

Therefore, [[Ilúvatar]], through [[Manwë]], offered Lúthien and Beren the opportunity to live again, but with Lúthien sharing the [[Gift of Men]]. She agreed, and they both came back to life and lived out the remainder of their second lives at [[Tol Galen]], far from the sight of any other mortals.<ref name=""Beren"" />

===Fostering of Túrin===
Thingol adopted as a son a young Man named [[Túrin]], son of [[Húrin]] and akin to Beren himself, who was sent to Doriath when he was seven years old.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref> When he grew up, he was permitted to join Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the Orcs of Morgoth.<ref name=""Turin"">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|5}}</ref>

Túrin accidentally caused the death of [[Saeros]], one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven he fled. Thingol however gave Beleg a leave to seek out his friend, who in the meantime had joined a [[Gaurwaith|band of outlaws]].<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref> Telling to Thingol that Túrin did not wish to return, Thingol allowed Beleg to go and join his friend and gave him the black sword [[Anglachel]] that [[Eöl]] had forged and given to Thingol<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> in tribute.<ref name=""Turin"" />

===Nauglamír and death===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Thingol's End.jpg|thumb|right|''Thingol's End'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Sometime after Túrin's tragic death, Húrin, now an old man released from Morgoth's captivity, was allowed to enter Menegroth. In anger, he threw the [[Nauglamír]], the treasure of [[Nargothrond]], before King Thingol, bitterly ""thanking"" him for aiding his son. Melian pierced through Húrin's madness and grief; shamed by his actions, he offered the Nauglamír to Thingol sincerely and left Menegroth a broken man.<ref name=""Doriath"">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

At that time, a desire came into Thingol's heart to take the Nauglamír and place the Silmaril into it, thus melding together two of the greatest creations made by the Elves and the Dwarves. He hired skilled [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarven craftsmen]], but they secretly desired to possess both treasures for themselves. After their work was completed, the Dwarves refused to give the Nauglamír to Thingol, claiming that he had no right to own the priceless necklace made by their ancestors. Realizing that they were coveting the Silmaril, Thingol became infuriated and insulted them. The Dwarves were angered by his harsh words and killed him. This led to the [[battle in the Thousand Caves|sacking of Menegroth]] and the eventual [[Second Kinslaying|destruction of Doriath]], which scattered its people.<ref name=""Doriath"" />

==Characteristics==
His hair was grey as silver, his eyes were as stars, and he was the tallest of all the Elven-folk.<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}</ref>{{rp|§27}} which means that he was taller than Elendil, probably the tallest man, who was 7'11"" or 2.41 m tall.<ref name=""linear"">{{UT|Linear}}, note concerning the different routes from Osgiliath to Imladris, first paragraph</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Elwe Singollo.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Thingol''' was his [[epessë|anessë]] (given name) in [[Sindarin]], which means ""Greycloak""<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, p. 217</ref> or Greymantle.<ref name=""Thingol"">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> The first element of the name is ''thin(d)'' (""grey"").<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''thin(d)''</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q '''sinda''', p. 72</ref> Paul Strack suggests that the second element ''gol'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''coll'' (""cloak"", ""mantle"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3589954001.html|articlename=S. ''Thingol'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=10 May 2024}}</ref>

==Other names==
[[Quenya]] tradition names him '''''Elwë''''' and ''[[Singollo]]'', for the [[Noldor]] pronounced his epessë as '''''Singollo'''''.{{fact}}

His first name, ''Elwë'', means ""star-man"" and contains ''[[el]]'' and ''[[-we]]''.

'''''Elwë Þindicollo''''' or '''Sindicollo''' was the ancient name of King Thingol; when he settled in [[Doriath]] with [[Melian]], he took the [[Sindarin]] form of his name, ''Elu Thingol''.

He stopped to listen for what he thought was a moment, although in reality it lasted many years. He came upon her in the forest, where she lay listening also to the nightingales. Thinking her very beautiful, he began to approach her, but she rose and ran away laughing. He then fell into a deep sleep while she remained, and kept watch over him a long time. His people, who had long ago departed to Valinor, were forgotten by Tinwelint when he at last awoke and found her still nearby. Eventually the two were wed.<ref name=""lt2i"" />

==History==
===Early History===
{{seealso|#Other versions of the legendarium}}

Thranduil's birth date and early life are not recorded.  He may have been born in the First Age, or early Second Age. He was of Sindarin descent. His father [[Oropher]] was originally one of the [[Iathrim]] of [[Doriath]].<ref name=""Princes"">{{UT|6b}}</ref>

[[Image:Anna Lee - Thranduil and Legolas.jpg|left|thumb|''Thranduil and Legolas'' by [[Anna Lee]]]]

Many of the Sindar left [[Lindon]] and travelled eastward before the building of the [[Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|1000}}.<ref name=""AppB"">{{App|B}}</ref> Thranduil is first recorded in this event, when he and his father, [[Oropher]], arrived ""with only a handful of Sindar""<ref name=""Princes"" /> in {{SA|750}}, in [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref name=""foundation"">{{PM|Second}}</ref> Oropher was taken by the [[Silvan Elves]] as their lord and founded the [[Woodland Realm]].<ref name=""Princes"" />

The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] joined the [[Last Alliance]] and in {{SA|3434}}, Thranduil followed his father and numerous lightly armed Elves in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. In the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], Oropher was slain in the first assault upon Mordor, ""rushing forward at the head of his most doughty warriors before Gil-galad had given the signal for the advance.""<ref name=""Princes"" /> His son survived, but over the course of the war, two-thirds of his people had perished. After the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|3441}}, when [[Sauron]] was defeated, Thranduil led the remainder of his people north back to the Woodland Realm, where he was crowned king.<ref name=""Princes"" />

===Third Age===
====The Shadow Returns====
Upon the return of [[Sauron]] - disguised as the [[Sauron|Necromancer]] - in around {{TA|1050}}, southern Greenwood became increasingly dangerous; evil creatures such as the great [[spiders]] came to dwell in it and the forest soon came to be known as ""[[Mirkwood]]"".<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Thranduil's folk retreated to the north of the forest, where they established themselves near the [[Forest River]]. Thranduil had [[Elvenking's Halls|his halls]] delved underground, fashioned partly in memory (it was said) of the mighty, but long-lost, [[Menegroth]] of [[Doriath]].<ref group=""note"">In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it is stated by [[Gimli]] that the [[Dwarves]] aided in the making of Thranduil's halls. However, in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', it is stated that Thranduil's halls ""were not to be compared with [[Menegroth]]. He had not the arts nor wealth nor the aid of the Dwarves.""</ref><ref name=""Princes"" /><ref>{{TT|Road}}</ref> In north-eastern Mirkwood, they were near the Forest River behind great, stone gates. 

====Battle of Five Armies====
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Thorin and Thranduil.jpeg|thumb|right|''Thorin and Thranduil'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In {{TA|2941}}, Thranduil and some of his folk were feasting in the woods when they were repeatedly disturbed by [[Thorin and Company|a party]] of [[Dwarves]]. After the third disturbance, the Elves captured [[Thorin]] who refused to reveal to Thranduil the reason for their journey through Mirkwood.<ref name=""Flies"" /> Following their battle with the spiders, the rest of [[Thorin and Company|the company]] was also captured by the Elves. Following their repeated failure to explain their presence in Mirkwood, Thranduil placed all the Dwarves under lock and key. They escaped, however, with the aid of a Hobbit, [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Baggins had evaded capture by Thranduil's people through the use of [[The One Ring|his magic ring]].

After the Dwarves' escape, Thranduil received word of what had transpired from the [[Raft-elves]] who returned up the [[Forest River]]. Thus he was now aware of the Dwarves' quest. Upon learning this, he stated, ""no treasure will come back through Mirkwood without my having something to say in the matter.""<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> He believed the Dwarves were incapable of slaying the Dragon. However, he soon heard from his own messengers (including the birds) that the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] had been felled (and the [[Lake-town]] was destroyed).

Thranduil was aware that Smaug had a massive hoard of treasure. Believing the Dwarves to be dead, and desiring a share of the treasure, he set out towards the [[Lonely Mountain]] with a company of Elves. On the way, they met messengers from [[Bard]] who was seeking aid for his destroyed town. Thranduil gave aid to these Men, as the [[Lake-men]] had been friends with the Wood-elves, and left elven craftsmen to aid in the labour and building of huts to fortify them against the coming winter.<ref name=""Fire"">{{H|Fire}}</ref> Together, Thranduil and Bard led their forces towards the Lonely Mountain and were surprised when they found out that the Dwarves not only survived Smaug's attacks, but had taken possession of the Mountain and its treasures; the [[King under the Mountain]] had returned.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|left|''The Arkenstone'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

As Thorin refused to give away any part of the treasure for [[Dale]] and Lake-town under armed threat, Thranduil and Bard besieged the mountain. After a few days, a Dwarvish host led by [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]], who had been summoned by [[Ravens|raven]] messengers, approached to support Thorin. But, two evenings before his arrival, Bilbo came before Thranduil and Bard bringing the [[Arkenstone]], a great jewel that Thorin valued above all, in order to make Thorin open to negotiations again. Thranduil was impressed by Bilbo and urged him to remain in order to avoid Thorin's wrath, but Bilbo returned to his friends. The next morning Bard and Thranduil entered into negotiations with an angered Thorin, who agreed to pay one-fourteenth share of the treasure in exchange for the stone. Thranduil was reluctant to start a war over gold, but when the forces of Dáin arrived the next day, before the trade had been made for the Arkenstone, the Dwarves proceeded to attack.

[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Battle.jpeg|thumb|''The Battle'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
At that moment, the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] under [[Bolg]] were using the opportunity to march after the hoard, and he was accompanied by a cloud of great bats. After skirmishing among themselves, under the council of Gandalf, the three commanders agreed that the Goblins were the enemies of all. So the [[Battle of Five Armies]] began, ""upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves.""<ref name=""Burst"">{{H|Burst}}</ref> Thranduil's host was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and they were the first to charge. Many Elves and allies were slain and things looked grim when the [[Eagles]] and [[Beorn]] arrived on the battlefield. They turned the tide and the battle was won.

Thorin died soon after the battle. Thranduil laid [[Orcrist]] on Thorin's tomb, where it was said to glow in warning when foes approached.

The victors divided the treasure, with Bard giving Thranduil the emeralds of [[Girion]]. When Bilbo and [[Gandalf]] bade farewell to Thranduil, Bilbo gave him a necklace of silver and pearls. Thranduil gave the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] the title [[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]] and returned with the remainder of his host to his realm in Mirkwood.

====War of the Ring====
On [[21 March]], {{TA|3018}} [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] delivered [[Gollum]] as a prisoner to Thranduil; but in June he later escaped. Thranduil sent his son [[Legolas]] to Rivendell to inform [[Elrond]], and during the [[Council of Elrond]] Legolas was selected as one of the nine members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name=""council"">{{FR|II2}}</ref> Another member of the Company was the Dwarf, [[Gimli]], the son of [[Glóin]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]], who had previously been imprisoned by Thranduil. The unprecedented friendship between Elf and Dwarf helped to reconcile Thranduil's people and the Dwarves.

On [[15 March]], {{TA|3019}}, [[Sauron]]'s army from [[Dol Guldur]] attacked Mirkwood. There was a long [[battle under the trees]] and the woods were set on fire, but in the end Thranduil was victorious. And after the passing of Sauron, the [[Galadhrim|forces]] of the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]] stormed Dol Guldur and threw down its walls, finally cleansing the forest.<ref name=""great"">{{App|Great}}</ref>

On [[6 April]]<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> (the [[Yestarë|day of the Elven New Year]]), the Elvenking met with [[Celeborn]] in the midst of Mirkwood and renamed it ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]'', ""The Wood of the Greenleaves"". With the forest cleansed and Sauron's forces destroyed, the forest was divided; Celeborn claimed the southern part of the forest north to the Narrows, Thranduil took the northern part of the forest south to the [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Mountains]], and the two Elf-lords granted the middle to the [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]].<ref name=""great"" />

===Fourth Age===
The partition of Eryn Lasgalen is the last reference to Thranduil in the histories of Middle-earth. It is not said that he joined his son Legolas in settling Ithilien or in departing over the Sea.<ref name=""AppBLater"">{{App|Later}}</ref> Presumably, he continued to rule the re-established Woodland Realm into the Fourth Age, but nothing of this is known for certain, as he could have sailed to the West at some unknown date.{{Fact}}<ref group=""note"" name=""Departure"">Thranduil's deeds during the Fourth Age are completely unknown and his fate remains uncertain; yet the later can be deduced by combining the conjecture made in regards of his birth (which is displayed in [note 1]) and a passage from ''[[Fellowship of the Ring]]''. ""[...] but there is no record of the day when at last he [Celeborn] sought the [[Grey Havens]], and with him went the last living memory of the [[Elder Days]] in Middle-earth."" If Thranduil had been born in Doriath prior its ruin, then it would be certain that he had journeyed to the West; being born during the ""Elder Days"". However, had he been born in the early Second Age, his possible departure would remain undetermined.</ref>

==Personality==
[[Image:Marya Filatova - Thranduil.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Thranduil by [[Marya Filatova]]'']] Although his concern was primarily for his realm, the memory of the end of the [[Second Age]] and what lay outside his borders haunted him:
{{blockquote|But there was in Thranduil's heart a still deeper shadow. He had seen the horror of [[Mordor]] and could not forget it. If ever he looked south its memory dimmed the light of the Sun, and though he knew that it was now broken and deserted and under the vigilance of the Kings of Men, fear spoke in his heart that it was not conquered for ever; it would arise again.|''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ""[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]"", ""Appendix B: The Sindarin Princes of the Silvan Elves""}}

Thranduil lived in atunement with nature, wearing a crown of woodland flowers, or autumn berries and red leaves, according to the season.<ref name=""Barrels"">{{H|Barrels}}</ref> His banner was green in colour.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref> He loved the forest, though it was dark and dangerous in many parts; and enjoyed hunting and feasting among the trees with his people.<ref name=""Flies"">{{H|Flies}}</ref> He was distrustful of strangers for the most part, although he had business dealings with the men of [[Lake-town]].<ref name=""Barrels"" /> He was mostly unconcerned with affairs of the world beyond Mirkwood unless a common enemy was shared or for trade with ""their kinsfolk in the South, or [...] Men in distant lands.""<ref name=""Barrels"" /> 

He had a particular fondness for white gems and wanted to acquire more: ""if the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and though his hoard was rich, was eager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as other elf-lords of old.""<ref name=""Flies"" /> Despite this weakness, he was wise and would not wantonly go to war, risking his people's lives, over treasure. This was evidenced when the Elvenking said, ""long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold [...] let us hope still for something that will bring reconciliation.""<ref name=""Burst"" />

==Etymology==
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Thranduil.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
The name '''''Thranduil''''' means ""Vigorous spring"" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[tharan]]'' (""vigorous"") and [[Lenition|lenited]] ''[[tuil]]'' (""spring""). Though the name is said to be of [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan]] origin, Tolkien's notes on ''tharan'' state it was used only in Sindarin.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 27, 187</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The published [[Appendix B]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as one of its drafts,<ref name=""foundation"">{{PM|Second}}</ref> mention Thranduil as King of the Woodland realm, founded in {{SA|750}}, suggesting (but not explicitly mentioning) that he was possibly its founder and first king.

His father Oropher was invented later, while Tolkien was fleshing out the background of Thranduil and the history of the Silvan realms, given a far older origin, explicitly clarifying that Thranduil was not the founder of the realm, and he only succeeded his father after the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. Oropher and Thranduil's backstory were never incorporated in more ""canonical"" narratives, and the drafts exploring them were published in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.<ref name=""Princes"" /><ref group=""note"" name=""Birth""></ref>

===Films===
'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Thranduil is voiced by [[Otto Preminger]]. For some reason, in the movie, the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] are portrayed as squat and ugly, as opposed to the noble Elves of [[Rivendell]]. Like Fenton before him, Preminger's Thranduil speaks with a German accent.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Thranduil is played by [[Lee Pace]] in the ''Hobbit'' [[The Hobbit (film series)|film trilogy]].<ref name=""PJCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150239464391558|articlename=Casting news!|dated=30-April-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> Thranduil is first seen in the prologue paying homage to King [[Thrór]] inside within the [[Lonely Mountain]], though leaves in a huff when the [[Dwarves]] refuse to give him a box of white jewels. He is next seen with an army outside of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] riding an elk, seemingly ready to help during the [[Sack of Erebor]]. However, he decides not to help and turns away.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Mentioning his past, Thranduil is portrayed as a widower and also an isolationist king who isn't concerned with the evil that happens beyond his borders. He has generously raised [[Tauriel]] for the last 600 years, and also mentions that he has fought the ""[[cold-drakes|serpents of the North]]"".
:When [[Thorin]] is taken before Thranduil in the [[Elvenking's Halls]], he surmises that he and his [[Thorin and Company|Company]] are going to try to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] from [[Smaug]] (unlike in the book, where he had no idea as to their purpose). He offers a deal to Thorin, saying he will let the Company go if they will pay him the white jewels he desires inside the Mountain. When the Dwarf refuses and chastises him for not offering aid to the [[Dwarves of Erebor|Dwarves]] the day of the Sack, the Elven-king reveals a large disfigurement on his face underneath his skin, mentioning his fighting against the 'great serpents of the North.'
:Later, an [[unseen|invisible]] Bilbo Baggins spies his discussion with Tauriel, having ordered her company of Elves to destroy the [[spiders]]'s nests, but not beyond the borders of the Woodland Realm, displaying his disregard for the outside world.
:He and Legolas interrogate [[Narzug]], a captured [[Orcs|Orc]] who claims that [[Sauron|""The One""]] is returning, and will unleash a powerful weapon (possibly Smaug). Despite his own promise to ""set him free"", he beheads the orc, and orders the kingdom to be completely sealed off from the outside world.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:After learning of [[Smaug]]'s demise, Thranduil leads his Elven army to claim the white jewels from the Dwarves of Erebor, even by force. It is revealed that these jewels were meant for his wife, who had been taken to [[Gundabad]] and tortured by Orcs to death many years prior. When the army arrives in [[Dale]], he forges an allegiance with [[Bard]], also offering the [[Lake-town]] refugees food and supplies. When Gandalf arrives at Erebor to warn them of the impending attack by the approaching Orc army, the Elven-king refuses to listen. Thranduil's soldiers come to clashes with those of [[Dáin Ironfoot]] right before the Orcs arrive, leading to the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thranduil himself fights in the battle against the Orcs, but withdraws his forces when defence of Dale results in many Elven casualties. This leads to a confrontation between him and [[Tauriel]] before she and [[Legolas]] go to Thorin's aid at [[Ravenhill]]. The event causes a rift between Thranduil and his son, to the point where Legolas decides not to return to the kingdom. Thranduil then advises him to go and find the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] known as ""[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]"" among the [[Dúnedain]]. The Elven-king also accepts Tauriel's love for [[Kíli]] when he finds her mourning over the Dwarf's death.

===Radio series===
'''1968: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Leonard Fenton]] provided the voice of Thranduil. He provides him with a Germanic accent.

'''1980: [[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]:'''
:The Elven-king is played by Martin Hirthe.

'''1989: [[Hobit (1989 Slovak radio series)|''Hobit'' (1989 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of the Elven-king is provided by Alfréd Swan. He is not identified by his personal name, in keeping with the original novel.

===Games===
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:Thranduil is referred to as ""Elvenking Thranduil"", using both his title from ''The Hobbit'' and his name from ''The Lord of the Rings'', to accommodate players who have only read ''The Hobbit''. Thranduil first appears in the level ""Barrels Out of Bond"", in which he can be overheard speaking about the [[White Council]] and their attack on [[Dol Guldur]]. He returns as a conversation partner in the last level, ""The Clouds Burst"", in which he and Gandalf ask the player, in the persona of Bilbo, to deliver a message to Bard. No voice actor is specified for this part.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Thranduil is a hero for the Elven faction. In the good campaign, he shows up after the [[Battle of Dale]], and participates in the Siege of [[Dol Guldur]].

'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Thranduil's earliest appearances are during the War of the [[Last Alliance]]. He can be found during the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and later is seen during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].

:In the present time, Thranduil is first encountered fighting in [[Mirkwood]] during the last days of the [[War of the Ring]]. He joins the forces of Lord [[Celeborn]] and Lady [[Galadriel]] and their combined host moves on [[Dol Guldur]] where Galadriel brings down the fortress. Afterwards he and Celeborn renamed the forest [[Eryn Lasgalen]] and divide it into three parts, giving the middle section to the [[Woodmen]]. Thranduil then returns to his halls in Felegoth where his son [[Legolas]] and the player join him after the [[One Ring]] is destroyed. Thranduil's people have to deal with an unexpected situation when most of spiders in Mirkwood, except for the very young or very old ones, suddenly depart the forest en masse, travelling south to answer the call of [[Shelob|their mother]]. In their place come the Wood-trolls from the north and Thranduil tasks the player with finding the source of the new threat and preventing it from reaching his borders.

'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War]]'':'''
:Thraduil is a flawless rarity commander for the [[Lothlórien|Elves]] Faction and is extremely hard to get loyalty for.

'''Irmo''', commonly called ''[[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]'' after his place of dwelling, was a [[Valar|Vala]] who was known as ""the master of visions and dreams.""

==History==
Irmo was the younger brother of [[Mandos|Námo]], who was also more commonly known by the name of his dwelling place, ''[[Mandos]]''. Irmo and Námo were known collectively as the [[Fëanturi]], the masters of spirits.<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIb}}</ref> Their sister was [[Nienna]], the [[Valar|Valie]] of pity and sorrow. 

Irmo lived in his gardens with his spouse [[Estë]] with their dwelling lying west of [[Valimar]].

Irmo tended to and provided refuge to the [[Elves]] of Valinor in Lórien, where would guide the [[Eldar]] through visions and dreams.<ref name=""vala"" /> When [[Míriel]] lost strength after giving birth to [[Fëanor]], she was brought to Lórien for rest. Her spirit later departed to [[Mandos]] and refused to return.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

When the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] were created, [[Varda]] purposed that the two vessels should journey in [[Ilmen]] and mingle their light as the [[Two Trees]] once had. However, Irmo and Estë asked her to reconsider as ""sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth.""<ref name=""Sun"" /> Therefore, Varda changed her council and created twilight.<ref name=""Sun"">{{S|11}}</ref>

''Irmo'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning ""Desirer"" or ""Master of Desire"".<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> His common name ''Lórien'' ([[Quenya]]; {{IPA|[ˈloːri.en]}}) means ""Land of Dreams"".

{{quote|Lo, Manwë Súlimo clad in sapphires, ruler of the airs and wind, is held lord of Gods and Elves and Men, and the greatest bulwark against the evil of Melko.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', ""[[The Music of the Ainur]]""}}

'''Manwë Súlimo''' was the King of the [[Valar]], husband of [[Varda]] Elentári, brother of the [[Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (Morgoth), and '''High King of [[Arda]]'''. The winds, airs and birds were his servants. He was the greatest of the [[Ainur]] in authority, but not in power. The Lord of the Breath of Arda, he was appointed as its Ruler, hence his most common title, the '''Elder King'''.

==Attributes==
Manwë was the Ainu dearest to Eru, closest to his mind, and appointed his viceregent on Earth. He was king, lord of Arda, and ruler of everything that dwells therein. His spouse is [[Varda]], and they are seldom parted. His attributes are air and the winds, from the [[Veil of Arda]] to the small breezes. He also commands the birds.<ref name=""vala"" /> From the beginning, [[Ulmo]] has been his closest friend and ally. They come together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.<ref name=""ai"" /> 

He lived in [[Ilmarin|his halls]] atop Mount [[Taniquetil]], the highest mountain of the world. Together with Varda he could see farther than all other eyes. All things that flew in the light were his servants and brought him news from the farthest and deepest places of the world; save dark places in the deep that were Ulmo's domain<ref name=""vala"" /> or those hid by the black thought of powerful evil.

As the vicegerent of Eru on Earth, Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power. Manwë dressed in blue robes and had blue eyes. He wielded a scepter of sapphire made for him by the [[Noldor]]. The [[Vanyar]] were his favorite Elves, and they lived with him and Varda on Mount [[Oiolosse]], and he delighted in their songs and poetry.<ref name=""s1"">{{S|1}}</ref>

As every finite creature must have some weakness, Manwë's inherent fault was to become engrossed in amendment, healing, re-ordering — even ‘keeping the status quo’ — to the loss of all creative power and even to weakness in dealing with difficult and perilous situations. This applied to Manwë's dealings with Melkor, which were partly out of sheer fear of him, and partly out of desire to control him.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}</ref>{{rp|522}}

==History==
In the thought of Ilúvatar, Manwë was the brother of Melkor, but dearest to Ilúvatar and the one that best understood the will of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]].<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIb}}</ref> When Melkor created the discord in the second [[Song of the Ainur]], Manwë took over leading the song, pondering about airs and winds.<ref name=""ai"">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> 

Manwë along with [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]] were the chief architects of [[Arda]], and when it was formed, he denied to surrender it to Melkor. Many [[spirits]], like [[Varda]], came to his side from the deeps of [[Ea]].<ref name=""ai"" />

He did not understand evil, even in the form of his own brother. He released Melkor from [[Mandos]], thus allowing him to cause the distrust of [[Fëanor]], the [[Darkening of Valinor|Poisoning]] of the [[Two Trees]], the murder of [[Finwë]], the theft of the [[Silmarils]], and the revolt of the [[Noldor]]. 

To hearten the [[Eldar]], he had [[Aulë]] fashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the [[Atani]] was coming soon, and sent [[Thorondor]] and the [[Great Eagles]] to watch them. 

After Morgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the [[Void]]. In the [[Final Battle]], when Melkor escapes, it is said that the Elder King and the Dark Lord will battle on the Plains of [[Valinor]], but that they will not slay each other.

==Etymology==
''Manwë'' is intended to mean ""Blessed One"" in [[Quenya]], from [[root]] ''MAN'' plus the male ending ''[[-wë]]''. However it is said also to be a version of the [[Valarin]] name '''Mānawenūz''', which was the original [[Valarin]] name for Manwë. It meant ""Blessed One, One (closest) in accord with Eru"".<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

==Other names==
'''''Súlimo''''' was a Quenya epithet meaning ""Lord of the Breath of Arda"",<ref name=""vala"" /> literally ""Breather"".<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> The [[Sindarin]] form was probably ''Thû''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 124</ref> 

He bore the title of '''Elder King''',<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> '''''Aran Einior''''' in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 358</ref> Similar titles were '''High King of Arda'''<ref>{{S|9}}</ref> or '''King of Arda'''.<ref>{{S|2}}</ref><ref>{{S|7}}</ref>

In [[Adûnaic]], his name was '''''Amân'''''.<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}, p. 376</ref>

From the same root, ''[[The Etymologies]]'' give another epithet, ''Kalamando'' (""Light Mando""), being the light counterpart of ''[[Mandos|Morimando]]'' (""Dark Mando"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""MBAD""</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Manwë is referred to as ''Wolcenfréa'', consisting of ''wolcen'' (""sky""; cf. [[Wikipedia:Modern English|Modern English]] ""[[Wikipedia:Welkin|welkin]]"") + ''fréa'' (""ruler"").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 208</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an early manuscript called ""Valar name-list"", Manwë has the additional [[Qenya]] names ''Taimo'' (masculine form of ''Taime'', ""the sky"") and ''Valtur'' (""King of the Valar"").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 12</ref> Together with his wife, he was called '''''[[Wanwavoisi]]'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Súlimo""</ref>

His [[Gnomish]] names were '''''Man''''' and '''''Manweg'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Manwë""</ref>

==Inspiration==
Compared to real mythologies, Manwë represents possibly a [[Wikipedia:sky father|sky father]] like [[Wikipedia:Zeus|Zeus/Jupiter]] of the Greco-Roman mythology. Like Zeus, Manwë is both a [[Wikipedia:Sky deity|sky ""deity""]] and a [[Wikipedia:King of the Gods|leader of his pantheon]] and is associated with the [[eagle]].

{{familytree/end}}

==Etymology==
''Nessa'' ({{IPA|[ˈnesːa]}}) is a [[Quenya]] word meaning ""young""; in the same text, Nessa has also the name '''[[Indis]]''' ""bride"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 376-7</ref><ref>{{PE|14}}</ref>{{rp|14}} 

The [[Noldorin]] names of Nessa were '''''Neth''''' (a cognate of the Quenya/[[Qenya]] word) or '''''Dineth''''', a Noldorin word meaning ""bride"", related to the Quenya word ''indis''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry NI1</ref>

In a later text, [[Pengolodh]] notes that Nessa's name is ""not [[elvish]]"" and probably represents a [[Valarin]] title, much like the name of her spouse, adopted in Quenya, but there is no record.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Nessa was one of the [[Valarindi]], daughter of [[Aulë]] and [[Yavanna]]. Her son with Tulkas was [[Telimektar]].

Nessa was seen at the [[house of Tulkas]] bringing goblets of wine and drinks to his champions.<ref name=""Coming"" />{{rp|75}}

Nessa loved to retire to the green swards which her brother, [[Oromë]], had cultivated from the richness of his forest.<ref name=""Coming"" />{{rp|75}} When creating the forests of Oromë, [[Yavanna]] had planted forest glades with spells so that the glades would always remain green and smooth. Nessa, along with her maidens, would dance there as long as [[Laurelin]] was in bloom, and she was said to be an even better dancer than [[Vána]].<ref name=""Coming"">{{LT1|III}}</ref>

===Early etymology===
Her other names in [[Qenya]] were '''''Helinyetille''''' meaning ""Eyes of Heartsease"", from ''helin'' (""violet, pansy""), and '''''Melesta''''', from ''mele'' (""to love"").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

'''Nienna''' was a Queen of the [[Valar]], the sister of [[Mandos]] and [[Irmo]], acquainted with grief and sorrow but also pity and courage.

==Attributes==
The sister of the [[Fëanturi]], she is ranked as one of the eight [[Aratar]], the most powerful of the Valar. Her element is grief and she is ever mourning for the wounds of the world by evil. Those who listen to her learn wisdom and endurance in grief.<ref name=SIIb>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

Her [[Halls of Nienna|halls]] are in the distant west, close to the [[Halls of Mandos]], but on the western borders of the World, and her windows look outward from the [[Walls of the World]]. She dwells alone and rarely travels to the joyful city of [[Valmar]]. She goes more often to the halls of her brother [[Mandos]] to comfort and counsel those in the [[Halls of Waiting]] who cry to her.<ref name=SIIb/>

All that is known about her appearance is that she wears a grey hood.<ref name=S9>{{S|9}}: ""cast back her grey hood""</ref>

==History==
Her part in the [[Music of the Ainur]] was one of deep sadness, and from this grief entered the world in its beginning.<ref name=SIIb/>

The [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Gandalf#Names|Olórin]], who was later to travel to [[Middle-earth]] as [[Gandalf]], learned much from her.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

Nienna played a part in the making of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]; she wept on the mound of [[Ezellohar]], watering it with her tears.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> After the destruction of the Trees by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], she once again wept on their wounded remains, cleansing the filth of [[Ungoliant]], and helping to bring forth the last fruit and flower that were to become the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]].<ref name=S9/>

The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he wrought in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his part.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

''Nienna'' is a [[Quenya]] name which contains the word ''nie'' (""tear"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""NEI""</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', some early names of Nienna were:

'''Tulkas''' was a [[Valar|Vala]]. He was the most warlike of the Valar and the spouse of [[Nessa]].

==Attributes==
Tulkas was so strong and quick that he needed no weapon or steed. He delighted in deeds of prowess and strength such as wrestling and fighting. But he was not dreadful; he laughed loudly in sport and war and his anger dispelled [[darkness]] and clouds.<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIb}}</ref><ref name=""s1"">{{S|1}}</ref> 

He was a hardy friend and slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive. He was however not forward-thinking and did not learn from the past; always quick in action, he was not good in counselling.<ref name=""vala"" /><ref name=""Quenta"">{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|206}}

His flesh was ruddy and his hair and beard golden.<ref name=""vala"" />

Tulkas represents the good side of ‘violence’ in the war against evil. This is an absence of all compromise which will even face apparent evils (such as war) rather than parley; and does not (in any kind of pride) think that any one less than Eru can redress this, or rewrite the tale of Arda.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}</ref>{{rp|522}}

==History==
Tulkas was [[Creation of the Ainur|created]] by [[Eru]] with the other [[Ainur]] and sang in the [[Song of the Ainur]], and chose to enter [[Eä]]. His spirit was wandering Ea and did not participate in the formation of [[Arda]] with the other [[Valar]]: He heard of their [[First War]] with [[Melkor]] [[Valian Year 1500|1500]] [[Valian Years]] after their arrival, and descended to them from the far heavens. The Dark Lord might have defeated the Valar by himself, but hearing the sound of Tulkas' laughter and beholding his wrath, Melkor fled before him.<ref name=""s1"" /> 

Thanks to him, the Valar now continued their work in peace, and the [[Spring of Arda]] was begun. After the [[Two Lamps]] were erected and the Valar had made their first dwelling at [[Almaren]], Tulkas wedded [[Nessa]] in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had come, and ruined the Lamps, causing a cataclysm.<ref name=""s1"" />
[[File:Antonio Vinci - Tulkas.jpg|thumb|left|''Tulkas'' by [[:Category:Images by Antonio Vinci|Antonio Vinci]]]]
After the cataclysm, the Valar and their people went to [[Valinor]]. Anticipating the [[Awakening of the Elves]] he urged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor.

But when [[Oromë]] announced that the [[Elves|first Children of Ilúvatar]] did awake, Manwë called a council at the [[Ring of Doom]] and announced the will of Eru that, for the sake of the Elves, the Valar should regain guardianship of the world from Melkor. Tulkas was glad of this decision. In the [[Battle of the Powers]], after a long siege at [[Utumno]], it was Tulkas who wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face. Tulkas [[Chaining of Melkor|chained]] Melkor with the enchanted chain [[Angainor]], forged by [[Aulë]]. For a while the world was free from Melkor's influence.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>

When his sentence was fulfilled, Melkor repented of his actions and was pardoned by [[Manwë]]; Tulkas was disappointed with this decision, ever distrustful. But having fought Melkor in the name of authority, he could not rebel himself, and accepted Manwë's decision.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

After the lies spread by Melkor were known, Tulkas and Oromë seached him in the north of Aman, but he was already escaped south. And when Melkor and [[Ungoliant]] caused the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Tulkas and Oromë searched in vain for them, unable to penetrate the unlight cast by Ungoliant.<ref>{{S|8}}</ref> Shortly after, Tulkas hurried [[Fëanor]] to take a decision about surrendering the [[Silmarils]].<ref>{{S|9}}</ref>

It is said that in the [[Dagor Dagorath]], Tulkas will once more oppose [[Melkor]], and will directly fight him in the battle. The victor is unknown, But probably Melkor, For it will be [[Túrin]] who will slay Melkor.<ref name=""Quenta"">{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|333}}

{{Quote|All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar""}}

'''Vána''', one of the [[Valier]], was the younger sister of [[Yavanna]] and the spouse of [[Oromë]]. Among the seven Valier, Vána was the sixth named.<ref name=Valar/> 

==History==
Like her sister, Vána had influence with the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, ""all flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.""<ref name=Valar>{{S|IIb}}</ref> She had ""the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works.""<ref>{{MR|P3I1}}</ref>

[[Nessa]], the sister of Vána's spouse [[Oromë]], wedded [[Tulkas]] on the [[Almaren|Isle of Almaren]], the Valar's first dwelling. Vána robed Nessa with her flowers for the wedding.<ref>{{MR|P2}}</ref>

Vána dwelt in gardens filled with golden flowers and often came to the forests of Oromë. In the days of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]], the [[Maia]] maiden, [[Arien]], ""tended to the golden flowers of the gardens of Vána by watering them with the bright dews from [[Laurelin]]"".<ref>{{S|11}}</ref> [[Melian]] was another Maia who initially served Vána and [[Estë]] before she departed to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Vána'' is [[Quenya]] for ""beautiful"", from [[root]] [[BAN]], related to unmarred beauty.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 150</ref> She was also called the '''Ever-young'''.<ref name=Valar/>

{{familytree/end}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
In the earliest form of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', she and [[Oromë]] had a daughter, [[Nielíqui]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, entry ""Nielíqui""</ref> Whilst in the origins of the story of the [[Two Trees]], Vána played a formative role in the growth of [[Laurelin]]:
{{blockquote|Then was the pit covered with rich earths that [[Palúrien]] devised, and Vána came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that [[Ulmo]] had brought from the spilled lakes--yet was ''[[Kulullin]]'' almost o'erflowing at the end.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 71</ref>}}

Later, when the power of Palúrien had failed to heal the wounds of the [[Two Trees]], Vána's love for [[Laurelin]] was so great that it caused the tree's remaining life to come forth one last time as a fruit of gold from which the [[Valar]] later fashioned the [[Sun]]. Vána's maiden, [[Arien|Urwen]], would steer the Sun's vessel across the sky. Vána, who repented of speaking against the harvest of Laurelin's last fruit, cut her hair short to weave the tresses as the sails for the Sun-ship. Among other names, the Sun was called ""the Lamp of Vána"" in memory of her tears and the hair she offered.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 186</ref>

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the [[Exile of the Noldor|flight of the Noldoli]] to the [[Great Lands]], most of the [[Valar]] were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumours of [[Melko]] and his violence nor the murmur of the restless [[Noldoli]] to disturb them again. For such reasons, they sought the concealment and protection of their land [[Aman]]. It was said that particularly Vána and [[Nessa]] were of one mind in this matter, in accordance with most of the other Valar.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, pp. 208-209</ref>

===Later versions===
As Tolkien's works evolved, Vána's role was reduced, so in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' she does not interfere in the tale of the Sun and Moon, Nienna's tears being what cleansed the trees and Yavanna's songs what brought forth the final bloom of Telperion and fruit of Laurelin.

{{Quote|She is the lover of all things that grow in the earth, and all their countless forms she holds in her mind, from the trees like towers in forests long ago to the moss upon stones or the small and secret things in the mould.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar""}}

'''Yavanna Kementári''' was a [[Valar|Valië]], the Queen of [[Kemen|Earth]]. Also known as Giver of Fruits, she was responsible for all growing things.

==Attributes==
Yavanna was one of the [[Aratar]] and was next to [[Varda]] in reverence. She was the elder ""sister"" of [[Vána]] and the spouse of [[Aulë]]. She was responsible for all things that grew in the earth, from the moss on the rocks to the tallest trees.  

Her usual form was that of a tall woman robed in green. She has also been seen in the form of a tall tree growing from the waters of [[Ulmo]] to the winds of [[Manwë]] spilling golden dew from her branches, which made the barren earth green with corn.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>  

[[Melian]] of the [[Maiar]] was of her kin.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Jacek Kopalski - Yavanna's Trees.jpg|thumb|left|''Yavanna's Trees'' by [[:Category:Images by Jacek Kopalski|Jacek Kopalski]]]]
In the [[Song of the Ainur]] Yavanna sung of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of [[Manwë]] and [[Ulmo]], and some trees sang to [[Ilúvatar]]. This is said to be the conception of the [[Shepherds of the Trees]]. Her thought also met with Manwë's, setting the arrival of the [[Great Eagles]].<ref name=aule/>

In the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of [[Arda]] and watched over the [[olvar]] and all growing things. As [[Morgoth]] was corrupting her beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the plans against him.  After his expulsion from [[Arda]] she planted the seeds that she had long devised and life came to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Spring of Arda]], although in the beginning no flowers bloomed.<ref name=""Days"">{{S|Days}}</ref>  When the [[Two Lamps]] were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered in the [[Sleep of Yavanna]]<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> that lasted until the rising of the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]].<ref name=""Sun"">{{S|Sun}}</ref>

After the destruction of the [[Two Lamps]] the Valar withdrew to [[Aman]] and created [[Valinor]].  Upon the green mound of [[Ezellohar]] Yavanna sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened.  Her song, with the aid of the tears of [[Nienna]] brought forth the [[Two Trees]], her greatest creation, which gave light to the land.  However, Yavanna did not forsake the [[Outer Lands]]; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the [[Awakening of the Elves]].<ref name=""Days""/>

After [[Ilúvatar]] allowed Aulë's creations, the [[Dwarves]], to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in [[Middle-earth]]. [[Aulë]], in reply, told her that even [[Elves]] and [[Men]], the true [[Children of Ilúvatar]] would have need of her trees as well.  Yavanna lamented to [[Manwë]], questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others.  Manwë brought her concerns before [[Ilúvatar]] in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the [[Ents]] to protect the trees.<ref name=aule>{{S|Aule}}</ref>

When the Elves built [[Tirion]] upon [[Tol Eressëa]] Yavanna fashioned the tree [[Galathilion]], a lesser image of [[Telperion]], for the court beneath the [[Mindon]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

After the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the [[Silmarils]] she could heal them. For Yavanna confessed that even as a Valar, who are mighty under Eru, she could never conjure the same light again in this world. [[Fëanor]]<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> refused to give up the Silmarils, although Morgoth had already taken them when he made this decision.   Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from [[Laurelin]].  She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]].<ref name=""Sun""/>

For the [[Men]] who had stood with the Valar in the [[War of Wrath]] the land of [[Andor]] was raised by [[Ossë]], established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. When the [[Edain]] came to this island they created the realm of [[Númenor]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send [[Wizards|emissaries]] to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia [[Curumo]] to take her servant, [[Aiwendil]], with him.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Yavanna'' means ""Giver of Fruits"" in [[Quenya]]. The name is a compound of ''[[yávë]]'' (""fruit"") and ''[[anna]]'' (""gift""). Her epithet ''Kementári'' means ""Queen of the Earth"".<ref name=vala/>

Her [[Sindarin]] name appears to be '''''Ivon''''', only attested in the compound ''[[Yavannildi|Ivonwin]]'' (""Maidens of Yavanna"").<ref group=note>The name ''Ivon'' (variant form ''Ifon'') was also the [[Gnomish]] form of [[Qenya]] ''Yavanna''. Cf. {{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 273.</ref> Another form is '''''Ivann''''',<ref>{{PM|XV}}, pp. 404-5, where it is glossed as [[Noldorin]]</ref> also seen in the Sindarin month-name ''[[Ivanneth]]'' (Quenya: ''[[Yavannië]]'').

{{quote|[Saruman] is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making...|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Shadow of the Past]]""}}

'''Saruman the White''' was the first of the order of [[Wizards]] (or ''[[Istari]]'') who came to [[Middle-earth]] as Emissaries of the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. For a time he was the chief of the Wizards, as well as the head of the [[White Council]]. However, through his appreciation of [[Sauron]]'s innate strength, his envy of [[Gandalf]] and his overbearing hubris, the White Wizard fell into mimicry of the [[Dark Lord]] as his capable yet faithless servant, plotting to share in his power or to two-facedly seize the [[One Ring]] first. 

Both at Sauron's whim and for his own ambitions, Saruman coordinated assaults from his [[Orthanc]] tower in [[Isengard]] against the realm of [[Rohan]] during the [[War of the Ring]], while sapping the kingdom through his agent Gríma. However, the corrupted Wizard's legions were vanquished and he was forced to remain a prisoner in his own tower, though not for long. Allowed to leave Orthanc, he travelled to the [[Shire]], which his outlaw pawns had gained control over, and became the hidden local thug lord. Saruman was again defeated by the rallied, oppressed Hobbits and he himself was backstabbed by Gríma for his mistreatment. His unbodied spirit was denied the [[West]] and fled naked and impotent, a fate not unlike that of Sauron.

==History==
===Early history===
As a [[Maia]], Saruman was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=""Ainu"">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> In his early days in [[Valinor]], he went by the name ''[[Curumo]]''<ref name=""Istari6"">{{UT|13a}}, note 6, p. 401</ref> or ''Tarindor''.<ref name=""Cuv"" /> Like Sauron, he was a powerful Maia of [[Aulë]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref>

After the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Tarindor was one of the [[Five Guardians]] sent to protect the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref name=""Cuv"">{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]].

===Return to Middle-earth===
After the defeat of Morgoth, the Valar grew concerned about the rising power of Sauron in Middle-earth. In Valinor, a council was called by [[Manwë]], where it was decided to send Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth to help the [[Free Peoples]] challenge Sauron. The council likely met in the middle of the Second Age, shortly after the creation of the [[Rings of Power]]. The council determined that these emissaries (who became known as the Istari or Wizards) should be ""mighty, peers of Sauron, yet [they should] forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men.""<ref name=""Istari"">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>{{rp|393}} Curumo, who was sent to the council by Aulë, volunteered to travel to Middle-earth as an emissary; he was appointed the first Istar and became the chief of their Order.<ref name=""Istari"" />{{rp|389, 394}}

Even before arriving in Middle-earth, Curumo begrudged his peers among the Istari. ''[[Gandalf|Olórin]]'' (later called Gandalf), who did not wish to travel to Middle-earth, was commanded by Manwë to go as the third Istar. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf began here, when [[Varda]] said of Gandalf that he was ""not the third"". Saruman was charged to take [[Aiwendil]] (later called Radagast) with him to please [[Yavanna]], which he did not wish to do, and this led to his contempt for the latter Wizard.<ref name=""Istari"" />{{rp|393}}

In Middle-earth, Curomo became known in [[Sindarin]] as ''[[Curunír]]'' and in [[Westron]] by his most common name, ''Saruman''. Like the other Wizards, his [[fana]] took the appearance of an old man. He had raven hair and was robed in white.<ref name=""Istari"" />{{rp|393}}

Saruman and others of the Istari arrived in Middle-earth on a ship at [[Mithlond]] (the [[Grey Havens]]) in [[Lindon]] around the year 1000 of the Third Age.<ref name=""Istari"" /> At the time of their arrival, their origin, nature, purpose, and true names were a secret to nearly everyone in Middle-earth. Having witnessed their arrival, [[Círdan]] alone knew the truth of their identity and origin. He chose to give [[Narya]], the Red Ring, to Gandalf to aid him in his mission.<ref name=""AppTA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> Círdan told only [[Galadriel]] and [[Elrond]] of the true origins of the Istari.<ref name=""SV"" /> After a time, Saruman learned of Círdan's gift and begrudged it; this heightened the hidden ill-will that he bore towards Gandalf.<ref name=""Istari"" />

Shortly after arriving, Saruman travelled into the [[East]] of Middle-earth, as did the two [[Blue Wizards]]. After one and a half millennia he returned to the West, just as Sauron's power was growing again in [[Dol Guldur]].

===Chief of the White Council===
[[File:Angus McBride - Saruman.gif|thumb|''Saruman'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
When the White Council was formed around {{TA|2463}},<ref name=""AppTA"" /> Saruman was appointed its leader despite Galadriel's wishes that Gandalf be leader. Even then, he had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially his One Ring. Coincidentally, in that same year, the One Ring was found by the creature [[Gollum]],<ref name=""AppTA"" /> drawing the Dark Lord closer to the conflict that would eventually prove Saruman's undoing.

During this period, Saruman spent years in [[Minas Tirith]] examining its archives. It is possible that there he surmised that a [[Palantíri|''palantír'']] would still be located in Orthanc, the tower of Isengard.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> He offered to make Isengard his home and to command the defences of the West. This was welcomed by King [[Fréaláf]] of Rohan and [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] of [[Gondor]] alike. In {{TA|2759}}, Saruman was given the [[Key of Orthanc]] in the ring of Isengard his abode, hoping that he would prove an important ally.<ref name=""SV"">{{S|V}}</ref><ref name=""stew"">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> There he became important in the defence of the free lands of the West. In Orthanc he came upon the [[Orthanc-stone]], one of the seven seeing stones, but kept it secret and hidden, particularly from the White Council.<ref name=""AppEorl"" /> He would later betray the Council by concealing his use of it. 

In {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met and Gandalf revealed that the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron and that he had returned, and urged an attack there. Saruman however believed that Sauron would be useful in his quest: allowing Sauron to build up his strength, the One Ring would reveal itself, and Saruman hoped to have sufficient strength to seize it first himself until that event. With this strategy in mind, Saruman overruled Gandalf. It soon became clear that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring himself.<ref name=""c250"">{{FR|Council}} p. 250-51</ref>

He soon found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in {{TA|2941}} he finally consented to an [[Attack on Dol Guldur]] against Sauron at which point Sauron retreated to [[Mordor]].<ref name=""AppTA"" /><ref name=""c250"" />
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
In {{TA|2953}}, the [[Wise]] gathered once more to debate about the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted the Council claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost forever in the [[Belegaer]]. Following their final meeting (and the death of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Turgon]]), Saruman took Isengard for his own and fortified it.<ref name=""stew"" /> Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; thus he discovered the existence of the Shire and noted Gandalf's interest in it, and started sending agents in [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name=""AppTA"" /> As [[Lord of Isengard]], Saruman began to bring trouble to Rohan by aiding its enemies.<ref name=""AppEorl"">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> But the Wise were already suspicious about him; [[Aragorn]] tried to advise Steward [[Ecthelion II]] not to trust Saruman for his help against Sauron.<ref name=""stew"" />

Sauron had declared himself openly in Mordor; he established contact with Saruman through the [[Ithil-stone]] his minions had captured from [[Minas Ithil]]. Through his jealousy towards Gandalf and his ever-growing pride and arrogance, and through the use of the ''palantír'', Saruman was ensnared by Sauron. Using either the knowledge of his new ally or lore of lost [[Eregion]], Saruman crafted his own lesser ring and sought to emulate Sauron. His corruption was complete around {{TA|3000}}.<ref name=""AppTA"" /> The Wizard intended to share in the Dark Lord's power one way or another; he would aid in Sauron's victory to win his approval and become his equal lieutenant, or cheat him and try to supplant him by acquiring the One Ring for himself. 

===War of the Ring===
At about this time, in an attempt to control Rohan, Saruman bought the allegiance of King [[Théoden]]'s chief advisor, [[Gríma]], who then counselled the ailing king to do nothing about the steady resurgence of Sauron's armies. Saruman and Gríma's treachery would have crippled Rohan's military might and allowed Sauron lordship of the kingdom, had not Gandalf interfered a year later and revealed to Théoden his right-hand man's true designs, healing the old king and revitalising his political and military rule.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>

He had sent spies to negotiate the purchase of [[pipe-weed]] from the Shire, in preparation for the war, and also learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding out who possessed the One Ring.<ref name=""UT10"">{{UT|10}}, ""Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire""</ref> 

Saruman did not reveal his true intentions until Gandalf presented him with the discovery and location of the One Ring. On [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard.<ref name=""AppGreat"">{{App|Great}}</ref> Saruman demanded that Gandalf submit to him or to Sauron. Saruman then stood forth as [[Many Colours|Saruman of Many Colours]], and when Gandalf refused to join his new Lord or tell him of the Ring, he held him captive in Isengard. 

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Gríma and Saruman.jpg|thumb|left|Saruman commanding his forces from Orthanc as seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' film]]

It must have been during Gandalf's captivity in Orthanc that Saruman began to assemble his following of [[Orcs]], [[Dunlendings]] and [[Uruk-hai]] into a massive army, since Gandalf came to an as yet undestroyed Isengard. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Saruman was gathering his hordes of Orcs and [[Wolves]] in his pits and forges, both in service and in competition with Sauron.<ref name=""FRCouncil"">{{FR|Council}}</ref> One can speculate that if matters had developed a little more slowly, his puppet Gríma would have gained full control over Rohan, and the [[Rohirrim]] would have been enslaved or destroyed.

Gandalf later escaped, and so Saruman's treachery and professed allegiance to Sauron became known to the rest of the White Council when Gandalf reported this during the subsequent [[Council of Elrond]].<ref name=""FRCouncil"" />

Saruman soon also betrayed his master, Sauron, by lying to the [[Witch-king]] when he arrived at Isengard. Sauron had sent the [[Nazgûl]] searching for [[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]], who had found the One Ring years before, and the Shire, his home. Saruman pretended to know nothing about the Shire. But the Lord of Minas Morgul and his company did not have the strength to assault the Ring of Isengard. Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring, and the Nazgûl departed.<ref name=""UTHunt"" />

In September of {{TA|3018}}, the Nazgûl captured one of his Shire [[Squint-eyed southerner|spies]] who told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying Saruman, and exposing the Wizard's double treachery. They also seized some maps and information about the Shire and [[Baggins]].<ref name=""UT10"" /> Perceived as a turncoat by the Free Peoples and fearing being caught as an unfaithful vassal of Mordor, Saruman put all efforts into reassuring Sauron of his commitment or obtaining the One Ring for himself.<ref name=""UTHunt"">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

The failure to capture the Ring at [[Emyn Muil]] further ruined Saruman's plans, as he was revealed as a certain traitor to Sauron as well.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Wrath of the Ents.jpg|thumb|''The Wrath of the Ents'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Finding himself in a precarious position, Saruman could only hope to acquire the Ring or convince Sauron of his loyalty. Therefore he implemented an aggressive strategy of attacking Rohan, endeavouring to kill the King's son [[Théodred]], sending spies to waylay [[Frodo Baggins]] on his flight from the Shire, and dispatching raiding parties on likely routes a company of the Ring might take to Gondor. Ironically, one of these parties captured [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and transported them to [[Fangorn Forest]] in time to mobilise the [[Ents]]. Gandalf also suspected Saruman had found (and destroyed) the remains of [[Isildur]], who had worn the Ring before it had been lost.

Saruman's Shire network failed to capture Frodo Baggins, Gandalf rallied Rohan to victory, [[Éomer]] stopped his brutal, but only partially successful raiding party, and control of Isengard was lost to the Ents. Aware he was utterly defeated, Saruman briefly considered repenting for his deeds, but at the last moment could not go through with it. Whether he had hope he could escape, whether he was too proud to surrender to Gandalf, or whether he thought his master would pardon him, Saruman refused to leave the confines of his fortress. Saruman made a final attempt to woo Théoden and Gandalf to his cause but failed: his staff was broken and he was expelled from the Order of the Istari.

Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring and unable to be of any use to Sauron, he eventually managed to convince his captors, the Ents, to let him leave Isengard, as apparently the magic of his voice still remained.

[[File:Valera Lutfullina - Nasty End.jpg|thumb|200px|right|""Nasty End"" by [[:Category:Art by Valera Lutfullina|Valera Lutfullina]]]]

On their way to northern [[Dunland]], on [[28 August]]<ref name=""chief"">{{App|Chief}}</ref> they were confronted by Gandalf, [[Celeborn]], Galadriel and the Hobbits, but they passed as travelling beggars as Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, and he exclaimed how he hated his lord. Gandalf told Gríma that he was free to leave him but he did not reply. As Saruman was considered powerless, there was little concern for his escape.<ref name=""Partings"">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> On [[22 September]]<ref name=""chief"" /> they entered to the Shire, which his ally [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] (undisturbed by events elsewhere) had brought under control. He established himself in [[Hobbiton]] and spent his final days as a small-time thug lord whom his [[ruffians]] called Sharkey, imposing a terror regime to avenge himself upon the peaceful Halflings. But even this operation fell apart after Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] returned; he was eventually betrayed and killed by his own agent Gríma on [[3 November]], {{TA|3019}}.

Saruman, who was a Maia, had lost his shape with his ""death"". As a discorporate spirit, he turned westward, but a wind came from the [[West]] and pushed him away. Apparently his spirit was left naked, powerless, and wandering in Middle-earth, not unlike Sauron after the One Ring was destroyed.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Curunír.jpg|thumb|''Curunír'' by [[:Category:Images by Gregor Roffalski|Gregor Roffalski]]]]
In appearance, Saruman was as an old man with black hair. At the end of the Third Age, his hair and beard had turned mostly white — he had only black hairs about his lips and ears. He was tall, his face was long, and his eyes were deep and dark. He would appear in a white cloak, a habit he later changed into a cloak that changed colours as he moved.

He was not actually a [[Men|Man]], or even an Elf (as Men often suspected), but a Maia clothed in flesh — an Istar (see ''Origins'' above). As such, he was immortal and extremely powerful, yet had limits on how far these powers could be used. His two most salient powers were his knowledge and his voice. Saruman was, in a very real way, the junior brother of Sauron both having been Maia of Aulë, Valar of Smithcraft, in the very beginnings of time. The parallels between Sauron and Saruman in both character and actions are many.

===Powers===
Knowledge of the ""deep arts"" (or magic, such as it is in Middle-earth) was of particular interest to Saruman, especially when relating to power such as the Rings of Power and the far-seeing ''palantíri''. He was also deeply learned in ancient lore regarding powerful kingdoms such as [[Númenor]], [[Gondor]], and [[Moria]]. 

His voice and speech were extremely convincing, more powerful than mere rhetoric. When he focused this power on a person or a group of people, he could sway their hearts, plant fears and sow lies as he pleased. According to the stature of the listener, this spell could last as long as the speech did, or it could take root in them and last forever. Saruman's voice was so powerful that he was able to convince the Witch-king that he knew nothing of the One-Ring or the Shire. His voice was not hypnotic, however, rather it was persuasive; and the real danger the voice posed to the listener was not them falling into a trance, but agreeing with it.<ref name=""Voice"" />

Aside from his voice, Saruman has other subtle abilities such as giving great speed and motivation to his orcs at a distance and setting his will against all those in his dominion that might oppose him. Aragorn takes note of this ability while tracking the party of orcs holding Merry and Pippin hostage. Saruman also seems to be able to move around totally unheard by others, as there are numerous examples of him using this ability. Several examples include his sneaking up on Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]'s camp in [[The Riders of Rohan]], his wholly unheard entrance in [[The Voice of Saruman]] and his quiet but sudden appearance to the hobbits in [[The Scouring of the Shire]]. 

Other powers include knowledge of machinery and chemistry, probably separable from explicit magic (for instance, the ""blasting fire"" employed by his Uruk-hai army in the battle of [[Helm's Deep]], was some kind of chemical explosive). Machinery and engines characterised both his fortified Isengard and his altered Shire arenas of influence. In this, he sought to emulate, or even surpass his ally, Sauron. This inclination was constitutional in them both from the very beginning.

His science also extended to biological areas. He is believed to have crossbred Men and Orcs, creating a new race of Orcs unafraid of daylight, the dreaded Uruk-hai, a major improvement on Sauron's thralls who hated daylight. His mannish spies in Bree were said to have Orc blood, giving them heightened senses over ordinary men. He also employed scavenger birds in his service, although this might also be attributed to [[Radagast]] the Brown, ordering them to report to Orthanc, Saruman's stronghold.

Being regarded as more powerful than Gandalf (at least before Gandalf's ""rebirth""), it's fair to assume he would also wield explicit magic similar to Gandalf, such as artificial light, locking spells, creating fire, etc.

Saruman, walking on the same ruinous path as Sauron, attempted to forge for himself a Ring of Power. This he wore during the War of the Ring which he revealed when he called himself ""Saruman the [[Ring-maker]]"".<ref name=""FRCouncil"" /> He had great knowledge and lore of the magic rings created by Sauron and by the Elven-smiths, though at this time the full art of ring-making was lost and known only to Sauron and so Saruman's knowledge of the craft was incomplete. It is assumed that Saruman's Ring was the equivalent of one of the lesser rings in power and any details of this power are not mentioned. It is also assumed that it too lost its power, if it had any, when the One Ring was destroyed, since Saruman's craft of ring-making was still based on Sauron's. When Gandalf was given Narya, the Ring of Fire, Saruman learned of the gift and resented it. This may be another reason why Saruman desired to have a ring of his own.

===Personality===
Saruman resembled Gandalf not only in appearance, but originally also somewhat in deportment, but unlike Gandalf, Saruman was proud, even haughty, and in this he was more akin to Sauron. He saw himself as the most powerful of the Istari, expressing clear contempt for Radagast the Brown, patronising tolerance of the Wise and Elves, and sheer disdain for lesser Men. Saruman was no fool (though he saw Radagast as one); he realised Gandalf's power, and eventually came to see him as an equal, and later as a superior, much to his distress. He became jealous of Gandalf, eventually convincing himself that Gandalf was scheming against him, which justified his own scheming against Gandalf and the rest of the White Council, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as well. Saruman's ultimate agenda, in the end, was not very different at all from Sauron's, in that he himself ultimately sought to become a tyrant of Middle-earth; regardless if by his new master's side or (more preferably) on his own - if he attained the One Ring First. 

Saruman likely was true to his mission in the beginning, and actually believed in working to stop the return of the Darkness, but his pride and later arrogance (as well as his jealousy towards Gandalf and domination by Sauron) turned him into a traitor to the cause he had once served. Saruman's betrayal was not sudden, but slowly grew over time as Sauron used Saruman's lust for power, admiration of strength and envy as tools of control, until at last Saruman had convinced himself that he could not have taken any other path and that it was too late now to repent. To the last the corrupted Wizard only believed in his own counsel and the deceptive words of the Dark Lord. These false beliefs kept Saruman from taking his last chance at redemption, and because he must have realised this after Gandalf's truly generous terms he only became more bitter and filled with the rage of failure, blaming Gandalf more than anyone else for his downfall.

==Politics==
===Men===
Saruman ""went mostly among men"". He always sought power, and it lay in the hands of the kingdoms of Men.

No records speak of his earliest journeys into the east; after his return he became a servant of Gondor, receiving the keys to Orthanc from Beren as its warden. When Gondor weakened, he claimed Orthanc for his own without any formal declaration (or objection from Gondor), yet remained nominally an ally of Gondor and of Rohan.<ref name=""AppEorl"" /> 

When he turned to treachery, Saruman employed men mainly from Dunland, and agents from other lands, turning old grudges into fuel for new hatred. The Dunlendings were enticed with the old stories that they had once lived in [[Calenardhon]] before the ''Strawheads''. The Dunlendings became his soldiers and it also seems probable that he used some of them to create [[Half-orcs]].

Gríma Wormtongue played a vital role in Saruman's plans: with Saruman's counsel Gríma began to weaken the king, estranging him from his other counsellors and even his own kin, until Gríma had in effect become the leader of Rohan.

===Elves=== 
Saruman was once on good terms with the Elves, and was voted in as the leader of the White Council, a group of Elves and Istari united against Sauron. 

Saruman knew that Gandalf had been given the third Elvish ring Narya by Círdan the Shipwright. This nurtured his jealousy of Gandalf and his resentment towards the Elves. 

Saruman had little use for, or interest in, the Elves, who were declining and their lands were few and secretive; although they wielded marvellous powers and two Rings of Power, they were not useful nor accessible for Saruman's ambitions. Also, they succumbed less easily than other races to manipulation. 

Even though Isengard lay very close to [[Lothlórien]], Saruman had very little or no contact with it. Saruman never trusted Galadriel and he accused her of scheming for Gandalf at his expense.<ref name=""Partings"" />

===Orcs===
Saruman drew his original strength of Orcs from tribes in the [[Misty Mountains]], and perhaps from Moria Orcs. He made use of [[Wargs|Warg]]-mounted Orcs for raids against Rohan.

He also bred [[Orcs of Isengard|Orcs]] in the pits of Isengard, eventually creating crossbreeds of Orcs and Men (probably Dunlendings or [[Bree-men]]) This programme apparently also involved feeding these greater Orcs Man-flesh as a treat.

His Uruk-hai legions displayed great discipline and fierce loyalty, in addition to the other improvements such as height, strength, endurance and resistance to sunlight. There also appears to have been middle stages between Men and the Uruk-hai, Men with varying degrees of Orkish appearance such as [[Half-orcs]] and [[Goblin-men]]. These were reported by Pippin and Merry to have been part of Saruman's regular army, but were not Uruk-hai, since the hobbits would have recognised these from their earlier capture. 

Saruman's servants called him ""[[Sharkey]]"" both in Isengard and later in the Shire.<ref name=""Scouring"" />

===Ents/Trees===
Saruman made contact with the Ents in Fangorn Forest shortly after he settled in Isengard. The oldest of the Ents, [[Treebeard]] received him and gave him free access to the forest.<ref name=""Treebeard"">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>

Saruman also consulted with Treebeard, learning much old lore that the Ents would have remembered from ancient times. Saruman did not return this favour, but only listened.<ref name=""Treebeard"" />

The Ents saw Saruman's treachery early, and became very concerned, primarily with Saruman's Orcs felling trees on the edge of Fangorn for use in the furnaces of Isengard and sometimes for no reason at all. 

The Ents also appear to have had a sense of order, how things should be, that Saruman encroached upon. The crossbreeding of Men and Orcs particularly alarmed them, out of proportion to other concerns enemies of Saruman might have had. Also alarming was the pure fact of his treachery — the Istari were supposed to have a special responsibility. 

Saruman used the Ents and the Fangorn forest without concern for the consequences. He clearly misjudged the Ents' abilities and will to act. This might not have been as incautious as it seemed, since major contributing factors to the Ent's actions were advice and requests from Gandalf, and concern about the rising power of Sauron (and their wish to support the front-line troops of the war, Rohan and Gondor). 

Saruman clearly had the ability to understand the minds of the Ents when he found it useful. He managed to talk Treebeard into setting him free from Orthanc by pushing just the right buttons — Ents dislike the concept of caging up any creature.

===Hobbits===
The race of Hobbits and their lands seemed too insignificant to interest Saruman: until he took notice of Gandalf's special concern for them. Studying Gandalf made him focus gradually more and more on the Hobbits and The Shire. For a period he actually travelled there in secret, mapping out the lands. Gandalf was aware of this, but at this point only amused.

He began smoking pipe-weed (a habit of the Hobbits that Gandalf had picked up), also in secret. His demand for tobacco opened up trading between The Shire and Isengard, and the power his money could wield there and the corruption it could cause began to fascinate him. Some of his agents went in secret, and some were known to Gandalf and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]].

His anger towards the Hobbits may possibly stem from the attention Gandalf showed them. It certainly strengthened immensely when he discovered that the Hobbits had ""conspired"" with Gandalf to keep the One Ring from him.

This, and the sudden urgency caused by the Ringwraiths' hunt for the Ring-bearer from The Shire to Rivendell, made him increase his activity in the area, leading to a build-up of power that would lead to virtual conquest of The Shire. 

He might also later have blamed the ruin of Isengard by the Ents on Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, who clearly catalysed events. 

This all came together when Saruman escaped from the Ents and retired to The Shire and his thug regime in place there. It appears he immediately switched the focus of this operation to wanton destruction: pollution, murder, fire, chopping down trees for no reason, a last blow against Hobbits and Gandalf.

At his final utter defeat by [[Battle of Bywater|a Hobbit uprising]], his life was spared even when he tried to assassinate Frodo Baggins. At this moment he actually conceded a short-lived respect to Frodo.

===Valar/Maiar/Wizards=== 
Saruman was supposedly eager to go to Middle-earth, against Manwë's counsel. After his 'death' he was apparently barred from returning to Valinor, and therefore was denied reincarnation and condemned to waft away and disappear like so much smoke.<ref name=""Scouring"">{{FR|Scouring}}, p. 1020</ref> In his corrupt state, Saruman sought power and the imposing of order in Middle-earth by any means necessary, even if it meant betraying the mission he was entrusted with and throwing in his lot with Sauron.

Sauron, in origin a Maia of Aulë like Saruman, awed and frightened him. During the height of his arrogance, Saruman thought he could contend with Sauron, but in the end he found himself meddling with a spirit of far greater power and knowledge than himself. Caught peering into the ''palantír'' he was seduced by Sauron to his allegiance, no longer opposing (and perhaps even desiring) his victory. The Wizard sought to become the quasi-equal lieutenant to Sauron and receive his favour in triumph, yet he was proved to be a duplicitous ally by actively coveting the One Ring. After the Escape of Gandalf, Saruman understood the only paths ahead of him were to: show Sauron his loyalty by crippling Rohan, hoping to at the very least be spared, or claim the Ring first; otherwise he would come to ruin and torment. 

Saruman grudgingly brought with him Radagast as a companion from Valinor, at the request of Yavanna, yet still managed to arrive alone, and first. Shortly after, he went into the East with the two Blue Wizards, and later returned alone. There he may have wrought many great works to diminish the influence of the Enemy or searched for lore to help him in his schemes.

Radagast, even though Saruman scorned him, served both Gandalf and Saruman very usefully (and wholly unintentionally, as he admitted ""he had just the wit to play the part I set him"", that of persuading Gandalf to come to Isengard).<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 258</ref> Radagast also sent birds to Saruman and Gandalf to report the different happenings in Middle-earth. 

Saruman had always been jealous of Gandalf, and knew that he was keeping secrets from him, such as his suspicion about Bilbo's ring and Narya, secret. Gandalf also suspected Saruman of plotting to gain the One Ring for himself, and hinted at this at a meeting of the White Council. Gandalf blew nine small smoke rings and one great one that wavered a bit, seeming almost palpable, and yet blew away, symbolising (almost prophetic of) Saruman's failure in achieving the One. In general, Saruman must have viewed Gandalf as his only peer, and as such to be feared and treated with (although not necessarily shown) respect. He always kept a watchful eye open for Gandalf's doings, and actually picked up the habit of smoking pipe-weed by sending out spies tailing Gandalf to the Shire. After revealing his fealty to Mordor and his desire for the Ring, Saruman offered Gandalf the chance to join with Sauron, or perhaps get the One for themselves. Ultimately, certain that Gandalf could be forced to tell of the Ring's whereabouts or that at least Sauron would prevail, he came to underestimate Gandalf and think little of his interventions.

Nevertheless, Saruman exercised more power than Gandalf, even with the ring Narya, as became clear when he placed Gandalf under arrest at the pinnacle of Orthanc. The text does not make it clear whether Saruman lost power or whether Gandalf gained power, but when Gandalf returned as ""Gandalf [[the White]]"", he could summon Saruman at his will, forcibly keep him in his presence, and finally break Saruman's staff (with whatever implications that might have had for Saruman's powers). 

Despite his apparent disdain for the Grey Pilgrim, Saruman several times came very close to setting aside his pride and asking Gandalf for pity and help. The closest call came when the Ringwraiths (on their way to the Shire) arrived at Isengard while Gandalf still remained in captivity there. Saruman, realising he might have already lost Sauron's trust, actually went to seek Gandalf's pardon, only to find his erstwhile captive missing from the top of Orthanc.

===Animals===
Saruman had control over many birds, probably having been taught to tame them by Radagast. [[Crebain]] spied for him and brought him news.<ref>{{FR|South}}</ref> In addition, the Orcs Saruman took in his armies had amongst them wild [[Wolves]] and even [[Wargs]], a sort of demonic cousin of the former.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earlier versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Saruman was sketched merely as a fawning servant of [[Sauron]], while the army he musters is not in rivalry of [[Mordor]]'s but from the beginning in his new master's employ. In other drafts, the treacherous [[Wizards|Wizard]] hands [[Gandalf]] over to the evil [[Giants|Giant]] [[Treebeard]] or betrays him to the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]].<ref name=""FRCouncil"" />

Saruman's older names in these drafts were Sarumond and Saramund,<ref name=""rc"">{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiii</ref> containing the English term ''mund'' ""hand"".

==Inspiration==
Saruman was invented and introduced in the story in order to explain [[Gandalf]]'s absence in the first part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', replacing [[Treebeard]] as the [[Wizards|Wizard]]'s captor.<ref name=""rc"" />

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:[[Fraser Kerr]] provided the voice of Saruman. From early on in the production, it was decided that ""Saruman"" and ""[[Sauron]]"" sounded too much alike, and might confuse viewers. On concept art, Saruman is called Ruman,<ref>[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=69 1978 - The Lord of the Rings Gallery] at [http://www.ralphbakshi.com Ralphbakshi.com] (accessed 26 March 2011)</ref> but prior to recording, this was changed to Aruman. However, during recording, it was again changed, to ""Saruman"". Because of this late change, several instances of ""Aruman"" remain in the finished film.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Saruman was played by [[Christopher Lee]]. Saruman's depiction in the series is more akin to the early drafts: he is a more committed vassal of Sauron; still, he is seemingly not above cheating his master, instructing [[Lurtz]] to bring him the Hobbits carrying ""something of great value"" (the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]). In the films, his corruption by Sauron is directly portrayed to have come about through his use of one of the ''[[Palantíri]]'' found in the tower of [[Orthanc]], through which Sauron fueled the lust for power and accompanying arrogance and greed already festering in Saruman's heart. The films did not include the [[Scouring of the Shire]], so Saruman's last appearance was in [[Isengard]], during his encounter with [[Gandalf]] and Théoden. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of ''The Return of the King'']], [[Gríma]] stabs Saruman in the back, causing him to fall on a spiked wheel below the tower of Orthanc.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:''' Christopher Lee reprised his role as Saruman, although the character does not appear in the book.<ref name=""TelegraphCasting"">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8311016/Christopher-Lee-will-star-in-the-Hobbit-prequel.html|articlename=Christopher Lee will star in the Hobbit prequel|dated=08-Feb-2011|website=[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ The Telegraph]|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}</ref> He appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside Gandalf, [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]]. He is sceptical about the appearance of a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] in [[Dol Guldur]]. However, when he participates in the attack on Dol Guldur, he sees for himself that Sauron has indeed returned. After the skirmish, he appears shaken by the display of Sauron's power, but claims he will take it upon himself to keep an eye on the Dark Lord and pretends to care for Lady Galadriel's weakened state.

'''2024: ''[[The War of the Rohirrim]]'':''' Christopher Lee posthumously voices Saruman through an archival recording. Saruman appears at the end of the film, introduced to the newly crowned king, [[Fréaláf Hildeson]], as the newly appointed master of Isengard, and he assures Fréaláf that Rohan has Isengard's support.

===Television===
'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''
:Saruman was played by actor Mikko Kivinen. He appears only in the ""Vanha metsä"" (""Old Forest"") episode.

===Radio series===
'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[Robert Farquharson]].

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[James Arrington]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' 
:[[Peter Howell]] played Saruman. Because the series follows a chronological timeline rather than the flashbacks of the books, Saruman's betrayal is brought out much sooner than in the book. Excerpts from ""[[The Hunt for the Ring]]"" are dramatised to flesh out Gandalf's escape from Isengard, and the [[Nazgûl]]'s pursuit. The hobbits do not meet him on the road back to Rivendell. In the final episode, Saruman's death at the hands of Wormtongue at [[Bag End]] is included.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Saruman is played by Manfred Steffen.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by Andrej Hryc. Saruman appears in all three series (seasons) of this adaptation, with his most prominent appearances in the episodes covering ''The Two Towers''.

===Games===
'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Though Christopher Lee provided the voice of Saruman for many scenes, the only visual appearance of the Wizard of from re-used movie clips, his voice is played over several of Gandalf's actions.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Saruman is one of the ""Hero"" units of the Servants of Sauron, the game also depicts his creation of the Uruk-hai.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Saruman is the main ""Hero"" unit of the Isengard faction, the evil campaign follows his despoilment of both Isengard and the [[Fangorn Forest]], war on [[Rohan]] and later conquest of the outlying lands.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Saruman is still the main ""Hero"" unit of the Isengard faction but plays no role in the storyline.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard]]'':'''
:Though frequently referred to in-game since 2007, Saruman made no visual appearance until 2011 and the ''Rise of Isengard'' expansion. Many quests in the game display the stretch of the [[White Hand]] - Saruman's minions are present in the Shire as early as {{TA|3018}}, as well as [[Bree-land]], [[Lone-lands]], [[Eregion]], [[Enedwaith]], [[Dunland]], [[Gap of Rohan]], outskirts of the Fangorn Forest and even [[Moria]].
:In the storyline of ''Rise of Isengard'' Saruman first appears buying the loyalties of the [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] clans, bringing with him riches and maintaining a friendly appearance. He also still keeps his affairs in Rohan private, to the point that when a [[Rohirrim]] questions the desolation of [[Nan Curunír|''Nan Curunír'']] and the presence of [[Trolls]] in Isengard, the Wizard manages to use his voice to convince him that it was all for the good cause. At one point, traitorous Dunlendings capture the player and send him to Saruman as a gift - once again the Wizard maintains a friendly and noble appearance, trying to discern the location of The Ring, before the player escapes.
:A major storyline is derived from a single line in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', where Saruman calls himself ""Ring-forger"". Long having researched the [[Rings of Power]], Saruman sends his minions to pillage what remains of Ring-Forges of Eregion, looking for any knowledge of ancient [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain|Elven smiths]] that have remained here. Using that lore, he constructs a massive Ring-Forge under Isengard, where he creates five lesser rings and a master one to command them. He keeps the master ring to himself and gives the other to his most trusted lieutenants, though none of the mortals are prepared for it and are turned into monstrosities. A large force of players defeats them one by one, reclaiming lesser rings and later use those rings to turn upon the master one. In the ensuing fight Saruman's ring is destroyed shortly before the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Hornburg]], and with it the lesser ones lose their power.

'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''
:Voiced by [[Roger Jackson]], Saruman appears in this game as a non-playable character. The game's protagonist, [[Talion]], finds various artefacts that reveal that Saruman's spies are active within the borders of Mordor in the years between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is later revealed that Saruman was controlling Queen Marwen of the [[Nurnen]] to hinder Sauron while bringing about the destruction of the men of [[Nurn]].

'''Beren''' ([[Third Age]] 2655<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> – 2763,<ref name=""South"">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 108 years) was the nineteenth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].
==History==
Beren succeeded his father [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Egalmoth]] at his death in {{TA|2743}}.<ref name=""South""/> 

Beren spent much of his rule fighting the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] for the [[Outlands|coasts]] were assailed by three great fleets from [[Umbar]] and from [[Harad]] up to the mouth of [[Isen]]. During the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758}} - {{TA|2759|n}}, [[Rohan]] came under attack from the [[Dunlendings]], but as both nations were under attack neither could help each other. Before spring his son [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|Beregond]] overcame the invaders and was able to send help to Rohan and  fulfill the [[Oath of Eorl]].

After the wars, [[Saruman]] suddenly appeared and requested leave to dwell in [[Isengard]], and Beren gladly gave the [[Wizard]] the [[key of Orthanc]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Beregond followed Beren at his death in {{TA|2763|n}}.<ref name=""South""/>

'''Eradan''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1999|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 204</ref> – {{TA|2116|n}},<ref name=""South"">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 117 years) was the second [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Eradan was the heir to [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], the first Steward to rule in Gondor. Unlike his ancestors, he and his descendants took a [[Sindarin]] name. He ruled for thirty-six years and was succeeded by his son [[Herion]].<ref name=""South""/>

==Etymology==
''Eradan'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack and David Salo suggest it means ""single man"" and is a compound of ''[[er]]'' (""one"", ""alone"") and ''[[adan]]'' (""man"" [as a race]).<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3436731679.html|articlename=S.

Although the name refers to her hair, it is also in accordance to the Hobbit custom of giving flower-names to women.

{{Quote|Maglor was mighty among the singers of old, named only after [[Daeron]] of Doriath.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]""}}

'''Maglor''' was the second of the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. He was known for his [[Minstrels|poetry and singing]],<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> but in [[Tirion]] he swore the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and shared in the woes it bred.<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

==History==
Maglor was present at the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. To what degree he participated in the slaughter is unknown, but later he composed the lament ''[[Noldolantë]]'', the Fall of the [[Noldor]], in memory of the terrible event.<ref name=""Flight""/> Following [[Fëanor]] into exile, Maglor witnessed his father die after he had fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The wife of Maglor. Art by [[Marya Filatova]]|125px]]
The sons of Fëanor settled in the eastern part of [[Beleriand]].  Maglor's ward was the opening in the hills between the two arms of the [[Gelion]] River, which acquired the name of '''[[Maglor's Gap]]'''.  Due to the lack of hills, the Gap was a natural route for attacks from the north, and the Noldor kept a strength of cavalry in that region.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

Maglor's Gap was held for four and a half centuries.  However, in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] invaded and laid waste to Maglor's land, forcing Maglor to flee to the fortress of his brother [[Maedhros]] on the hill of [[Himring]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Sixteen years later, he and Maedhros marched to the great battle that the [[Elves]] hoped would see their revenge upon [[Morgoth]], but they were defeated, partly by the treachery of [[Uldor the Accursed]]. Maglor himself slew Uldor, but all of the sons of Fëanor were wounded and they were forced to retreat to [[Mount Dolmed]]. The heavy loss led to the name of the battle thereafter: the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or the ""Battle of Unnumbered Tears.""  Maglor and his brothers took to a wild woodland life in [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Prior to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, one of the three [[Silmarils]] had been recovered from [[Iron Crown|Morgoth's Crown]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>  From his parents, [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] received the jewel and brought it to [[Doriath]]. True to their oath, the sons of Fëanor (led by [[Celegorm]]) demanded the Silmaril. When Dior refused to surrender it the brothers assaulted Thingol's ancient kingdom. [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]] and [[Curufin]] all fell, as did Dior and his wife, [[Nimloth of Doriath]]. But the four remaining brothers - Maglor, Maedhros, [[Amras]] and [[Amrod]] - did not recover the Silmaril, for [[Elwing]], the daughter of Dior and Nimloth, escaped.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
[[File:Turner Mohan - Maglor's Fosterling.jpg|thumb|175px|''Maglor's Fosterling'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]
Eventually the three brothers heard tiding that [[Elwing]] possessed a Silmaril and dwelt at the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Driven by their Oath, the remaining sons of Fëanor made a sudden attack upon the refugees of [[Gondolin]] and Doriath. However they were again thwarted, for Elwing escaped with the Silmaril across the [[Belegaer|Sea]] to her husband [[Eärendil]]. Together, they sailed into the [[Aman|West]] and their voyage would eventually cause the downfall of Morgoth. Meanwhile, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], Eärendil and Elwing's sons, captured in the battle, were adopted by Maglor, and it is said that love grew between them. It is also said that Maglor's heart grew sick with the Oath of Fëanor.
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea.jpg|thumb|175px|''Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

=== Post-'War of Wrath' history ===
After Morgoth's fall, the last two Silmarils were recovered from his [[Iron Crown]]. By this time, only Maedhros and Maglor remained of Fëanor's sons. In weariness and loathing, they demanded the jewels from [[Eönwë]], the herald of [[Manwë]]. Eönwë refused them the Silmarils due to their many evil deeds. Still driven, the two brothers crept into the camp of Eönwë and stole the jewels.

Though they were caught, Eönwë let them depart. Each brother took one jewel, but their evil deeds caused the holy Jewels to burn their hands. Maedhros in despair cast himself into a fiery fissure. Maglor, the last surviving son of Fëanor, threw his Silmaril into the Sea. Legend says that he still wanders the shores of the World, singing laments for his despair and regret.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> It is possible that some time later Maglor cast himself into the Sea, meeting his eventual doom.<ref name=""L131""/><ref>{{LB|4}}, p. 353: ""[Maglor] ''son of Fëanor, forgotten harper, singer doomed, who young when Laurelin yet bloomed to endless lamentation passed and in the tombless sea was cast''.""</ref><ref>[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]], ''[[Concerning ... 'The Hoard']]'': ""''… ''[Maedhros and Maglor]'', in a despairing attempt to carry out the Oath, stole ''[the Silmarils]'' again. But they were tormented by them, and at last they perished each with a jewel: one in a fiery cleft in the earth, and one in the Sea.''""</ref>

==Etymology==
''Maglor'' is not glossed in the mature [[Sindarin]], but being the [[Sindarized]] version of the [[Quenya]] name ''Makalaurë'',<ref name=Vinyar>{{VT|41b}}, p. 10</ref> it would mean ""Forging Gold"".<ref name=Feanor>{{PM|Feanor}}, pp. 352-353</ref> In a pure Sindarin rendition it would have been '''''Magalor'''''.<ref name=Vinyar />

In the [[Noldorin]] phase of the name, it is interpreted as ""Gold-cleaver"", also coming from ''Makalaurë''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, ""MAK-""</ref>

==Other names==
His [[father-name]] was '''''Kanafinwë''''', a name which in [[Quenya]] means ""Strong-voiced [[Finwë]]"". The shorter form was '''''Káno'''''. It is derived from ''[[káno]]'', a noun which means ""commander"", added to the name of his grandfather.<ref name=Feanor />

His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''Makalaurë'''''. Its meaning is unclear, but it is generally interpreted as ""Forging Gold"", being a prophetic reference to his skill in harping, whose sound was golden (here ''[[laurë]]'' being a poetic word and not referred to the metal).<ref name=Feanor />

{{Quote|But Lungorthin Lord of Balrogs<br>on the mouth smote him, and Morgoth smiled:<br>‘Nay, fear when thou feelest, when the flames lick thee.<br>and the whistling whips thy white body<br>and wilting flesh weal and torture!’|''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', Lines 96-100}}

'''Lungorthin''' was a [[Lord of Balrogs]] according to an early version of the [[legendarium]].

== History ==
Lungorthin is mentioned only once, in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]''; after [[Húrin]] was captured by [[Morgoth]], Lungorthin smote him on the mouth.<ref>{{LB|1}}, pp. 98, 102-3</ref>

== Etymology ==
According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], it is likely that Lungorthin is not another name for [[Gothmog]], as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.

{{Blockquote|The ''thane of Morgoth'' who smote him on the mouth (version I, 59) now becomes ''Lungorthin'', ''Lord of Balrogs'' (96)——which is probably to be interpreted as ‘a Balrog lord’, since Gothmog, reappears in the ‘Silmarillion’ tradition.|''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher Tolkien’s]] ''Commentary on Part I of the second version''}}

The name '''''Lungorthin''''' is in [[Noldorin]], according to ''[[Eldamo]]'', but its meaning is unclear. [[LUNG]] in [[Sindarin]] means “Heavy.” [[GAR]] means “fenced.” [[or]] means “above.”<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3398493419.html|articlename=ᴱN. ''Lungorthin'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=24 March 2022}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In Tolkien's first version of ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', ''[[Túrin son of Húrin & Glorund the Dragon]]'', ""Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs"" had no name and race, being referred to instead as an unknown ''thane of Morgoth'' who smote Húrin on the mouth.

There are no references to Lungorthin in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] later [[legendarium]] and as such, Lungorthin may have been abandoned as he never appeared within any of Tolkien's writing after ''The Lay of the Children of Húrin''.

{{Quote|It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. [...] The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]""}}

'''Durin's Bane''' was a [[Balrog]] who had no other recorded names. 

Durin's Bane was notable for surviving the [[War of Wrath]]. After sleeping deep within the [[Misty Mountains]] for thousands of years, he was awoken by the [[Dwarves of Moria]] in the [[Third Age]] and was responsible for the death of [[King of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Durin VI]] and the ruin of [[Moria]]. It was this Balrog that was encountered by the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] during the [[Quest of the Ring]].

==History==
===Early history===
Durin's Bane was first created as a [[Maia]]. However, like other [[evil spirits]], the Balrog followed [[Morgoth]] to [[Arda]] soon after its creation, contending with [[Manwë]] and other [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

It is not known in which of the [[Battles of Beleriand]] Durin's Bane fought in until the end of the [[First Age]], nor whether he served under [[Gothmog (Lord of Balrogs)|Gothmog]], the Lord of Balrogs. When the [[Host of the Valar]] defeated the hosts of Morgoth in the [[War of Wrath]], Durin's Bane managed to flee the overthrow of [[Thangorodrim]] and escaped into the east and hid in the roots of the [[Misty Mountains]] beneath [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}, fourth paragraph, p. 954</ref><ref>{{L|144}}, p. 180</ref>

===Awakening and the Third Age===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Dwarves Delve Too Deep.jpg|thumb|left|''The Dwarves delve too deep'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
For more than five millennia, Durin's Bane hibernated in his deep hiding place at the roots of the mountains in Khazad-dûm.

The Dwarves attempted to fight the Durin's Bane, but his power was far too great. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, [[Náin I|King Náin]] and many of the Dwarves were killed in {{TA|1981}}<ref name=""Year1981"">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1980, p. 1087</ref>, and the survivors were forced to flee.<ref name=""Durin"" /> [[Orcs]] were able to creep into Moria<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 241</ref> and, as a result, many of the [[Silvan Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]] fled to the south.<ref name=""Year1981"" />

The [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] was the climactic battle in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. It took place before the [[Great Gate]] of Moria in [[Third Age 2799|T.A. 2799]] and was a victory for the Dwarves. However, the victors did not conquer Moria because [[Dáin Ironfoot]], having slain the Orc [[Azog]], felt the terror of the Balrog at the gate.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1075</ref> Despite a failed attempt to recolonize Moria by [[Balin]] in [[Third Age 2989|T.A. 2989]],<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2989, p. 1090</ref> Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, and its nature remained hidden to the outside world.

===Passing of the Fellowship===
[[File:Manuel Castañón - Flame of Udûn.jpg|thumb|<nowiki>'</nowiki>''Flame of Udûn''<nowiki>'</nowiki> by Manuel Castañón]]
In January of [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] travelled through Moria on the way to [[Mount Doom]], reaching the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] on [[15 January]] of that year.<ref name=""January"" /> It was there they encountered the terrible creature, and the Elf [[Legolas]] instantly recognized it as a Balrog, while [[Gimli]] dropped his axe in awe, recognizing Durin's Bane. At once, the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] warned the members of the Fellowship that this creature was beyond them, commanding them to leave while he faced it.<ref name=""Bridge"" />

Standing firmly in the narrow bridge, Gandalf cried at the Balrog, which remained silent. The creature's fire dimmed and darkness spread around it while Gandalf's light stood. The Balrog struck out at the Wizard, but [[Glamdring]], Gandalf's sword, prevailed and the creature's sword was broken. The Balrog then jumped ahead and Gandalf broke the Bridge in front of him, but as the Balrog fell, he wrapped his whip around Gandalf's knees. This caused Gandalf to stagger and fall, and he was dragged into the abyss as he cried ""''Fly, you fools!''"" to the Fellowship.<ref name=""Bridge"" />
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Battle on Durin's Tower.jpg|thumb|250px|""The Battle on [[Durin's Tower]]"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Greg Hildebrandt]]]]
Neither he nor the Balrog were killed by the fall, and Gandalf pursued the creature for eight days until they climbed to the peak of [[Celebdil|Zirakzigil]], where [[Battle of the Peak|they fought]] for three days and two nights. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and his body broke the mountain-side as it fell. Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.<ref name=""White"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
During the composition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in the first ""Sketch of the Moria chapter"", [[Tolkien]] conceived that the Fellowship was pursued by Orcs and a [[Black Rider]], but soon wrote above it was a Balrog.<ref>{{RS|4XXV}}, p. 462</ref>

In the first full narrative of the chapter, the description of the Balrog is more human-like, which Tolkien noted should be changed to be less clear: ""''A figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it. They could see the furnace-fire of its yellow eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [?tongue]. Through the air it sprang over the fiery fissure. The flames leaped up to greet it and wreathed about it. Its streaming hair seemed to catch fire...''"". Tolkien also rejected a sentence of Gandalf's cry to the Balrog: ""''Go back into the fiery depths. It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since [[Fionwë]] son of [[Manwë]] overthrew Thangorodrim.''""<ref>{{TI|M2}}, pp. 198-199</ref>

Although it had no repercussion on the final version of the story, Tolkien considered in a hasty note that the battle on the Bridge was actually between Gandalf and [[Saruman]], apparently resulting on Gandalf coming out clad in white.<ref>{{TI|XII}}, p. 236</ref>

In the drafts of the ""[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]"" chapter, [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] think that no Balrog could lie in the Misty Mountains, so it should have been sent by Sauron from [[Orodruin]].<ref>{{TI|XIII}}, pp. 247, cf. note 11</ref>

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.
'''1981:''' [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|'''''The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)''''']]

The identity of Durin's Bane as a Balrog is apparently common knowledge among the Wise as Gandalf explains its history to the Fellowship in Moria before their encounter with it. He initially fails to connect this with the dark power he encounters, and Celeborn still has no knowledge of it. Balrogs are bafflingly stated to be the deadliest of the servants of Sauron though Gandalf also refers to it as a Spawn of [[Morgoth|Melkor]]

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane has wings. Jackson's Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only his horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen. In the film continuity, the Orcs of Moria (here specified as ""goblins"") have crafted their armor and weapons to match the fiery appearance of the Balrog. <ref>Chris Smith, ''The Lord of The Rings: Weapons and Warfare'',  p.62</ref> Gandalf is also aware of the creature's identity prior to entering Moria, having previously learned of it from [[Saruman]].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Balrog is the boss of the level ""Abyss Fight"". He cannot be harmed except when he is stunned with Gandalf's lightning.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'':'''
:The players must assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog. This fight is notable among players of the game for its difficulty and the Balrog's very high amount of health points.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Many of the Evil factions can summon a Balrog, specifically Durin's Bane, for a short period of time. He is one of the mightiest units in the game, only able to be summoned with experience points. He is similar in design to the Balrog in the movie.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Like in the previous installment, the Balrog can be summoned by evil factions.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The real name of Durin's Bane is given as ""'''Askâdurs'''"" and he is revealed to have fought against Dwarves as part of [[Morgoth]]'s armies during the [[First Age]]. He is encountered in various flashback instances (where the player controls historical characters), which showcase his awakening by Dwarves in [[Third Age 1980|TA 1980]], the fall of Khazad-dûm [[Third Age 1981|the year after]] and the Dwarves of [[Balin]]'s company fleeing from the ancient evil, among others. After Gandalf defeats him, the lifeless body of Durin's Bane can be found on the slopes of Zirakzigil. Despite the players knowing that the Balrog is dead, another Servant of Sauron tests their will and fears by portraying an illusion of him. In the illusion, the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog on the [[Endless Stair]] is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Balrog defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Balrog in order to combat the illusion.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane is resurrected after his defeat by Gandalf, and must be fought again in Moria. In the Evil Campaign, Durin's Bane is playable in two battles. He kills Gimli, who makes his last stand in Moria, and [[Treebeard]], who takes part in the final battle for [[the Shire]].

'''2013: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane is only seen as a light that chases the player(s) through Moria. When they reach the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, he appears in a cutscene where Gandalf destroys the bridge and the Balrog pulls him down. The player then controls Gandalf and has to grab Glamdring and land on Durin's Bane and stab him while avoiding the Balrog's fiery breath. When this is over, the game starts another cutscene that ends the level. Later, Gandalf appears on a snowy mountain with a tower on top. When he reaches the top of the tower, the Balrog climbs on. The Balrog repeatedly sweeps his fiery whip and strikes the ground with his sword. Lightning then begins to strike at one place and the Balrog breathes fire and is weakened. Gandalf then uses his sword to direct the lightning at Durin's Bane and his health goes down. The lightning will strike at three different places and when the Balrog loses all of his health by being hit three times, he will fall off the mountain and die.

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''
:'''Episode 7: ''[[The Eye]]'':'''
::Durin's Bane makes an appearance lurking beneath a large [[Mithril]] vein at the very depths of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. When an orange leaf lands directly in front of him and catches on fire, disturbing his slumber, the Balrog roars.

'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season Two:'''
:Durin's Bane appears after [[Durin III]] digs into a cavern full of Mithril at the urging of a Dwarven [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]]. In spite of his son [[Durin IV]]'s attempts at saving him, he is killed after removing his ring and jumping toward the Balrog with his axe before the entire cavern collapses around him.

'''Elwing the White''' was the third child and only daughter of [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] and [[Nimloth of Doriath]], and later on the wife of the well-known [[Eärendil]] ''the Mariner''.

Elwing had [[Twins|twin]] brothers who were elder to her and they were [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]]. It is said that she could speak with birds.

==History==
She was named Elwing, ""which is Star-spray, for she was born on a night of stars, whose light glittered in the spray of the waterfall of [[Lanthir Lamath]] beside her father's house.""<ref name=""Doriath"">{{S|22}}</ref>

When Elwing was very young, her father Dior inherited the throne of [[Doriath]], along with the [[Silmaril]] reclaimed by her renowned grandfather [[Beren]], a [[Men|Man]] of the [[Edain]]. Then she and her twin-brothers, Eluréd and Elurín, moved with their parents, Dior and Nimloth, to the caves of [[Menegroth]] in Doriath. In {{FA|506}}, the [[sons of Fëanor]], driven by their terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], [[Second Kinslaying|attacked Menegroth]] and slew her parents (the King and Queen of Doriath) and took her elder brothers in captivity to starve in the wild. She escaped the [[Second Kinslaying]] with the Silmaril and fled to the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=""Doriath"" /> There she met and married [[Eärendil]] and gave birth to twins [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]].
[[File:Elena Kukanova - The Seagull.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''The Seagull'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
In {{FA|538}} the remaining sons of Fëanor attacked the Havens of Sirion to reclaim the Silmaril in her possession. They captured Elwing's sons but as they came for her she cast herself into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].

Through the power of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], she took the form of a white bird and came to her husband in his ship [[Vingilótë]] with the Silmaril upon her breast.<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|24}}</ref>

Elwing sailed with her husband on his great voyage to the [[Aman|West]] and, unlike the crew of his ship, refused to be separated from him when he sought the [[Valar]] in [[Valinor]]. While he spoke to them, she went to [[Alqualondë]] and told the [[Falmari]] (who, as [[Teleri]], were of Thingol's kin) there about the tumultuous history of [[Beleriand]], and later persuaded them to sail their ships for the [[Host of Valinor]]. When the Valar allowed Eärendil and Elwing, both being Half-elven, to choose which of the races they would be members of, Eärendil let her make the choice for them. Because of what had happened to her grandmother [[Lúthien]], Elwing decided to be counted among the Elves, as did her husband for her sake. 
[[File:Roger Garland - Earendil and Elwing.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|''Earendil and Elwing'' by [[Roger Garland]]]]
Elwing was given a white [[Elwing's tower|tower]] northward upon the borders of the [[Sundering Seas]], and there she helped seabirds that came to her windows. Eventually she learned their language, and was able to fly with white wings, and she still flies to meet Eärendil whenever he returns from his voyages through the sky. ""Then the far-sighted among the Elves that dwelt in the Lonely Isle would see her like a white bird, shining, rose-stained in the sunset, as she soared in joy to greet the coming of Vingilot to haven.""<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|24}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Elwing'' means ""Star-spray"" in [[Sindarin]], composed of ''[[êl]]'' (""star"") + ''[[wing]]'' (""foam, spray"").<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Elwing''</ref><ref>{{PM|XI4}}, pp. 349</ref><ref>{{PM|Ros}}, pp. 369-70</ref>

{{Quote|Maedhros did deeds of surpassing valour, and the Orcs fled before his face; for since his torment upon Thangorodrim his spirit burned like a white fire within, and he was as one that returns from the dead.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]""}}

'''Maedhros''' was one of the princes of the [[Noldor]] and was eldest of the [[Sons of Fëanor]].

==History==
Maedhros was born in [[Valinor]] during the Time of the [[Two Trees]]. After the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from [[Tirion]] in Valinor, he went with his father to [[Formenos]] in exile.<ref>{{S|7}}</ref> When [[Morgoth]] killed [[Finwë]] and stole Fëanor's beloved [[Silmarils]], Maedhros and his brothers took the terrible [[Oath of Fëanor]] to recover the jewels.<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|9}}</ref>

Maedhros went with his father to [[Alqualondë]], where the [[First Kinslaying]] broke out, in which he took part. When Fëanor sailed off without the host of [[Fingolfin]], Maedhros thought that he was planning to return and carry across the others. He expected that the first ship would carry [[Fingon]], his friend. When he learned that in fact, Fëanor planned to abandon them to prevent Fingolfin from following, he was angry and, alone of his brothers, refused to help burn the ships.<ref name=""Flight"" /> 

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Maedhros’s Rescue from Thangorodrim.jpg|thumb|left|''Maedhros's rescue from Thangorodrim'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When Fëanor was killed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], Maedhros inherited the claim to the [[King of the Noldor|kingship]] in [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. However, there was no time for him to fulfill this claim, as Morgoth sent an embassy, feigning the surrender of a Silmaril. The Oath driving him, Maedhros also feigned to treat with Morgoth, but instead he was captured by Morgoth's embassy. Morgoth held Maedhros captive for around thirty years<ref name="":0"">{{GA|49-61}}</ref>, hanging him by a steel shackle about the wrist of his right hand from the face of a precipice of [[Thangorodrim]]. In a daring rescue, his cousin Fingon, helped by [[Thorondor]] the King of Eagles, saved him from torment, but he was forced to cut off Maedhros' hand to release him. With the griefs between their houses assuaged, at the [[council in Mithrim]], Maedhros relinquished his claim as High King of the Noldor to [[Fingolfin]], an action his brothers did not approve of.<ref name=""Return"">{{S|13}}</ref>

Seeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved them out of [[Hithlum]], and later ruled the lands around the [[Hill of Himring]], which became known as the [[March of Maedhros]]. Allied with Fingolfin, he won the battle of [[Dagor Aglareb]], and, thanks to his daring deeds during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Himring]] stood while many other elven realms fell.<ref name=""Return"" /> 

Hearing word of the deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the [[Union of Maedhros]], an alliance to lay siege to Morgoth's fortress of [[Angband]]. However, no support came from [[Thingol]] or [[Nargothrond]], due to the deeds of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], Maedhros' brothers. The Union and the siege was utterly broken after the defeat in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Himring was garrisoned by [[Orcs]]. Maedhros and his brothers lived in [[Ossiriand]], consorting with the [[Laiquendi]].<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

Maedhros learned that [[Dior]], son of Beren and Lúthien, had inherited the Silmaril that they had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, he was convinced by his brother [[Celegorm]] to attack Doriath. Celegorm, [[Caranthir]], and Curufin were slain by Dior Eluchíl, the King of Doriath, who was in turn slain by them. Dior's sons, [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's servants in the forest, leading Maedhros to search for the innocent youths, but to no avail. After learning that [[Elwing]], Dior's daughter, had survived, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the [[Havens of Sirion]]. The Noldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]] in the sack, but Elwing escaped with the Silmaril, jumping off a cliff and into the ocean.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>
	
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Maedhros Casts Himself into a Chasm.jpg|thumb|''Maedhros casts himself into a chasm'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the [[War of Wrath]], he and his last surviving brother, [[Maglor]], stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the [[Valar]] from Morgoth. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned the hands of Maglor and Maedhros. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> It is uncertain whether he was eventually released from [[Mandos]], or whether he still remains there with his father till the [[Dagor Dagorath|End of the World]].

==Etymology==
''Maedhros'' is [[Sindarin]], a compound of ''maed'' (""shapely"") + ''ross'' (""red-haired""), which are [[Sindarized]] elements of his names '''''Mai'''timo'' and '''''Russ'''andol'' (both explained below).<ref name=""Notes"">{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 366</ref> Thus this name would be properly spelled ''Maedros''.<ref name=""Feanor"">{{PM|Feanor}}, pp. 352-353</ref>

In the earlier [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, the name ''Maidhros''/''Maedhros'' is said to mean ""Pale-glitter"". It is formed by the adding up ''[[maidh]]'' (""pale"", ""fallow"" or ""fawn"") and ""archaic"" ''[[rhoss]]'' (""flash"", ""glitter of metal"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""MAD"", ""RUS-""</ref>

==Other names==
Maedhros' [[father-name]] was '''''Nelyafinwë''''' (""Finwë third""), shorter form '''''Nelyo''''', as his grandfather and father both shared the name ''Finwë''.<ref name=""Feanor"" /> ''[[Nelya]]'' is a [[Quenya]] adjective that means ""third"".

His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''Maitimo''''' (""Well-shaped One""), for he was noted for his bodily comeliness.<ref name=""Feanor"" />

His brothers and other kin gave him the [[epessë]] '''''Russandol''''' (""Copper-top""), referring to the dark red hair he inherited from his grandfather [[Mahtan]].<ref name=""Feanor"" /> It is clearly derived from ''[[russa]]'' (""red-haired""). In relation with this name, it is also notable that Maedhros also wore a copper circlet.<ref name=""Notes"" />

In [[Noldorin]], he was given the surname of '''''Erchamui''''' ('One-handed'); the same as [[Beren]].<ref>{{VT|45a}}</ref>

'''Galion''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elf]] who served as the king's butler in [[Thranduil|Thranduil's]] [[Elvenking's Halls|halls]] in the [[Woodland Realm]] of northeastern [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=barrels>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

==History==
Galion served King [[Thranduil]] and presumably Thranduil's son, [[Legolas]]. One evening in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>, Galion and the chief of the guards decided to taste some new wine that had recently arrived to ""''see if it is fit for the king's table''"". The heady vintage from [[Dorwinion]] soon caused the two Elves to fall asleep, which gave [[Bilbo Baggins]] his chance to free [[Thorin]] and [[Thorin and Company|the other Dwarves]], all of whom had been imprisoned in Thranduil's dungeons during the [[Quest of Erebor]]. Using the chief guard's keys and his [[One Ring|Magic Ring]], Bilbo freed the [[Dwarves]] and secreted them into several empty barrels. When other Elves arrived to push the barrels into the [[Forest River]] - which flowed through the [[Elvenking's Halls]] and eventually led to the [[Long Lake]] - they found Galion and woke him. Noticing the heaviness of some ""empty"" barrels, Galion growled at the workers and ordered them to push the barrels into the water.<ref name=barrels/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Galion'' is said to be ''not'' [[Sindarin]], although perhaps ""'Sindarized' in shape"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 54</ref><ref group=note>For a name given the same description, cf. ''[[Lake-town#Etymology|Esgaroth]]''.</ref>

'''Bungo Baggins''' ({{TA|2846}} - {{TA|2926|n}}, died aged 80<ref name=""Baggins"">{{App|C1}}</ref>) was a well-to-do [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], and the father of [[Bilbo Baggins]].  

==History==
Bungo was the eldest child of [[Mungo Baggins]] and [[Laura Grubb]]. He married [[Belladonna Took]], daughter of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], towards {{SR|1290}}. Bungo and Belladonna had only one child together, the famous [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref name=""Baggins""/>

Father and son were so much alike, in looks and behaviour, that Bilbo seemed like a ""second edition"" of his ""solid and comfortable"" father.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref>

Apart from fathering Bilbo, Bungo's other achievements were that he built and excavated the rather luxurious [[Bag End]] in the [[Hobbiton Hill|Hill]] in [[Hobbiton]] and that he laid down several bottles of [[Old Winyards]] wine that would be enjoyed by [[Rorimac Brandybuck]] after [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]<ref name=""Party""/> and by the small party on [[21 September]] {{TA|3018}} that [[Frodo Baggins]] gave before leaving Bag End.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

Bungo had an aptitude for either remembering or coining proverbs.  Bilbo quoted his father's sayings ""third time pays for all"" before making his first descent into [[Erebor]],<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> ""Every worm has his weak spot"" while talking to the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]],<ref name=""Inside"">{{H|Inside}}</ref> and ""while there's life there's hope"" when leading the Dwarves down to Smaug's lair.<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Bungo'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Bunga''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

{{quote|Fingolfin was the strongest, the most steadfast, and the most valiant.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië]]""}}

'''Fingolfin''' was a [[Noldor]]in prince of the [[First Age]], son of [[Finwë]] and his second wife [[Indis]]. During the [[Flight of the Noldor]], Fingolfin led the hosts that refused to accept his half-brother [[Fëanor]] as their king and were forced to cross the [[Helcaraxë]]. In [[Beleriand]], he became the first [[High King of the Noldor]] and, along with [[House of Fingolfin|his children]], he helped to keep the [[Siege of Angband]] against the forces of [[Morgoth]]. He is renowned for his valiant death in single combat with Morgoth at the end of the [[Dagor Bragollach]].

==History==
===Early life===
Having different mothers, he and his older half-brother Fëanor never felt a close bond with each other. This lack of affinity developed into rivalry when [[Morgoth|Melkor]] secretly told each of them that the other was planning on driving them out of [[Tirion]].

During the days of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] in [[Valinor]], as Melkor's lies were taking root in the minds of the Noldor, a number of the Noldor started to believe that the [[Valar]] were somehow restraining them from going back to [[Cuiviénen]] in Middle-earth. Melkor's cunning had caused the suspicions he sowed to outweigh the Noldor's knowledge that the greatest Gift of the Valar was total free will.

===Unrest of the Noldor===
{{quote|King and father, wilt thou not restrain the pride of our brother, Curufinwë, who is called the Spirit of Fire, all too truly? By what right does he speak for all our people, as if he were King? Thou it was who long ago spoke before the Quendi, bidding them accept the summons of the Valar to Aman. Thou it was that led the Noldor upon the long road through the perils of Middle-earth to the light of Eldamar. If thou dost not now repent of it, two sons at least thou hast to honour thy words.|Fingolfin to Finwë, {{S|Unrest}}}}
[[File:Tuuliky - Half Brothers.jpg|thumb|left|''Half Brothers'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]
Fëanor was the first to speak against the Valar, and [[Finwë]] summoned all of the lords of his house to resolve the issue. As Fingolfin was contending with his father to convince him to restrain Fëanor, the latter arrived fully armed with weapons he had secretly forged. Even though Fingolfin accepted him as his senior, Fëanor threatened Fingolfin, who was unarmed, with his sword, after which Fingolfin bowed to his father Finwë and left, only to be followed by Fëanor and threatened again in public. This threat, in the main square in front of the Mindon, King Finwë's seat, was witnessed by many as Fëanor drew his sword and placed the point to Fingolfin's breast. In the face of this public humiliation, Fingolfin turned quietly and walked away without a word to Fëanor, in an effort to avoid division and dissension within his father's House and among the Noldor.<ref name=""Unrest"">{{S|Unrest}}</ref> 

Following Fëanor's threat to Fingolfin, Fëanor was banished from Tirion for twelve years by the Valar; Finwë chose to follow Fëanor, self-banishing himself as well.<ref name=""Unrest""/> The rule of the Noldor was then committed to Fingolfin by Manwë and Fingolfin, who had up to this point been generally known by his [[mother-name]], took the name of ''Finwë''.<ref name=""MR22"">{{MR|P3II3e}}, note 22</ref>

After the escape of Melkor from Valinor, during the feast Manwë held for the reconciliation of the Eldar, Fingolfin publicly forgave Fëanor and called him ""Half-brother in blood, full brother in heart"".<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

===Journey to Middle-earth===
{{quote|I have not rejected the Valar, nor their authority in all matters where it is just for them to use it. But if the Eldar were given free choice to leave Middle-earth and go to Aman, and accepted it because of the loveliness and bliss of that land, their free choice to leave it and return to Middle-earth, when it has become dark and desecrated, cannot be taken away. Moreover I have an errand in Middle-earth, the avenging of the blood of my father upon Morgoth, whom the Valar let loose among us. Fëanor seeks first his stolen treasures.|Fingolfin, ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', ""[[Shibboleth of Fëanor]]""}}
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Middle Earth.jpg|thumb|left|''Middle-earth'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
After King Finwë died, murdered by Morgoth, Fëanor rallied up the Noldor and gave a [[Speech of Fëanor|passionate speech]] which concluded with his [[Oath of Fëanor|blasphemous oath]]. While Fingolfin spoke against Fëanor, and fierce words awoke that nearly came to violence, in the end nearly all of the Noldor chose to follow him to [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]].<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref> 

Fingolfin led the largest host of the Noldor that departed [[Aman]] for [[Middle-earth]]. Though against his wisdom,<ref name=""Flight"" /> Fingolfin joined with full will in the rebellion and the exile,<ref name=Case>{{PM|Case}}, p. 336</ref> desiring to go to Middle-earth in order to avenge the murder of Finwë upon Morgoth.<ref name=""PM|XINotes"">{{PM|XINotes}}, note 33</ref> Additional reasons were that his son Fingon urged him, he would not be sundered from his people that were eager to go, nor leave them to the rash counsels of Fëanor, and he did not forget his words before the throne of Manwë.<ref name=""Flight""/>

As days passed in their exile, more and more of the Noldor started speaking against Fëanor, for their journey was difficult, and they feared the prophecy of [[Mandos]]. After Fëanor's Noldor acquired the ships of the [[Teleri]] following the [[First Kinslaying]], Fëanor and his followers used them to sail across the sea. Fëanor burned the ships after reaching Middle-earth, stranding the others, for he thought the followers of Fingolfin would prove to be useless.<ref name=""Flight"" />

Fingolfin and his people saw the smoke of the ships from afar, and chose to travel through the icy Helcaraxë, for they were ashamed to go back to Valinor, and were angry at Fëanor. The journey was hard and many died, yet they were filled with hope when they saw the Moon for the first time. Soon after, at the rising of the Sun, he came to the [[Gates of Angband]] and smote upon them, but [[Morgoth]] stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Noldor, realizing they could not be victorious in this way, then came to the northern shores of [[Lake Mithrim]], from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn.<ref name=""Return"">{{S|Return}}</ref>

===Rule in Beleriand===
Shortly after Fëanor's death, his oldest son Maedhros was captured by Morgoth. Learning this, Fingolfin's oldest son [[Fingon]] rescued [[Maedhros]], with whom he was a good friend. At a subsequent [[council in Mithrim]], Fingolfin was chosen to be the first [[High King of the Noldor]] in [[Middle-earth]], with Maedhros waiving his claim. Fingolfin ruled from [[Hithlum]], by the northern shores of [[Lake Mithrim]].<ref name=""Return""/> After defeating the [[Orcs]] in the [[Dagor Aglareb]] (""Glorious Battle"") in {{FA|60}}, Fingolfin helped to maintain the [[Siege of Angband]] for nearly four hundred years. 

As High King, Fingolfin maintained amicable relations between various factions within Beleriand. He acknowledged the high-kingship of Thingol over the Sindar in Beleriand,<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, note 11</ref> and conversely, even after learning of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and banning the use of [[Quenya]], Thingol kept friendship with Fingolfin and his folk.<ref>{{GA|105}}</ref> When [[Men]] arrived in Beleriand they became allied to the Noldor, and added to their strength.<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Notable among these men was [[Hador]], who entered the house of Fingolfin in {{FA|405}}, and who Fingolfin made the first [[Lord of Dor-lómin]] in {{FA|416}}.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, §31, p. 228</ref>

In {{FA|422}}, seeing that his people were become numerous and strong, and that the Men were many and valiant, Fingolfin pondered an assault upon Angband as he knew that they lived in danger while Morgoth was free to labour and devise evils that none could foretell until revealed. Most of the Noldor were little disposed to hearken to Fingolfin though; they were content with things as they were, trusting them to last, and thus slow to begin an assault where many would surely perish. Fingolfin's designs for an assault therefore came to naught.<ref name=""Ruin""/><ref>{{GA|133}}</ref>

=== Battle of Sudden Flame and the Fall of Fingolfin ===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Morgoth and the High King of Noldor (1992).jpg|thumb|''Morgoth and the High King of Noldor'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
In {{FA|455}},<ref>{{GA|147}}</ref> the Siege was ended by the sudden assault of Morgoth in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (""Battle of Sudden Flame""). The realm of [[Dorthonion]] was first hit, and the sons of Finarfin who held it, [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]], were slain. Fingolfin and Fingon marched from Hithlum to their aid, but were driven back with great loss to the fortresses of [[Ered Wethrin]], and these they hardly defended against the Orcs. Fingolfin's vassal Hador, along with Hador's younger son [[Gundor]], fell defending his rearguard at [[Eithel Sirion]].<ref name=""Ruin""/> 

Sundered from his kinsmen, and seeing what he believed to be the ruin of his people, Fingolfin rode to Angband in wrath and despair and [[Fall of Fingolfin|fell to Morgoth after challenging him to single combat]]. During the battle Fingolfin wounded Morgoth seven times, and managed one last stab to Morgoth's foot before his death; wounds that would never fully heal. Before Morgoth could feed Fingolfin to his [[wolves]], Fingolfin's body was rescued by [[Thorondor]], the King of Eagles, and brought to a mountaintop overlooking [[Gondolin]] where [[Turgon]] built a [[Fingolfin's Cairn|cairn]] over the remains of his father.<ref name=""Ruin""/>

[[Fingon]] succeeded him as the [[High King of the Noldor]].

== Characteristics ==
Fingolfin was the strongest and most valiant of the sons of Finwë.<ref>{{S|5}}</ref>

In the [[Ancient Quenya]] of Aman, the spirant '''s'''' became voiced as '''z''' when between vowels. While this was retained in [[Vanyarin]], it was rhotacized in Noldorin, eventually becoming '''r'''. Due to the prestige of the Vanyar, this was change resisted by some of the Noldor (especially those hostile to Fëanor) and the children of Indis. The continued use of the Vanyar (z) pronunciation by the children of Indis, however, was not liked by the general people, even among many who were faithful to Fingolfin & Finarfin and against Fëanor.<ref>{{PE|OP2}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Fingolfin.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Fingolfin'' is [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed, although it is said that it is the [[Sindarized]] form of the name ''Finwë Ñolofinwë'' (""Wise Finwë"").<ref name=""Finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 344-5</ref>

However, in the [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, ''Fingolfin'' is given as ""Magical Skill"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""PHIN""</ref> In later versions, [[Tolkien]] considered changing the name to ''Ingolfin'', as coming from ''[[Ingoldo]]'', but the idea was soon discarded.<ref name=""Eldarin"">{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 118</ref>

==Other names==
His [[father-name]] was '''''Ñolofinwë''''', with the stem [[NGOL|''ñolo'']] (related to ""wisdom"") attached to the name of his father. Later, during the Exile of the Noldor, Fingolfin added ''Finwë'' to the beginning of this name, in pursuance of his claim to be [[King of the Noldor]] after his father's death.<ref name=""Finwe""/> This would result in '''''Finwë·ñolofinwë'''''.<ref name=""Eldarin""/>

His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Aracáno]]''''' (""High Chieftain""), and was held to be ‘prophetic’.<ref name=""PM|XINotes""/> He further gave this name to his son [[Argon]].<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360. Cf. also p. 345</ref> 

After Fëanor and Finwë's banishment, a title he was known by was '''''Vinya Finwë''''' (""Young / new Finwë"").<ref name=Eldarin/><ref group=note>In both [[Morgoth's Ring]] and [[Parma Eldalamberon 17]] it is stated that he was also known as '''''Ingoldo Finwë''''', with ''Ingoldo'' being his mother-name  before being changed by Tolkien. There is no known use of '''''Aracáno Finwë'''''</ref>

Earlier titles in [[Noldorin]] were '''''Aran Chithlum''''' (""King of Hithlum"") and '''''Taur Egledhrim''''' (""King of the Exiles"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""TĀ""</ref>

'''Elros''' was the son of [[Eärendil]], the great hero of the [[First Age]], and his wife [[Elwing]]. He was the twin brother of [[Elrond]] and both were [[Half-elven]].<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

Choosing to live as a mortal [[Men|Man]], he became a lord of the [[Edain]] and the first [[King of Númenor]], taking the royal name '''Tar-Minyatur'''.

==History==
=== Life in Beleriand ===
Elros and Elrond were born in the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] during the darkest days of the First Age, when the forces of [[Morgoth]] controlled most of [[Beleriand]]. When the twins were just six years old, the [[Sons of Fëanor]], bound by their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], assaulted the Havens in the [[Third Kinslaying]] since they desired the [[Silmaril]] on the [[Nauglamír]] held by Elwing. Eärendil was at sea, and Elwing escaped with the Nauglamír and jumped into the sea.<ref name=""Earendil"" /> [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], the only Sons of Fëanor to survive the assault upon the Havens, took Elros and Elrond as captives<ref name=""Earendil"" /> and abandoned them in a cave with a fall of water over the entrance instead of killing them.<ref name=""L211"">{{L|211}}, answer to Question 4</ref> But Maglor took pity upon Elrond and Elros and rescued them and a mutual love grew between Maglor and the young twins afterwards.<ref name=""Earendil"" /> Elros was given the name ""Elf of the spray"" or ""star-foam"" (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]), because he was found playing in the water of the waterfall.<ref name=""L211"" />
[[File:Catherine Karina Chmiel - And Maglor took pity upon them.jpg|thumb|left|''And Maglor took pity upon them'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]

After the [[War of Wrath]] and the destruction of Beleriand, the Valar gave the twin ''[[Peredhil]]'' the choice over their race and fate. Elros chose the [[Gift of Men]],<ref name=""Earendil"" /> but still, he was blessed with a life longer than any other mortal Man's.

=== First King of Númenor ===
In the first years of the [[Second Age]], the Valar had prepared for the Edain, as a reward for their struggle against Morgoth, a large island in the western part of the [[Great Sea]]. Now by right a lord of the [[Edain]],<ref group=""note"">His father, Eärendil, was a descendant of the Lords of all Three Houses</ref> Elros led his people across the sea, guided by the [[Star of Eärendil]] his father, to the island. For this the island was called [[Elenna]] meaning ""starwards"", and was the closest of mortal lands to the [[Blessed Realm]], though Men were [[Ban of the Valar|forbidden to go]] so far westward that the coasts of Elenna were no longer visible. The Valar also gave the Edain substantially longer lifespans than those of Men remaining in Middle-earth, and Elros and his descendants had the longest lives of all the people.<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Elros founded the realm of [[Númenor]] and became its first [[King of Númenor|King]] in the year 32 of the Second Age. He took a royal name in [[Quenya]], ''Tar-Minyatur'', thus setting a tradition for the kings of Númenor to take a royal name in Quenya.<ref name=""Kings"" /> He brought with him the [[Ring of Barahir]], the [[Dramborleg|Axe of Tuor]], the [[Bow of Bregor|Bow]] of [[Bregor]] and [[Thingol]]'s sword [[Aranrúth]] as family heirlooms.<ref>{{UT|3a}}, Note 2</ref>

The city of [[Armenelos]], including the tower and the citadel, were constructed during the reign of Elros.<ref name=""Akallabeth"" /> Elros had four children: three sons, [[Vardamir|Vardamir Nólimon]], [[Manwendil]], and [[Atanalcar]]; and one daughter, [[Tindómiel]].<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref><ref group=""note"">Elros' children [[Tindómiel]], [[Manwendil]] and [[Atanalcar]] are referred to by name only in the family tree ""The Earlier Generations of the Line of Elros"", which is included in only some editions of ''Unfinished Tales''.</ref> 

=== Resignation of life ===
Elros shared the same physical potentiality of life as Elrond. Since, however, he elected to remain among the kindred of Men, he retained the chief human characteristic of ""seeking elsewither"" (as the Eldar called it), the desire to depart from [[Arda|the World]].<ref>{{NM|P3xi}}</ref> He remained unwearied until he was five hundred years old and then laid down his life.<ref name=""Kings"" />

Elros's eldest son took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] as [[Vardamir|Tar-Vardamir]]. But because Elros had lived so long, Tar-Vardamir was already old, and he immediately surrendered the Sceptre to his own son, [[Tar-Amandil]].<ref name=""Kings"" />

==Etymology==
In a letter from 1958 [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained that ''Elros'' is a [[Sindarin]] name that he was given, because he was found playing in the water of a waterfall that fell over the entrance to a cave and that the name is a compound of ''eld>ell'', the Sindarin term for the High-Elven exiles, and ''ros'' based on primitive Elvish ''rossē'' meaning ""dew, spray (of fall or fountain)"".<ref name=""L211"" /> In an essay that was probably written between 1959 and 1960 J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as ""Star-glitter"".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 26, second paragraph about Hadhodrond</ref> In an excursus on the names of Finwë's descendants that was written in 1968 or later J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as ""star-foam"".<ref name=""Shibboleth"">{{PM|Finwe}}, paragraph about the names of Elrond and Elros, p. 349</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Elros''</ref> The Sindarin elements are ''[[el]]'' (""star"") and ''[[ros]]'' (""foam"").<ref name=""Elements"">{{S|Elements}}, entries ''êl'' and ''ros''</ref> In an essay on ""The Problem of Ros"" that was written in 1969 or later J.R.R. Tolkien considered the possibility that ros was a Bëorian word for ""foam"" and for the ""white crest of waves"", but he rejected this idea, because of the Sindarin name Cair Andros.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, p. 369</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Quenya]] form of ''Elros'' was '''''Elerossë'''''.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />

After Elros ascended the throne of Númenor he was known by the [[Quenya]] title, '''''Tar-Minyatur''''' in the Scroll of Kings.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, first paragraph</ref> Tar-Minyatur means ""High first-ruler"" in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, paragraph about Itarilde (Idril), p. 348</ref> consisting of ''[[tar]]'' (""high"") + ''[[minya]]'' (""first"") + ''[[tur]]'' (""master, lord"").<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entries ''[[minas]]'', ''[[tar|tar-]]'', ''[[tur]]''</ref> All the Kings and [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queens]] after Elros also used the prefix ''Tar-'' in their royal titles in the Scroll of Kings.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, first paragraph and I to XXV</ref>

In early versions of the [[legendarium]], Elros' [[Adûnaic]] name was ''Indilzar'',<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 164</ref> which was changed to '''''Gimilzôr'''''. However, in later versions of the Númenórean tale ''[[Ar-Gimilzôr|(Ar-)Gimilzôr]]'' was the name of the twenty-third King of Númenor.<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}, pp. 380-1 (§20)</ref>

{{Quote|Next came the Noldor, a name of wisdom. They are the Deep Elves, and the friends of Aulë. Their lord was Finwë, wisest of all the children of the world. His kindred are renowned in song, for they fought and laboured long and grievously in the northern lands of old.|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', ""[[Of the Coming of the Elves]]""}}
'''Finwë''' was the first [[King of the Noldor]] and establisher of the [[House of Finwë]] from which branched three other great houses: the [[House of Fëanor]], the [[House of Fingolfin]], and the [[House of Finarfin]].

Finwë was descended of [[Tata]] and [[Tatië]], and thus of the [[Tatyar]] clan. In his youth at [[Cuiviénen]] he was gallant and adventurous, and great friends with [[Elwë]] of the [[Nelyar]] clan. Due to the lies of [[Melkor]], he was initially suspicious of the [[Valar]], but after visiting [[Valinor]] as one of the [[Three Ambassadors]], he became ardently in favour of accepting their invitation for the [[Quendi]] to relocate and join them. On his return, he [[Debate of the Quendi|strongly advocated for migration]] and convinced many to accept. The Tatyar who chose to follow Finwë became known as the [[Noldor]] and he became their first King.

Finwë led his people through the [[Great Journey]] and in [[Eldamar]] established the great city [[Tirion]]. He further played a significant role in bringing the [[Falmari]] to Aman, and constructing their city of [[Alqualondë]].

After the birth of his great son, [[Fëanor]], his wife, [[Míriel]] became tired of life and chose to die. Finwë long waited and pleaded for her to return, but eventually lost hope that she would. By [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel|leave of the Valar]], Finwë was permitted to re-marry and took [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]] as his second wife: from her he had many additional children, including [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]].

Eventually [[Unchaining of Melkor|Melkor was released]] and he slowly [[Unrest of the Noldor|fomented discontent among the Noldor]]; an especial target of Melkor's was the existing friction between Fëanor and his half-brothers. This finally erupted as a threat of violence by Fëanor against Fingolfin, and Fëanor was subsequently banished from Tirion; Finwë, holding himself unkinged, followed him. Soon after, Melkor returned, with [[Ungoliant]], during a [[High feast#High feast of 1495|great feast]] and first [[Darkening of Valinor|slew the Two Trees]], then slew Finwë, who alone was willing to stand against them.

After Finwë's death, he voluntarily forfeited any chance of [[Elven life cycle#Death and reincarnation|reincarnation]] in exchange for Míriel being returned to life.

==History==
===Early life in Middle-earth===
At the beginning of the [[First Age]], the [[Elves]] [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke at Cuiviénen]].<ref name=""Annals"">{{MR|P2e}}, pp. 71-4</ref> Long they dwelt there, walking the world in wonder, [[Primitive Quendian|making speech]] and naming what they perceived;<ref name=""captivity"">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> all of [[Arda]] they loved.<ref>{{WJ|Appendix}}</ref>

Within time though, the Elves were discovered by [[Melkor]], and their natural happiness was dimmed by fear as he sent his shadows to spy on and waylay them, and often Elves who went too far abroad would vanish and never return.<ref name=""captivity"">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> The younger Elves, in their pride, came to believe that it was ''their mission'' to fight the Dark, and ultimately to posses the world of Arda.<ref name=""keydates"">{{NM|P1xiii}}</ref> Following this, the Elves were then found by the [[Vala]] [[Oromë]], who dwelt with them awhile before returning back to [[Valinor]] to bring tidings of his discovery.<ref name=""captivity"" />

Finwë, an Elf of the [[Tatyar]] clan, and a direct descendant of [[Tata]], was born shortly after Oromë's departure. In Oromë's absence, Melkor had his emissaries spread lies among the Elves that the Valar had previously abandoned [[Middle-earth]] and now, jealous to re-posses it, intended to subjugate the Elves as their vassals. Finwë, then a gallant and adventurous young Elf, was much taken with these ideas. Less taken was Finwë's friend [[Elwë]], a descendant of [[Enel]]<ref name=""keydates"" />{{rp|98-99}} who otherwise shared his adventurous spirit.<ref name=""genschemes"">{{NM|P1xvii}}</ref>{{rp|132}}

===Serving as an Ambassador===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe.jpg|thumb|left|''Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
The Valar, both desiring to protect the Elves from the dangers of the world, and filled with the love of their beauty and desiring their companionship, issued a summons inviting the Elves to [[Aman]] and dwell in the light of the [[Two Trees|Two Trees]].<ref name=""captivity"" /> Oromë returned to Cuiviénen with this invite and the [[Three Ambassadors]] — [[Ingwë]], Finwë, and Elwë — were elected from their respective kindreds to first journey with him to Valinor and represent their people. At the time of Finwë's departure he was betrothed to [[Míriel]], an Elf maiden devoted to crafts.<ref name=""keydates"" />{{rp|99}}

On arriving in Valinor, Finwë, like the other Ambassadors, was dazzled and overawed. While he had initially been the most skeptical, he became the most converted, and longed for Míriel to have the marvelous chance of learning new skills. Elwë, though he preferred the “lesser light, and shadows” of [[Endor]], would follow Finwë his friend. The Ambassadors tarried in Valinor for several years, as Ingwë and Finwë were reluctant to hurry away.<ref name=""keydates"" />{{rp|99}}

On the return of the Ambassadors, the Elves held [[Debate of the Quendi|a great debate]] where the Three Ambassadors advocated to relocate to Valinor, while the Three Fathers were against it. Finwë spoke after Ingwë — with less deference towards Tata than Ingwë had showed towards [[Imin]] — and articulated both the riches of knowledge and crafts in Valinor, and the perils of staying in Cuiviénen; he did not, however, disclose his thoughts of the enhancement of his lover Míriel’s skill. Finwë's speech was very effective, as large numbers of the Quendi who could not conceive of Valinor’s attraction were nonetheless frightened of what may befall them if they remained. Elwë declared that he would go with Finwë, but that he chose for none other than himself. After all had finished speaking the Elves held a vote and the majority chose to depart for Valinor, though a very sizable minority chose to remain behind.<ref name=""keydates"" />{{rp|99-105}}<ref group=""note"">This may have included the 144 First Elves, with the Three Fathers among them ({{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 100)</ref>

From this came the first [[sundering of the Elves]]. Those that chose to depart came to be known as the ""[[Eldar]]"", while those that remained became known as ""[[Avari]]"". Among the Eldarin members of the Tatyar clan the name ""[[Noldor]]"" was accepted and used as their regular and proper name throughout their later history.<ref name=""clannames"">{{WJ|C}}</ref>{{rp|507}} Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë were preeminent and obvious leaders: the light of Aman was in their faces and the other Elves were in awe of them.<ref name=""march"">{{NM|P1vii}}</ref>{{rp|62}} Finwë was thereafter known as the first [[king of the Noldor]].<ref>{{NM|Note}}, ""XVI Galadriel and Celeborn"", note 8</ref>

===Great March=== 
{{Main|Great Journey}}
The Eldar thus began their Great Journey and went forth in three hosts, one for each kindred. First came Ingwë's people, the [[Vanyar]]; next were Finwë's, the Noldor; and last were Elwë's, the [[Teleri]]. The Teleri were the greatest host in numbers, and they therefore had a two lords, both Elwë and his younger brother [[Olwë]]. Riding before them all went Oromë.<ref>{{MR|P2g}}, §58</ref>

Over the course of many years the Eldar crossed west through Middle-earth. While there were weddings and begetting of children during the Great March, Finwë was among the few who abstained from doing so as he had seen Aman, and desired to have his children there.<ref name=""march"" />{{rp|62}}

Eventually the Eldar reached the [[Great Sea]], but on beholding it a great fear come upon them, and many withdrew into the woods and highlands of Beleriand.<ref name=""s3"">{{S|3}}</ref> Many of the Noldor dwelt in the forests that were afterwards named [[Neldoreth]] and [[Region]]. During this time Finwë was often visited by Elwë, whose people dwelt further east; on the journey home from one such visit though, Elwë vanished, and his people sought for him in vain.<ref name=""s4"">{{S|4}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§65}}

[[Ulmo]], through the music of [[Ulumúri|his horns]], turned the Eldar's fear of the sea into desire, and both the Vanyar and the Noldor were then ferried over the sea on [[Tol Eressëa|an island]], eventually arriving at Aman.<ref name=""s5"">{{S|5}}</ref>

===Establishment in Aman===
In {{YT|1133}} the Vanyar and Noldor arrived in Aman and took possession of [[Eldamar]] where they began building the green hill of [[Túna]]; upon Túna they then raised the city [[Tirion]].<ref name=""aa3"">{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§67}} By {{YT|1140|n}} Tirion was full-wrought, but Ingwë and many of the Vanyar, yearning for the Light of the Trees, departed to [[Valinor]] to reside with the people of [[Manwë]].<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§68}}

In {{YT|1149|n}} Ulmo hearkened to the prayers of Finwë and went again to Middle-earth to bring Elwë and his people to Aman.<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§70}} By {{YT|1151|n}} Ulmo brought the Teleri, under Olwë their new king, within sight of Aman where at their request he fastened the island Tol Eressëa.<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§72}} Finwë grieved when the Teleri came not, and yet more when he learned that Elwë was forsaken, and knew that he should not see him again unless it were in the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§73}}

In {{YT|1161|n}} the Teleri, drawn towards the Light of Aman, changed their hearts and came to Aman where the Noldor welcomed them with joy<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§75}} and aided them in the building of their city [[Alqualondë]].<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§76}} By {{YT|1165|n}} the last of the Vanyar departed from Tirion, and the Noldor's converse and friendship thereafter was rather with the Teleri of Aman ([[Falmari]]).<ref name=""aa3"" />{{rp|§77}}

=== Birth of Fëanor and death of Míriel ===
In {{YT|1169|n}} Finwë's first child, [[Fëanor]], was born to himself and Míriel.<ref>{{MR|P2k}}, Note 1, p. 101</ref> In the bearing of their son, however, Míriel was so consumed in spirit and body that nearly all her strength seemed to have passed from her. Míriel expressed this to Finwë, stating that she would never again bear child, as the strength that would have nourished many had been spent on Fëanor. Finwë grieved at this, as he desired to bring forth many children into the bliss of Aman. Finwë therefore sought the counsel of Manwë, who then delivered Míriel to the care of [[Irmo]] in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. Finwë was saddened by the departure of Míriel, and that she would miss the childhood days of their son. Míriel went to Lórien and laid down to sleep under a silver tree; there her [[fëa]] departed and passed in silence to the Halls of Mandos.<ref name=""statute"">{{MR|P3II3f}}</ref>

Though many Elves had previously been slain in Middle-earth, and their fëar summoned to Mandos to keep them from the Darkness, Míriel's was the first death in Aman, and it troubled the Valar greatly. Therefore, Manwë consulted directly with [[Ilúvatar]], and from Him received the authority to re-house those among the houseless who so consented.<ref>{{MR|P4q}}</ref>

<!-- Phase 1: Míriel departs, hope remains -->
Yet, Finwë's grief at Míriel's passing remained great, and he often went to the gardens of Lórien to sit beside her body and call to her;<ref name=""statute"" /> and for a while, Fëanor joined his father in vigil by his mother's body.<ref name=""shibboleth"">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> The Valar and all the Eldar, while they grieved Finwë's sorrow, were not dismayed: they believed that all things could be healed in Aman, and that once rested, her fëa and body could be reunited and returned to life.<ref name=""shibboleth"" /> Ingwë, desiring to lift up Finwë's heart and withdraw him from vain mourning in Lórien, sent messages bidding him to leave Túna for a while, and dwell for a season in the full light of the Trees. Finwë thanked him but did not go, as he yet hoped that Míriel would return.<ref name=later_fm>{{MR|P3II4}}</ref>

<!-- Phase 2: Finwë focuses on Fëanor -->
[[File:Steamey - Finwë Mourning Míriel.jpg|thumb|right|''Finwë Mourning Míriel'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]
But Míriel was reluctant, and to all the pleas reported to her, and to the counsels of the Valar, she would say no more than ""not yet"". Each time she was approached, however, she became more determined, until at last she would listen no more and declared to leave her in peace where she was, and that she would not return.<ref name=""shibboleth"" /> After a while Finwë went to Lórien no more, for it only increased his grief to see the fair form of Míriel that would not hear his call. All of Finwë's love was then given to his son, for Fëanor in childhood was like Míriel in voice and countenance, and Finwë was to him both father and mother, and there was a double bond of love between them.<ref name=later_fm />

<!-- Phase 3: Finwë seeks healing -->
Yet Finwë, being young and eager and desiring more children, was not content. Therefore, after a few years, Finwë again spoke to Manwë of his bereavement. He exclaimed that he alone among the Eldar had no wife, and could hope for no more children save the one son, while both Ingwë and Olwë had begat many children in the bliss of Aman.<ref name=later_fm /> Finwë then asked if he must remain ever thus, for his heart warned him that Míriel would not return, and if there was not healing of ''his'' grief in Aman.<ref name=""statute"" />

Manwë was moved with pity for Finwë, but the coming of death and such sorrow into Aman was of grave portent, and he thus summoned the Valar to council where they held a [[Debate of the Valar|great debate]] on the issue which resulted in the making of the [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel]]. This Statute declared that if one spouse died and refused to be reembodied, then after a set number of years the living spouse would be permitted to remarry and the deceased spouse would forever forfeit their ability to return. Manwë then called Finwë back before him and informed him of this, but noted that while Finwë would have permission to remarry if Míriel did not return, it was not counsel to do so. Finwë responded that he was in no haste, and only desired that once the doom was made clear to Míriel she would relent and set a term to his bereavement. Míriel was informed of this doom, but she maintained her desire to never return: her life had gone out into Fëanor, and she believed healing was not possible within Arda.<ref name=later_fm />

<!-- Phase 4: Fëanor drifts away -->
In the following years, Fëanor dwelt in the care of Finwë and began to display the skills in hand and mind of both his parents. In stature he became ever more like Finwë, but in mood he resembled Míriel as his will was strong and determined;<ref name=later_fm /> also like her, he could also become wholly absorbed in his works and devices, and he thus provided little comfort to the sorrow of Finwë.<ref name=""shibboleth"" /> 

<!-- Phase 5: Finwë takes back up his life -->
By {{YT|1182|n}}, the span of years prescribed by the Statue had passed, and the doom of disunion was spoken.<ref name=later_fm /> It thus became clear at last to Finwë that Míriel would never return within any span of time that could give him hope, and his sorrow became embittered. He sought to take up his own life again, and wandered far and wide, but in his loneliness he found no joy in anything that he did.<ref name=""shibboleth"" />

=== Remarriage to Indis ===
[[File:Alystraea_-_Finwe_and_Indis.jpg|right|thumb|''Finwe and Indis'' by [[Alystraea]]]]
Two years later, in {{YT|1184|n}}, Finwë, reconsidering Ingwë's offer, thought that perhaps healing might be found in the light of [[Laurelin]] and hope in the blossom of [[Telperion]], and decided to seek Ingwë's council. 

On a day, while Fëanor was abroad walking in the mountains, Finwë, travelling alone, passed through the [[Calacirian]], and towards the house of Ingwë upon the west slopes of [[Oiolossë]]. His coming was unheralded, and as he climbed the paths of the Mountain, he heard the joyous singing of [[Indis]], kinswoman of Ingwë, and he looked up and beheld her, face lit by the the golden light of Laurelin. In that moment he then knew that she loved him, and had long done so, and his heart turned to her. This, he deemed was a chance that had been granted to them both, and he declared that there was indeed healing of grief in Aman.<ref name=later_fm /> 

In {{YT|1185|n}}, one year from their meeting, Finwë and Indis were wed. Finwë loved her dearly, and was glad again, and together they had four additional children: [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], [[Irimë]], and [[Finarfin]]. Yet, the shadow of Míriel remained in both Finwë's house, and in his heart.<ref name=later_fm /> 

For Fëanor, the matter of Finwë and Indis was met with anger and resentment: by their marriage Míriel, who he loved dearly, was now condemned to never return, and he to never see or visit her again. Fëanor thus grudged the happiness of Finwë and Indis, and disliked their children before they were even born.<ref name=""shibboleth"" /> As soon as he could, Fëanor lived apart from them: exploring the land of Aman, or busying himself with lore and crafts.<ref name=later_fm />

The estrangement between Fëanor and Indis and her children did not lessen the love between Finwë and Fëanor however; indeed, of all whom Finwë loved, Fëanor had ever the chief share of his thought.<ref name=later_fm />

===Unrest of the Noldor===
{{main|Unrest of the Noldor}}
For a time, the Noldor continued to dwell in Aman in happiness. The craftsmen of the Noldor worked with delight, foreseeing no end to their labours, while Fëanor became of all them, then or after, the most subtle in mind and the most skilled in hand. Finwë's sons by Indis likewise grew to their full stature.<ref name=s_feanor>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> During this happy time Finwë's house expanded greatly, with many grandchildren through the [[House of Fëanor]] (including Fëanor's unprecedented [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]]), the [[House of Fingolfin]], and the [[House of Finarfin]].

In {{YT|1400|n}}, after three ages of imprisonment, the [[Chaining of Melkor]] was ended and he was [[Unchaining of Melkor|granted freedom]] by Manwë.<ref name=AA4>{{MR|P2j}}</ref>{{rp|§87-88}} Though he feigned repentance, Melkor despised the Elves, and sought to estrange them from the Valar.<ref name=s_feanor /> And of the Elves, Melkor despised Fëanor most, and lusted after his great creations, the [[Silmaril]]s. Long and slow, Melkor gradually inflamed the Noldor with pride and jealousy, with visions of mighty realms to be had in Middle-earth, and of their supposed usurpation by [[Men]] who were more easily controlled by the Valar.<ref name=s_unrest>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

Though Fëanor hated and took no counsel from Melkor, in him burned most fiercely the desire for freedom and wide-realms by returning to Middle-earth. Seeing that both Fëanor and Fingolfin had grown proud and jealous of their rights and possessions, Melkor set new lies against them. To Fëanor, whispers came that Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to usurp Finwë, and the elder line of Fëanor, by leave of the Valar who were ill-pleased that Fëanor's Silmarils had not been committed to their keeping. To Fingolfin and Finarfin, however, it was said that Fëanor, having become great, bore little love for the children of Indis, and with Finwë in his hand, was making ready to drive them forth from Túna.<ref name=TSP6>{{MR|P3II6}}</ref>{{rp|§52}}

With pride and anger thus awakened, the houses of the Noldor began to quarrel and vie with one another. Melkor then spoke to them of weapons, which the Noldor secretly began to smith. In this time, Fëanor began to speak openly of rebellion against the Valar, and of delivering the Noldor from thralldom by returning to Middle-earth.<ref name=s_unrest />

Amidst this unrest, Finwë grew concerned, and called a great council of all his lords. Fingolfin, arriving before the council began, spoke to Finwë and urged him to restrain Fëanor, and that if Finwë did not repent leading the Noldor to Aman, he still had at least two sons who honoured that. At this moment however, Fëanor suddenly appeared, fully armed, and rebuked Fingolfin before drawing his sword and demanding him to go. As Fingolfin left, Fëanor followed him and at the door of the king's house publicly threatened him at sword-point; as Finwë's house was in the [[Great Square]], these words were heard by many.<ref name=s_unrest />

[[File:Irsanna_-_Finwe_in_Formenos.jpg|right|thumb|''Finwe in Formenos'' by [[Irsanna]]]]
Wroth at these deeds, Manwë summoned Fëanor, along with all others who had any part in the unrest, to the [[Ring of Doom]] to stand before Mandos. After all testimony had been given, Melkor's role became apparent, and [[Tulkas]] was sent to retrieve him. Fëanor was not held guiltless though, and he was banished from Túna for twelve years. Fëanor thus departed to [[Formenos]] where he was joined by [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]] as well as by Finwë, who would not be parted from him.<ref name=s_unrest /> The rule of the Noldor who remained in Tirion was then committed to Fingolfin by Manwë.<ref name=""MR22"">{{MR|P3II3e}}, note 22</ref>

After two years Melkor, who had hidden himself, came secretly to Formenos, disguised as a traveller seeking lodging, and spoke with Fëanor before his door. Melkor feigned friendship and urged Fëanor to his former thoughts of flight, but then overreached when he spoke of the Silmarils, causing Fëanor to turn him away and shut the door in his face. Finwë was filled with great dread on learning of this, and in haste sent messengers to Manwë.<ref name=TSP6/>{{rp|§54}}

===Death and aftermath===
Seeking to heal the griefs between the lords of the Noldor, Manwë prepared a [[High_feast#High_feast_of_1495|great high feast]] for all to join. To Formenos he sent a messenger specifically bidding the attendance of Fëanor, which Fëanor interpreted as a command, and thus he went.<ref>{{MR|P3II7}}</ref>{{rp|§58c}} Along with the sons of Fëanor, Finwë refused the invitation, saying that ""while the ban lasts upon Fëanor my son, that he may not go to Túna, I hold myself unkinged, and will not meet my people, nor those that rule in my stead"".<ref>{{MR|P2j}}</ref>{{rp|§112}}

After the departure of Fëanor, Finwë was heavy with grief, and a foreboding was upon him. Soon, Melkor, along with [[Ungoliant]], assaulted Formenos, enveloping it as a black cloud. While all others fled, Finwë remained and stood alone defiant against them, and was slain; his head was crushed though with a great mace of iron, his body burned and destroyed, and his sword twisted and untempered as if by lightning-stroke.<ref>{{MR|P3II8}}</ref>{{rp|§§9-10}}<ref group=note>Christopher Tolkien notes that the two accounts of Finwë's death ""may not be death altogether contradictory, for in the present text Maedros speaks of seeing a sudden flame out of the Cloud of Ungoliantë, followed by ‘one piercing cry’, and of finding Finwë’s sword ‘twisted and untempered as if by lightning-stroke’."" - {{MR|P3II9a}}, commentary, §10</ref>

In the subsequent [[flight of the Noldor]], the slaying of Finwë was a key motivator in their decision to depart from Aman. During [[Speech of Fëanor|Fëanor's speech]] he declared that he ''""would not dwell longer in the same land with the kin of my father’s slayer""'',<ref>{{MR|Speech}}</ref>{{rp|§132}} while Fingolfin, prior to Fëanor's theft of the ships, stated that he had ''""an errand in Middle-earth, the avenging of the blood of my father upon Morgoth, whom the Valar let loose among us.""''<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}</ref>{{rp|33}}

In the unhappy events which latter came to pass, many judged that if Finwë had endured the loss of Míriel and been content with the fathering of his mighty son Fëanor, then Fëanor's courses would have been different, and much sorrow and evil would not have been.<ref name=later_fm/>{{rp|§28}}

===Forfeiture of return===
After Finwë's death, his fëa departed to Mandos where he met again with Míriel. Míriel was glad of the meeting, but moved to sadness once she learned all that had transpired since her departure. She accepted that she erred in leaving Finwë and Fëanor, or at least in not returning soon after a brief repose, and bore no grudge against Indis for cherishing what she had abandoned. Míriel then expressed a desire to return to her body, and record the deeds of their people, including Finwë and his children, into tapestry.<ref name=""p3ii3d"">{{MR|P3II3d}}, pp. 248-9</ref>

Finwë then went to [[Vairë]] and requested Míriel be returned to life, offering instead for he himself to forever remain in Mandos in her place. When Vairë remarked that Finwë seemed to now be considering Míriel only, and to have forgotten about Indis and his children with her, Finwë retorted that was unjust; he was able to love two women without the love for one diminishing the love for the other. Additionally, he stated that he had been apart from Indis for many years, that her love was now mostly for Fingolfin, and that most of all she longed to return to the peace of the Vanyar and be away from the strife of the Noldor.<ref name=""p3ii3d"" />

When Mandos was approached he declared Finwë making this offer of his own free will a counsel of healing, and consented to Míriel's return with Finwë's abnegation as her ransom. On waking, Míriel entered the House of Vairë and became her chief handmaid, and there recorded all tidings of the Noldor into great tapestries. Of these Finwë was at times permitted to look upon.<ref name=""p3ii3d"" />

==Characteristics==
[[File:Quentandil - Finwe device.png|right|thumb|''Finwe device'' by [[User:Quentandil|Quentandil]]]]
Finwë had black hair and brilliant grey-blue eyes.<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}</ref>{{rp|19}}

In his youth, before becoming King of the Noldor, Finwë was gallant and adventurous, but also rebellious and independent. Before serving as an ambassador, he had ""heretical"" leanings and was much taken by the lies of Melkor that the Valar had, rightly, previously abandoned Endor as the appointed realm of the Quendi, but became jealous and sought to re-posses it and to control the Quendi as their vassals. Once he arrived in Valinor, however, he was dazzled and overawed, and thus became the most converted and ardent for accepting the invitation of the Valar to dwell there.<ref name=""keydates"" />

He became known as the ""wisest of all the children of the world"".<ref name=""mrcoming"">{{MR|P3I3}}</ref>{{rp|§26}}

When Indis's heart had turned towards Finwë, in the days when the Vanyar still dwelt at Tirion, ""he seemed to her fairest and noblest of the Eldar, dark-haired and white of brow, eager of face but with eyes full of thought; and his voice and mastery of words delighted her.""<ref name=later_fm/>{{rp|§24}}

==Etymology==
'''Finwë''', is one of the oldest recorded names of the Eldar, and it is not certain that it had any meaning beyond the stem ''""fin-""'' followed by the suffix ''""[[-wë]]""''.<ref name=""finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|419}}

The second element was explained by [[loremaster]]s as an old word for 'person', derived from the stem <code>√EWE</code>, but survived in Quenya only as a final element in names. The first element (fin-) was often later explained as related to [[Common Eldarin]] <code>√PHIN</code> (""hair""), as in [[Quenya]] ''finë'' (""a hair""), ''findë'' (""hair"", especially of the head), ''finda'' (""having hair"", ""-haired""), but it was doubtful. All the Eldar had beautiful hair, but the Noldor were not specially remarkable in this respect, and there is no reference to Finwë as having had hair of exceptional length, abundance, or beauty beyond the measure of his people.<ref name=""finwe"" />{{rp|419}} 

Alternatively, <code>√PHIN</code> has the meaning of [(""clever"", ""fine"", ""delicate""), (""nimbleness"", ""skill""), or (""skilful"", ""neat"", ""clever"")].<ref name=""pe17"">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|181}} With this interpretation, Finwë is defined as ""man of manual skill"".<ref name=""pe17"" />{{rp|17}} 

""fin"" having meanings of both ""skill"" and ""hair"" may be explained by <code>√SPIN</code> [(""fine thread"", ""filament"") or (""a single hair"")], being distinct, though probably ultimately connected, from <code>√PHIN</code>, and eventually itself becoming ""phin-"" in Quenya.<ref name=""pe17"" />{{rp|17}}

In the [[Qenya Lexicon]] (QL) the root <code>FINI</code> is used in ''finwa'' (""acute"", ""sagacious""); ''finië'' and ''findë'' (""cunning""); and ''fint'' (""a trick"", ""notion""). These are provided to be compared with ""Finwë"".<ref name=""pe12"">{{PE|12}}</ref>{{rp|38}}

Being king of the Noldor, Finwë was styled as '''''Ñoldóran''''',<ref name=""Descendants""/> which is a compound of ''[[noldo|Ñoldo]]'' and ''[[aran]]'' 'king', where ''o''+''a'' assimilated into a long ''ó''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3561596031.html|articlename=Q. ''Ñoldóran'' pn.|website=Eldamo|accessed=12 October 2025}}</ref>

==Other names==
In the ''[[Book of Lost Tales]]'', the lord of the [[Noldoli]] was '''Finwë Nólemë''' (also '''Nólemë Finwë''', and most commonly simply '''Nólemë''')<ref name=""ltcoming"">{{LT1|Vn}}</ref>{{rp|168}}. In QL, ''Nólemë'' is defined as (""deep lore"", ""wisdom"").<ref name=""pe12"" />{{rp|67}} His name in Gnomish was initially '''Golfinweg''', then '''Fingolma''', and they are noted as containing the same elements.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry for '''Nólemë'''</ref> 

The name of Fëanor's father (a separate character from the King of the Noldoli) was initially '''Bruithwir''' which was emended from '''Maron'''.<ref>{{LT1|VIn}}</ref> The character also had a second name, '''Felegron''', which was emended to '''Feleor'''.<ref>{{LT2|Index}}, entry for '''Felegron'''</ref>

In ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]'' he is given a Gnomish cognate of '''Finn'''.<ref>{{SM|Index}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', '''Finwë Nólemë''' was the lord of the [[Noldoli]], though he was called ''Golfinweg'' in [[Gnomish]]. He was one of the [[Eru-begotten|first awakened Elves]], and when [[Nornorë]], herald of the Valar, bid for a few of them to come to Valinor, Finwë was one of the three who came forward. In Valinor, the three Elves were ""utterly dazed and astonied"" by the splendor of the lights of the Two Trees, and bowed in reverence. When Manwë then asked of them from where they came to the world, and what desires it filled them with, Nólemë responded ""Lo! Most mighty one, whence indeed come we! For meseems I awoke but now from a sleep eternally profound, whose vast dreams already are forgotten"". He then returns to his people and leads them to Valinor, on the second ferrying of the island after the Teleri (Vanyar) took the first.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref>

When Melko began to sow discord among the Gnomes, Nólemë spoke against him in efforts to calm their restlessnes and discontents. Eventually he took council with Fëanor (a great craftsman, not his son), Inwë (Ingwë), and Ellu Melemno (Olwë) and decided to send an embassy to Manwë on the matter; when his embassy arrived however, Melko was already there, having spoken to Manwë and giving a false account before they arrived. Manwë chided both parties: to Melko he bid to dwell in penitence in Mandos; and to the Gnomes, ""fearing lest the pollution of their discontent spread among the other kindreds"", he banished from their city of [[Kôr]] to new dwellings further away. Following this, Melko first used the [[Feast of Double Mirth]] as an opportunity to steal the [[Silmarils]], murdering Fëanor's father Bruithwir in the process, and then, with Gloomweaver (Ungoliant), slew the Two Trees.<ref>{{LT1|VI}}</ref>

After the darkening of Valinor, Fëanor was able to rally the Gnomes to follow him in departing. Nólemë spoke against this rashness and, when his people wouldn't hear him, he pleaded to at least send an embassy to Manwë for due farewell and perhaps receive goodwill and council; even this ""moderate wisdom"", however, Fëanor turned the Gnomes against. Even though he was unable to persuade his people through council, Nólemë would not be separated from them, and aided them in all their preparations. The Noldoli then departed Kôr, stole ships from the [[Solosimpi]] (Falmari), and crossed the [[Helcaraxë|frozen wastes in the north]] to reach the Great Lands.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}</ref>

In earlier outlines of ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes'' the Noldoli then encamped at the [[Waters of Asgon]] (Lake Mithrim), and Nólemë (now also known as ''Fingolma'') begot his son '''Turundo''' (''Turgon'' in Gnomish), who was was born to 'prophecies'. In one version, Nólemë perished when his small boat vanished down a hidden-way as he was sailing to an islanded rock in Asgon to offer sacrifice (it is not said to whom he was sacrificing). In an emended version, Nólemë's host left Asgon, fought with the Orcs, and then encamped at [[Sirion]] where they met the [[Ilkorins]]. When the hosts of Melko approached, the Noldoli retreated to Gorfalon (Valley of the Fountains) where they made the acquaintance of Men and, after sending embassies to [[Túvo]], [[Tinwelint]] (Thingol), and [[Ermon]], Fingolma marshalled a great host. Melko, however, beguiled many of the Men, and they abandoned or betrayed the Elves, resulting in ""the terrible [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]"". While Nólemë's fate is not explicitly stated, it's implied he was slain as his son Turgon escaped and quarrelled with the Sons of Fëanor for leadership.<ref name=lt1x>{{LT1|X}}</ref>

In later outlines of ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes'' the Noldoli bested the Orcs in their first battle with them, capturing the pass of the [[Bitter Hills]], and escaping from the [[Land of Shadows]]. They entered the Forest of Artanor (Doriath) and the  Region of the Great Plains and Nólemë's host grew to a vast size. Their chief camp was about Sirion and they drove the Orcs into the foothills of the Iron Mountains. Melko suborned many Men and, in the ensuing Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Nólemë was isolated, slain, and the Orcs cut out his heart; Turgon however rescued Nólemë's body and recaptured his heart. When the Sons of Fëanor eventually arrived they found a stricken field; they buried the body of Nólemë and erected the greatest cairn in the world over it, called by the Gnomes the [[Hill of Death]].<ref name=lt1x /> Turgon later took his heart, encased it in gold, and took it [[Scarlet Heart|for his emblem]]<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>{{rp|note 11}}

Prior to his death Fingolma, as well as the Sons of Fëanor, favoured Eöl because he was the leader of the Miners and searched after hidden jewels; Eöl loved from afar Fingolma's daughter Isfin, though she in return loathed him.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>

===Later versions===
In the ''[[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales]]'', '''Gelmir''' is the King of the Gnomes. He led his people back to the Great Lands, with his three sons — Golfin, [[Delin]], and [Oleg >] [[Lúthien (son of Gelmir)|Lúthien]] — each captaining one of his armies.<ref>{{SM|P2}}</ref>

In ''[[Ælfwine]]’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names'', Finwë has a fourth child named, in Old English, ""[[Finrún]] Felageómor"".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

In rejected emendations to ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', Finwe's wife, Indis, bore him a son, Fëanor, during the Great March while in a forest near the [[Anduin]] in Middle-earth; Fëanor was the first Elf-child to be born via parents (vs awakened by Eru).<ref name=""aa3""/>{{rp|note 3}} When the Noldor soon after crossed the Misty Mountains, Indis fell into a deep gorge and perished; Finwë would then not go forward until Oromë told him of Elvish reincarnation in Aman, at which point Finwë was eager to continue.<ref name=""aa3""/>{{rp|note 5}}

In ''The Earliest Version of the Story of Finwë and Míriel'', Finwë and Indis have ''five'' children as they have a third daughter: [[Faniel]].<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}</ref>

In ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', multiple considerations for key dates of Finwë's life are considered. As Tolkien fluctuated between different year lengths, when years are preceded by ""VY"" (Valian Years) that corresponds to [[yén]] (each being 144 solar years) after the creation of the trees; when preceded by ""FA"" (First Age), that corresponds to löa after the Elves awoke.

In ''Aging of Elves'', Finwë awakened around VY 1050, the Finding (when the Elves were found by Oromë) in 1085, and Finwë wedded Míriel somewhere about 1150.<ref>{{NM|P1ix}}</ref>{{rp|80}}

In ''Key Dates: Text 2A'',<ref group=""note"">This text precedes ''Text 1'' from the same section</ref> the Finding was in FA 864 and Oromë departed back to Valinor in 912; he returned briefly between 1008-1018, and again in 1058 to invite the Three Ambassadors. Finwë was either the grandson or great-great-grandson of Tata, and born in either FA 1100 or 1022.<ref name=""keydates"" />

In ''Key Dates: Text 1'', the Finding was in FA 2016 and Oromë departed back to Valinor in 2064. Finwë was a 25th generation descendent of Tata and born in 2120.<ref group=note>In this reckoning, each [[Valian Year]] is equivalent to 144 solar years. The ""/104"" denotes an additional 104 solar years after the start of VY 865. The year 2120 isn't a direct conversion from ""VY 865/104"", but a reference to solar years since the start of the First Age with [[Awakening of the Elves]] in VY 850.</ref> He accompanied Oromë as an Ambassador in 2212. A brief consideration was also for Imin, Tata, and Enel to be the Three Ambassadors; and for Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë to join them as assistants and representatives of the younger Elves.<ref name=""keydates"" />

In ''Generational Schemes: Text 3: Scheme 2'', Finwë was a 6th generation and born in FA 772. The Finding was in 864, and the Great March in 1070. At the time of the March, he already loved Míriel, and would have married around 1084 if he hadn't postponed until its end.<ref name=""genschemes"" />

In ''Generational Schemes: Text 3: Scheme 3'', the Finding was in FA 2016. Finwë was a 25th generation and born in 2120. The Embassy was in 2212. Míriel, also in the 25th generation, was born around 2130; and Indis (the first child of Ingwë) was born in 2181.<ref name=""genschemes"" />

{{quote|Míriel was the name of his mother, who was called Serindë, because of her surpassing skill in weaving and needlework; for her hands were more skilled to fineness than any hands even among the Noldor.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor]]""}}

'''Míriel Þerindë''', also spelled '''Serindë''', was the first wife of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]]. Her son was [[Curufinwë]], whom she called [[Fëanor|Fëanáro]], which means ""Spirit of Fire"". Miriel's hair was described as being silver in appearance, an unusual colour for one of the [[Noldor]].

==History==
Míriel was born in [[Cuiviénen]] and it is said that already there she was the lover of [[Finwë]] of the [[Tatyar]], and was devoted to crafts. Finwë was one of the three ambassadors, who on behalf of the Tatyar went to the Blessed Realm and invite the other [[Elves]] there. One wish for him to relocate the Elves to Valinor was the ability for Míriel to learn new skills.<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 99-102</ref>

After the [[Great Journey]] from Cuiviénen to Aman, Míriel lived in the blessed realm, in the hill city of [[Tirion]] on [[Túna]], together with her husband [[Finwë]], King of the [[Noldor]]. Her hands were skilled in the shaping of fine things, and she was unsurpassed in weaving and needlework.
[[File:Francesco Amadio - Miriel and Feanaro.jpg|thumb|left|''Míriel and Feanáro'' by [[:Category:Images by Francesco Amadio|Francesco Amadio]]]]
There was much love between Míriel and Finwë, and even more for her son, but after giving birth to [[Fëanor]] in {{YT|1169}},<ref name=""Fourth"">{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 205</ref> her body and spirit were consumed and she wished to be released from life everlasting, saying that there was no strength left in her to bear another child. Despite Finwë's grief, and her unhappiness at abandoning her young child, Míriel departed for the gardens of [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]], to rest and regain her strength and vigour. But during her rest, the [[Fëa and hröa|fëa]] departed from her body, and entered the [[Halls of Mandos]] leaving her body lying lifeless and still in {{YT|1170}}.<ref name=""Fourth"" /> Maidens of [[Estë]] took care of her body while her spirit remained in the Halls of Mandos, so that it would not wither. In essence, she had died of free will. This was seen as a shocking event by the [[Valar]] and [[Eldar]] which had never before occurred.<ref name=""Feanor"">{{S|Feanor}}</ref>

But Finwë was in grief, and felt ashamed being the only Elf in Aman without a wife. [[Manwë]] summoned the Valar in Council, and the result was the '[[Statute of Finwë and Míriel]]', which only allowed re-marriage if the dead spouse refused to be re-embodied. [[Vairë]] told Míriel of this and of the sorrow of Finwë, but Míriel refused to come back to life. In words of Vairë: ""''[The spirit of Míriel] is small, but it is strong and obdurate: one of those who having said ''this will I do'' make their words a law irrevocable unto themselves''"". However, [[Mandos]] summoned the spirit of Míriel and warned her that she could not change her will with the time, living in grievance till the end of Arda. But Míriel remained silent and Mandos accepted her choice.<ref>{{MR|P3II4}}, pp. 258-260</ref>

Years later, Finwë knew this doom, being allowed to marry again, having many other children with [[Indis]]. Fëanor was resentful of her, and observed her influence on Finwë, including his speech which started to resemble [[Vanyarin|that of the Vanyar]] and considered it a disrespect against his mother.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />{{rp|336}}

After the deaths of Finwë and Fëanor, the former couple were reunited in the Halls of Mandos. Meeting Finwë again, Míriel felt lightened from her sadness and released of her reluctant will. She spoke to him [[Ósanwe|through thought]], apologizing of her errors and promising to weave a tapestry about his people and children. Seeing that Míriel wished to come back to life, Finwë asked Vairë to allow it, while he would remain in the Halls of Mandos till the end of Arda with his son Fëanor. Mandos accepted this, and Míriel's spirit was released and went to her body in Lórien. Then she awoke again like from a dream, and was refreshed.

However, she was still sad and did not wish to come back with her people, so she went to the House of Vairë, being the only living creature to live there. She became the handmaid of Vairë, and fulfilled her promise, weaving historical webs telling the deeds of the Noldor.<ref name=""Reborn"">{{MR|P3II3d}}, pp. 248-250</ref>

==Etymology==
''Míriel'' is [[Quenya]], but it is not glossed. As Paul Strack explains, it can mean ""Jewel-daughter"", being a combination of ''[[mír]]'' (""jewel"") + ''[[-iel]]'' (""daughter"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2932147137.html|articlename=Q. ''Míriel (Míriell-)'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=30 October 2021}}</ref> 

==Other names==
Her [[mother-name]] '''''Þerindë''''' (also pronounced ''Serindë''), means ""the Broideress"", referring to her great skill in embroidery for 'her chief talent was a marvelous dexterity of hand', which she applied to her skill of embroidery, 'achieving in what even the Eldar thought haste' embroidery that 'was finer and more intricate than any that had before been seen'.<ref name=""Shibboleth"">{{PM|Case}}</ref>{{rp|333}} It is to be noted that she preferred and requested her kin use the older pronunciation of ''Þerindë'', and that her son upheld the use of ''Þ'' over ''s'' out of respect and in her memory.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />{{rp|336}}

After coming back to life, she was renamed '''''Fíriel''''' (""She that died"" or ""She that sighed""). Till her death, Elves had no words for natural death, so they used the term ''fírë'' (""expire"") because Míriel had sighed a deep breath in the moment of death. The term was associated with death, being used for the [[Gift of Men|death of Men]].<ref name=""Reborn"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the beginning of ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', Fëanor is an adult, and Míriel is still alive. There the similarities between mother and son, such as their stubbornness, are revealed. Fëanor's reaction to his mother's death is also presented, as he guarded her [[hröa]], which was placed in a garden, for some time after her passing.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" /> In the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', Míriel died soon after his birth.<ref name=""Feanor"" />

==History==
===Early life===
Aragorn was born in {{TA|2931}} to the Chieftain Arathorn II and received the name Aragorn. His grandmother, [[Ivorwen]], noted with [[foresight]] that Aragorn would one day wear on his breast a green stone.<ref>{{PM|Foreword}}</ref>

A legend says that the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] had brought such a stone, called the [[Elfstone|Elessar]], from [[Valinor]]. He gave the Elessar to the [[Elves|Elven]] Lady [[Galadriel]] and remarked prophetically that she would pass it to another, who will also be called Elessar.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref> From this would come Aragorn's royal name ''Elessar'' ([[Quenya]] for ""Elfstone"").
[[File:Anna Kulisz - Elrond and Estel.jpg|thumb|left|''Elrond and Estel'' by [[:Category:Images by Anna Kulisz|Anna Kulisz]]]]
When Aragorn was two years old, his father was slain when an [[Orcs|Orc]] arrow pierced his eye. As was the tradition of his people, Aragorn was fostered in [[Rivendell]] by [[Elrond]] as if he were his own son. The [[Wise]] decided that his identity was to be kept secret, as the last [[Heir of Isildur]] would be vulnerable to [[Sauron|the Enemy]]. Aragorn was called '''''[[Estel]]''''' ([[Sindarin]] for ""Hope"") instead. During his youth in Rivendell he accompanied the twin sons of Elrond, [[Elrohir]] and [[Elladan]], on their journeys.<ref name=""Tale"" />

""Estel"" grew to be fair and noble, and was seemingly more mature than his age. When Aragorn was twenty-one years old, after returning from a journey with the [[Elladan and Elrohir|twins]] in {{TA|2952}}, Elrond decided to reveal his true name and ancestry. As part of this revelation, Elrond delivered to him the heirlooms of [[House of Isildur|his House]]: the shards of [[Narsil]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]. Elrond also said that he should earn the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]]. The next day, full of hope, Aragorn was sitting in the forest singing a part of the ''[[Lay of Leithian|Lay of Lúthien]]''; as he sang of the meeting [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], [[Arwen]], daughter of Elrond, who had newly returned from [[Lothlórien]], appeared to him. Aragorn thought that Lúthien herself had appeared and fell in love.<ref name=""Tale"" />

===Life as a Ranger===
Estel took up his proper name as Aragorn, sixteenth of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain, and after he took leave of his mother and Elrond he went into [[The Wild]].<ref name=""Tale"" /> In {{TA|2953}} he was not present in Rivendell for the last meeting of the [[White Council]]. Aragorn met [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] in {{TA|2956}}, and they became great friends.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref> At Gandalf's advice he started to become interested in [[the Shire]] and became known as '''''Strider''''' in this region.
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Ecthelion,Thorongil and Boromir study.jpg|thumb|left|''""Thorongil"" with Ecthelion II'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]
From {{TA|2957}} to {{TA|2980}} Aragorn took great journeys aiding the [[West]] against [[Sauron]] and his allies. After serving King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], he went to [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] of [[Gondor]],<ref name=""TA"" /> who was in dire need of able men to guard his realm from [[Mordor]]. Aragorn kept his identity secret but as he wore a silver star upon his cloak, and was swift and keen-eyed, the [[Gondorians]] called him '''''Thorongil''''' (Sindarin for ""Eagle of the Star""). He was a great leader by land and sea and Ecthelion trusted and loved him most. Some believed that there was rivalry between him and the Steward's son, [[Denethor]], who probably knew his identity as [[Heir of Isildur]], and suspected that he and Gandalf worked to supplant him. Thorongil, however, saw himself only as the servant of the [[Steward of Gondor|Steward]], whom he advised to not trust [[Saruman]] and instead to welcome Gandalf (whom Denethor didn't trust or love).<ref name=appstewards>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Ecthelion was anticipating an attack from Sauron, who had just returned, and Thorongil warned him that in that event the [[Southern Fiefs]] would be vulnerable to the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. He was allowed by Ecthelion to take a few ships and lead an [[Surprise attack on Umbar|attack against Umbar]]; at night he burned many ships, and in a fight, slew the [[Captain of the Haven]] with only few casualties. Great honour awaited him in [[Minas Tirith]] but he did not return; while in [[Pelargir]], he sent a farewell message to Ecthelion, speaking of other tasks calling him, and saying that fate would not bring him again to Gondor soon. To the grief and wonder of his companions he crossed the [[Anduin]] and was last seen staring at the [[Ephel Dúath]].<ref name=appstewards/> He left Gondor to travel into the far East and South ""exploring the hearts of men good and evil"" and learning about the ""plots and devices"" of the servants of the Dark Lord.<ref name=Tale/> His exploits ensured the survival of the [[West]] much later during the [[War of the Ring]].

[[File:Stephen Hickman - Aragorn and Arwen.jpg|thumb|left|''Aragorn and Arwen'' by [[Stephen Hickman]]]]
Later in {{TA|2980}} on his return to Rivendell he entered [[Lothlórien]], and there once again met Arwen in [[Caras Galadhon]]. For one season they wandered together in Lothlórien. At midsummer, he gave her the heirloom of his House, the [[Ring of Barahir]], and Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage.<ref name=""Tale"" />

Elrond gave his foster son permission to marry his daughter, on the condition that he must first become king of both Gondor and Arnor, for only a king would be worthy of Arwen's hand.<ref name=""Tale"" /> This harsh condition had a precedent: King [[Thingol]]'s request that [[Beren]] obtain a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from [[Morgoth]] before marrying his daughter [[Lúthien]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Hunt for Gollum===
In the year {{TA|3001}}, as a now revealed [[Sauron]] continued to regain power in [[Mordor]], Aragorn began assisting [[Gandalf]] in his search for news of [[Gollum]]. Gandalf suspected that the ring [[Bilbo Baggins]] found near Gollum's lake was in fact [[the One Ring]].<ref name=TA/> In {{TA|3007}}, he briefly returned to [[Eriador]], where he visited his mother for the last time. She died before that year's spring.<ref name=Tale/>

In {{TA|3009}} Gandalf and Aragorn renewed their hunt for Gollum, searching intermittently in the [[vales of Anduin]], [[Mirkwood]], and [[Rhovanion]], even to the confines of [[Mordor]], without knowing that around that time Gollum ventured into Mordor, and was captured by Sauron.<ref name=""TA"" /> [[Third Age 3017|After eight years]] Gollum was released and Aragorn finally overtook him in the [[Dead Marshes]]<ref name=""TA"" /> on [[1 February]]. With Gollum, he travelled through the northern [[Emyn Muil]], to prevent being found by Sauron's spies, and crossed the Anduin at the [[Sarn Gebir]]. He travelled further north along the edges of [[Fangorn Forest]] and through Lothlórien,<ref name=""UT"">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> where the Elves sent a message to Gandalf.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, Note 5</ref> He travelled alongside the Anduin to the north until he arrived at the [[Carrock]]. With the aid of the [[Beornings]] he crossed the Anduin with Gollum and entered [[Mirkwood]]. He took Gollum to [[Thranduil]] to be held captive.<ref name=""TA"" /><ref name=""UT"" /> He then returned west where he met with Gandalf at [[Sarn Ford]] and learned of [[Frodo Baggins]]' plan to leave the Shire with the Ring in late September. Aragorn then continued his own journey.<ref name=""Strider"">{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

===The War of the Ring===
When Aragorn returned to his area, the [[Wandering Companies|Wandering Company]] of [[Elves]] who followed [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] told Aragorn the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] had been seen, Gandalf had been missing and there were no messages from him. Aragorn and his [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] kept watch over the border of [[the Shire]] and the [[East Road]] waiting for sight of Frodo but there was no news of them leaving [[Buckland]].<ref name=""Strider"" />

While staying in [[Bree]], Aragorn crossed the paths of four [[Shire-hobbits]] in [[The Prancing Pony]]. Aragorn watched as the hobbits clumsily hid their names and intentions, and as [[Frodo Baggins]], the leader of the party, fell from a table and disappeared as he put the ring on. Aragorn, whose name was given as Strider, seemed to show no surprise, only annoyance at Frodo’s foolish vanishing act.<ref name=Sign/> He arranged for an interview that night, where he warned them of the Black Riders and [[Bill Ferny]], then bluntly requested that they use him as a guide. After some consideration, and a note given to them by the forgetful [[Barliman Butterbur]] from Gandalf condoning him, Frodo agreed.<ref name=Strider/>
[[File:Jef Murray - Amon Sûl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jef Murray]] - ''Amon Sûl'']]
Aragorn’s plan to reach Rivendell was to first head toward [[Archet]] and bear right to [[Weathertop]].<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref> After the ambush at Weathertop and the wounding of Frodo, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] took over the position as leader of the Hobbits. After a while they met [[Glorfindel]], a friend of Aragorn’s,<ref name=Flight>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> and it was not much later that they arrived in Rivendell.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Reforging of the Sword.jpg|thumb|[[Darrell Sweet]] - ''The Reforging of the Sword'']]
After the Council of Elrond, Aragorn became a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. As a preparation for his travel, the ancient shards of [[Narsil]], the heirloom of his House, were reforged after 3 millennia. Aragorn carried the Sword Reforged, and renamed it [[Andúril]].<ref name=South>{{FR|South}}</ref>

Aragorn's intentions were to travel with the [[Fellowship of the Ring|company]] for a while before returning to [[Gondor]] with [[Boromir]].<ref name=Farewell>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> Aragorn encouraged the taking of the [[Caradhras|Redhorn Pass]], which ended in disaster. He conceded to Gandalf’s choice to pass through [[Moria]], but warned Gandalf to be cautious if he entered Moria, because he had a very evil memory from his previous visit to Moria.<ref name=South/> Indeed, after Gandalf fell into the abyss with [[Durin's Bane]], Aragorn was naturally elected leader of the company, despite some resentment by Boromir.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>

====Leading the Fellowship of the Ring====
Aragorn again amazed the rest of the Fellowship by his apparent closeness to the people of [[Lothlórien]], and his friendship with [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. At their departure, Galadriel offered him the [[Elfstone]] as a wedding gift from the family of the Elven bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref> It was worn by Aragorn ever after,{{fact}}<!--I've seen this claim made in various places and while it's probably true I can't find a source explicitly stating this (at least in LotR or the Silmarillion--> and from that he later took the name '''Elessar'''.<ref name=Farewell/><ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p. 871</ref>

Even at the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]] he was undecided, leaving it to Frodo for the final decision. For though it was obvious he wished to go to [[Minas Tirith]] with Boromir, he yet felt that it was his duty to go where the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] chose.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref>

[[File:Inger Edelfeldt - Death of Boromir.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Death of Boromir'' by [[Inger Edelfeldt]]]]
After Frodo escaped him and Boromir perished, he with the remaining members of the Fellowship, namely [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], chose to try and save [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] from the [[Uruk-hai]] that had ambushed them, forming the group that would later be known as the [[Three Hunters]].<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref>

He met [[Éomer]] in the fields of [[Rohan]], and an instant friendship formed, both feeling the honesty and lordliness of the other. Éomer took a risk for his sake, giving him horses, with the promise that one day Aragorn would return to [[Edoras]].<ref name=riders/> Aragorn, tracking the Hobbits, followed into [[Fangorn Forest]], where he met the resurrected [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref> After the restoration of [[Théoden]],<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref> he rode to [[Helm's Deep]] to fight in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. There he, alongside his new-found “brother” Éomer, and King Théoden, marshalled the defence against [[Saruman]]’s army. His revealed majesty upon the battlements of the Hornburg as he waited for the dawn caused some of the [[Dunlendings|Wild men]] to pause and shudder, and he heralded the return of Gandalf with [[Erkenbrand]].<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>

After Pippin’s terrifying experience with the [[Orthanc-stone]], Gandalf presented it in a formal manner to Aragorn, its rightful master, who hinted that it would be used by him eventually.<ref>{{TT|Palantir}}, pp. 594-5</ref> After the departure of Gandalf and Pippin to Minas Tirith, he rode for a while longer with Théoden, meeting up with his friend [[Halbarad]] of the North, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], and a company of staunch and fearless Rangers. Elladan and Elrohir gave him a message from Elrond: ""''The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the [[Paths of the Dead]]''"". Halbarad bore a gift from the Lady Arwen – the [[Livery of the heirs of Elendil|standard of Elendil]]. Aragorn knew the path set before him.<ref name=Company/>

====The Return of the King====
A little while later, Aragorn took his companions and his rangers and set out for [[Dunharrow]], departing from the King’s company. His course was clear: to take the Paths of the Dead, to summon the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]]. In Dunharrow, he met the lady [[Éowyn]], who had fallen in love with him. After making it clear that he could not accept her love, he turned towards the evil road with the dawn.<ref name=Company/>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Thus Came Aragorn.jpg|thumb|right|''Thus Came Aragorn'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The [[Grey Company]] passed through the [[Dark Door]] and the [[Dwimorberg]], the Dead following, and coming at last to the [[Stone of Erech]],<ref name=Company/> Aragorn summoned them to his aid. They drew their swords and blew their horns in answer, and swept down upon the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] at [[Pelargir]] and drove the mariners away. Aragorn released them, and took their ships north to Minas Tirith, where the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] raged. The Standard of Elendil broke forth, and his Dúnedain swept down, giving the final blow to the army of [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. The counter-attacked army of [[Sauron]] crumbled utterly, but Aragorn did not enter the city.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref><ref name=Debate/>

Aragorn, furling his banner, appointed [[Imrahil]] the temporary lord of the City, as the law demanded. Eventually, however, Aragorn did come to the [[Houses of Healing]], where he tended and restored Merry, Éowyn, and [[Faramir]], in accordance with the prophecy “''The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known''”. Many of the people of Minas Tirith came to Aragorn and followed him, asking that he heal those they knew. Aragorn worked late into the night, before finally leaving the city, hooded and cloaked. When in the morning the people saw the banner of [[Dol Amroth]], they wondered if the Return of the King had been but a dream.<ref name=""Houses"">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

[[File:Inger Edelfeldt - The Crowning of Aragorn.jpg|thumb|left|''The Crowning of Aragorn'' by [[Inger Edelfeldt]]]]
Aragorn held [[Last Debate|council]] with his trusted companions, namely Gandalf, Éomer, Imrahil, and Elrond’s sons – Halbarad had fallen in battle. He agreed to draw forth the forces of [[Mordor]] for the benefit of the [[Quest of the Ring]], and so arranged matters for the [[Battle of the Morannon]].<ref name=Debate/> After the destruction of the Ring in [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] and victory at the [[Black Gate|Morannon]], Aragorn returned at last in the triumphant manner that befitted his position. He was crowned at the gates of Minas Tirith, winning the hearts of the people of [[Gondor]].<ref name=""RK|Steward"">{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

===Reign as Elessar===
Aragorn ruled the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of Gondor and Arnor until year {{FoA|120|120}} of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref name=North/>

He pardoned the [[Easterlings]] that had surrendered and made peace with the [[Haradrim]]. He freed the slaves of Mordor and gave them the [[Sea of Núrnen]].<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 968</ref>

Some days after his coronation, Gandalf took Elessar up the slopes of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and there he found the scion of [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]], the symbol of his mastery of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Elrond and Arwen came to Gondor and Elrond gave Elessar the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] signifying the Kingship of Arnor. He wedded Arwen on Midsummer's day of 3019,<ref name=appstewards/> and then was forced to bid his old friends farewell. He turned back to his new kingdom as the Fourth Age dawned and the Ringbearers left the shores of Middle-earth forever.<ref name=Partings/>

One of his first tasks in the re-ordering of his realm was the restoration of [[Orthanc]] and ordered the [[Orthanc-stone]] to be returned there. With this opportunity, many secrets and hoarded treasures were revealed including the [[Star of Elendil|Elendilmir]] which Saruman took from Isildur's body. Elessar received the Elendilmir with reverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of [[Arnor]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Elessar gave his [[Steward of Gondor|Steward]] Faramir the title [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]] and created him as [[Prince of Ithilien]].<ref name=""RK|Steward"">{{RK|Steward}}</ref> He declared the [[Drúadan Forest]] to belong to the [[Drúedain]] and a protected enclave of his Kingdom.<ref name=Partings>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> He also re-established the Great [[Council of Gondor]] whose chief councillor was the Steward.<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> He also renewed the [[Oath of Eorl]] with Éomer.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

As for [[the Shire]], he declared it a Free Land under the protection of the Northern Sceptre and forbade Men from entering it. He appointed the [[Thain]], the [[Master of Buckland]], and the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] Counsellors of the North-kingdom. Also he offered to the Shire the [[Westmarch|lands]] up to the [[Tower Hills|Emyn Beraid]].<ref name=""later"">{{App|Later}}</ref>

He founded the royal [[House of Telcontar]], he had a son, [[Eldarion]], and a number of daughters.<ref name=Tale/>
[[File:Mithril Miniatures - The Passing of Elessar.jpg|thumb|200px|right|""The Passing of Elessar"" - ''[[Mithril Miniatures|Mithril Miniature]]'']]
King Elessar died after 210 years of life and 122 years of rule and was succeeded by his son Eldarion. His wife Arwen, now mortal, gave up her life shortly afterwards in the year 121, aged 2,901.<ref name=Tale/>

==Characteristics==

Tolkien|Tolkien]] later wrote that he was at least 6'6"".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 229 (citing a ""late, unpublished note"").</ref>

===Personality===
Aragorn held his heritage in high esteem and was willing to commit to a single path in life in the name of love.<ref name=""Tale"" /> He possessed a nigh indomitable will, as he psychically challenged [[Sauron]] for control of the ''[[Palantíri| palantír]]'' of [[Orthanc]] and proved to be victorious.<ref name=""Company"">{{RK|Company}}</ref> Yet this will did not prevent him from honoring his own word and the words of his forebears.<ref name=""Debate"">{{RK|Debate}}</ref> Aragorn was also described as '[[Elves|Elven]]-wise' due to spending his youth in Rivendell with [[Elrond]] as well as learning from [[Gandalf]].<ref name=""Tale"" />

===Weapons and skills===
Aragorn wielded [[Andúril]], the sword re-forged from the shards of [[Narsil]] as his weapon of choice throughout the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|South}} ""Aragorn had Andúril but no other weapon.""</ref> He was an extremely capable swordsman, as he was able to survive the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] unscathed along with [[Éomer]] and [[Imrahil]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> He was also a capable military tactician, as during that same battle, he was able to reinforce the [[Rohirrim]] and hit the weakest point of the army of [[Mordor]], along with taking time to rearrange his army's positions during the [[Battle of the Morannon]].<ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref> He was also a skilled healer, most notably with the herb [[Athelas]], as he was able to heal [[Faramir]] and [[Éowyn]] of their wounds,<ref name=""Houses"" /> as well as slow down the effects of the [[Morgul-knife]] used to stab [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]].<ref name=Flight/>

===Relation to Arwen===
Arwen was a very distant cousin of Aragorn. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the [[Half-elven]] were joined.<ref name=""Numenor"">{{App|A1i}}</ref> Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves ([[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and brothers [[Thingol|Elwë]], [[Olwë]], and [[Elmo]]) as well as the only line with [[Maiar]]in blood through Arwen's great-great-grandmother, [[Melian]]. There were at least two marriages between descendants of Elendil in Aragorn's ancestry, so Aragorn was related to Arwen by blood along at least three lines.

Through his father, Arathorn II, Aragorn was Arwen's first cousin sixty-two times removed through his ancestor Arvedui and sixty-seven times removed through his ancestor Fíriel. Both of these lines descend through four generations of the Kings of Númenor,<ref name=""Numenor"" /> Silmariën, eighteen generations of the Lords of Andúnië,<ref>{{UT|Kings}}</ref> and Elendil, as well as Aranarth and fifteen succeeding generations of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain,<ref name=""North"">{{App|North}}</ref> including Aragorn himself. Aragorn's mother Gilraen was also descended from Aranarth,<ref name=""North"" /> but the number of generations between them is unknown.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest unpublished versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''), the character that later became Aragorn was called '''''[[Trotter]]''''' instead of Strider, and was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] instead of a [[Men|Man]]. He had wooden feet, because he had once travelled to Mordor and been tortured there with the character envisioned as a relative of Bilbo and Frodo. This name would carry over when the character was revised into a man and would remain in use for much of the book's composition. During the writing of the latter portions of Book II, Tolkien would temporarily rename the character, ''[[Elfstone]]'' on the proposition that a man should not have an Elvish name. Another name considered was ''[[Ingold]].''<ref name=""comp"">{{HM|RC}}, p. XXII and p. XXIV</ref>

In the first edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Aragorn's year of death was S.R. 1521. The month and day of his death and the year in the reckoning of Gondor were not stated.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 722</ref>

'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)]]'':'''
:Aragorn was voiced by [[Theodore Bikel]] in the 1980 [[Rankin/Bass]] animated film. His role is dramatically reduced to a handful of scenes and there is no mention of any previous involvement with the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Aragorn is played by [[Viggo Mortensen]], though [[Stuart Townsend]] was originally cast in the role. Townsend was deemed too young and parted ways with the production over creative differences. Mortensen had just two weeks to train for his first scene, the standoff with the [[Nazgûl]] at [[Weathertop]]. In a notable departure from the source material, Aragorn, due to his lineage including those who fell to the temptation of evil (namely [[Isildur]]), is riddled with anxiety and self-doubt regarding his place as king of Gondor. He is also portrayed as wary of Men's strength and potential, likely owing to being raised among Elves. Nonetheless, he promises a dying [[Boromir]] that he will not let [[Minas Tirith]] fall. He also claims Boromir's bracers (which have emblems of the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]]), which symbolise a gradual acceptance of his heritage.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Aragorn's part in this film is largely similar to the events in the book. The most significant difference is that, in the book, there was no [[Wargs|Warg]] attack on the party travelling to Helm's Deep and Aragorn did not fall down a cliff.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Aragorn finally steps into his role as king after having a lot of self-doubt beforehand.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Although he is not physically present, he is mentioned by [[Thranduil]] to his son, [[Legolas]]. Thranduil tells Legolas to seek a young ranger known as ""Strider"" and that Legolas would have to discover Strider's true name for himself. In the continuity of the films, Aragorn would have been 27 rather than a ten-year-old child.

===Television===
'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''
:Aragorn is portrayed by [[Kari Väänänen]], the same actor who played [[Gollum]] in the series.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Aragorn was voiced by [[Robert Stephens]].  For his early scenes, according to [[John McAndrew]] (Pippin), Stephens adopted an accurate Bristol accent to help suggest the disguise Strider adopted in Bree.

'''2001-2003: ''[[Pán prsteňov]]'':'''
:The voice of Aragorn is provided by Boris Farkaš.

'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Aragorn is a playable character. His storyline is dubbed ""Path of a King"". He journeys through Paths of the Dead with Legolas and Gimli, later they fight on Pelennor fields and at the Black Gate. Chris Edgerly takes over for Mortensen as Aragorn's voice actor.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:In the Prologue, Aragorn saves Men/Hobbit characters from brigands, but is forced to leave soon, as he has to intercept Frodo in Bree. Later arriving at the Prancing Pony, the characters meet him again and help him look in the surrounding area for Hobbits, who did not arrive in time. When the player returns, Aragorn and the Hobbits have already departed, and their next meeting is in Rivendell, where Aragorn entrusts the player with defence of the North while the Fellowship is gone.

:He is a friend of two of the game's main characters, [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]] and [[Andriel]].

Aragorn was impressed by his skills and bravery, and taught him much about tracking. Eradan was a companion of Aragorn on many of his journeys. Aragorn trusted Eradan much, though he never told him what the reason was behind the protection of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/backstory#dunedainAnchor|articlename=Human Character: Eradan's History|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=24 December 2011}}</ref>

:Eradan, Andriel and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] meet Aragorn in the Prancing Pony to warn him, on Halbarad's request, after the Nazgûl attacked and defeated the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] at [[Sarn Ford]], and entered the Shire. They also tell him about a conversation between the Witch-king and [[Agandaûr]], which the three heroes overheard shortly after the attack. Agandaûr summoned the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and assembled an army in [[Fornost]], which planned to aid the Nazgûl in their search for [[the One Ring]]. Aragorn sends Eradan, Andriel and Farin to Fornost, to stop Agandaûr and his army.<ref name=""Prologue"" /> While Eradan, Andriel, Farin, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] stopped Agandaûr's army,<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Chapter 1: Fornost''</ref> Aragorn met with [[Frodo Baggins]] and left Bree.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Chapter 2: The Barrow Downs'', Bree</ref>

'''Peeping Jack''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name=""Perry"">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Peeping Jack espied [[Perry-the-Winkle (hobbit)|Perry-the-Winkle]] riding to [[Faraway]] on the [[Lonely Troll]]'s back. Later, upon Perry's return, Peeping Jack revealed his spying to the rest of the People.<ref name=""Perry"" />

Peeping Jack was one of the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to Faraway in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll. Peeping Jack was among four Hobbits who the Troll never wanted to see again.<ref name=""Perry"" />

The name ""Peeping Jack"" alludes to the character's role as a spy and is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Peeping Tom|Peeping Tom]].<ref name=""IE"">{{HM|IE}}, ""Giving of Names""</ref>

== Background ==
In the first version of the poem in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was entitled ''The Bumpus'', Peeping Jack didn’t exist and William Winkle himself told the People where he had been.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> Peeping Jack was also absent in the second version on [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> in which Tolkien revised the poem as part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of his ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series.

{{Quote|Oromë is a mighty lord. If he is less strong than [[Tulkas]], he is more dreadful in anger.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar""}}

'''Oromë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] and one of the [[Aratar]],<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>  also known as the '''Huntsman of the Valar'''<ref>{{App|South}}, note 1 of p. 1039</ref> and the '''Great Rider'''.<ref name=Captivity>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> He is considered one of the more powerful of the Valar.<ref name=vala/>

==Attributes==
Oromë was a hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding on his steed [[Nahar]], and blowing his great horn [[Valaróma]]. He loved [[horses]] and [[hounds]] as well as all trees and forests. In [[Yavanna]]'s woods in [[Valinor]], he trained his folk and beasts to hunt the evil creatures of Melkor.<ref name=vala/> He hunted all foul beasts of Morgoth, and when he blew his horn, all would know that the woods had been purged.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Oromë was known for his terrible wrath, in contrast to [[Tulkas]], who laughed often.<ref name=vala/>

Oromë was the brother of [[Nessa]] and the husband of [[Vána]].<ref name=vala/>

==History==
[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|left|''Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth'' by Kip Rasmussen]]
During the [[Years of the Trees]], after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in [[Aman]], Oromë was the last who came to Valinor, and even then he still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion.<ref name=vala/> He visited [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], hunting monsters and fell creatures and the shadows fled temporarily until he left.<ref name=s1>{{S|Days}}</ref>

Being a powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against [[Morgoth]], who feared Oromë in his anger. In efforts against Oromë, Melkor raised the [[Misty Mountains]] as an impediment to his riding,<ref name=Captivity/> and sowed fear among the [[Elves]] of a [[Hunter and Rider|dark Rider]] who, upon his wild horse, would devour Elves who wondered to far.

Oromë was the first among the Valar to find the Elves at [[Cuiviénen]]. When at length some dared to approach him, and asked his name, he answered: ""Oromë"". When they asked what it meant, he again answered: ""Oromë. To me only is it given; for I am Oromë""; while Oromë had many glorious titles, he withheld them so that the Elves would not be afraid. When the Elves further asked the name of his horse, and if it bore any meaning, Oromë answered: ""Nahar, and he is called from the sound of his voice, when he is eager to run”.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

It was Oromë who gave the Elves the name ""[[Eldar]]"". Seeking to ensure their safety, Oromë accompanied the Elves from Cuiviénen to [[Beleriand]]. 

After the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, Oromë led his host in pursuit of Morgoth and [[Ungoliant]]. However, they were thwarted by Ungoliant's unlight.<ref name=Darkening>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

Because Oromë was the only Vala who travelled in Middle-earth during the [[Elder Days]], it was believed, even during the [[Third Age]] that the wild [[cows|oxen]] found near the [[Sea of Rhun]] descended from his [[Kine of Araw|Kine]].<ref>{{App|South}}, Stewards of Gondor, footnote after Vorondil the Hunter, p. 1039</ref>

==Legacy==
In the aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Fingolfin]] rode to Angband alone to challenge Morgoth to single combat. Those who saw him thought Oromë himself had arrived; for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar.<ref name=Ruin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] in the [[Third Age]], King [[Théoden]] displayed a drive and ferocity comparable to that of Oromë.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 838</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Oromë'' is said to be derived from his [[Valarin]] name '''''Arōmēz'''''.<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 400</ref> 

His name is translated as ""Horn-blowing"" and ""Sound of Horns"".<ref>{{PE|21}}, pp. 82, 85</ref>

===Other names===
'''''Araw''''' was the [[Sindarin]] form of the name of the Oromë,<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 96</ref><ref>{{VT|39a}}, p. 10</ref> while its [[North Sindarin]] form was '''''Arum'''''.<ref name=Quendi /> 

'''''Tauron''''' was an epithet used by the [[Sindar]] for Oromë.<ref name=Index>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=PM/> In the ''[[Valaquenta]]'', ''Tauron'' is translated as ""Lord of Forests"".<ref name=Index/> Another translation is ""The Forester"".<ref name=""Index""/><ref name=PM>{{PM|XI}}, p. 358 (note 21)</ref> The language, to which the name pertains, remains non-explicit in [[Tolkien]]'s texts:
#[[Quenya]] word? The root of the word could be ''[[taure]]'' (""great wood"") plus the ending ''[[-on]]''. The name would thus have the sense ""One of forests"".<ref>Suggestion by [[User:Sage]]</ref>
#[[Sindarin]] word? This would be suggested by its usage among the Sindar and by the [[Noldorin]] form it replaced (see below).

'''''Béma''''' was the name used by the [[Northmen]] for Oromë. As the great huntsman and horseman of the Valar, he and his steed Nahar were known to the horse-loving people of [[Rohan]], who claimed that their great horses, the [[Mearas]], had ancestors brought out of [[Aman|the West]] by Béma himself.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 
The name ''Béma'' is also from the [[Rohanese|tongue of Rohan]] ([[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was inspired by the [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:beme|béme]]'' ""trumpet"").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 153</ref>

Tolkien used at least two earlier forms of the by-name ''Tauron'':
#''Tavros'' - the form ''Tauros'' replaced - used in such early texts as the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]''.<ref>{{HM|LB}}, ''passim''</ref> The name is [[Noldorin|Gnomish]], defined as ""Chief wood fay 'the Blue Spirit of the Woods'"".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 69</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 267</ref><ref group=""note"">The form ''Tavros'' cited here from the ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 11|Gnomish Lexicon]]'', is defined as a ""proper name"". The form ''tavros'' (with a minuscule ''t'') is defined as ""forest, wooded land"".</ref>
#''Tauros'' - the form ''Tauron'' replaced - is a [[Noldorin]] word defined in the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' as meaning ""Forest-Dread"" ([[Sundocarme|roots]] [[TAW|TÁWAR]] + [[GOS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 391</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Oromë is referred to as ''Wáðfréa'' ""Huntinglord"", ''Huntena  fréa'' ""Hunting  Lord and Lord of  Hunters"" and ''Wealdafréa'' ""Lord of Forests"". The name ''Béaming'' is a translation of Q. ''Aldaron''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

{{familytree/end}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest form of the legendarium Oromë was described as the son of [[Aulë]] and [[Yavanna]] whilst having the daughter [[Nielíqui]] with [[Vána]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, p. 288</ref> ([[Nessa]] was already his sister; see [[Valarindi]], Children of the Valar)

'''Turgon''' was an [[Elves|Elven]] king of the [[Noldor]], second son of [[Fingolfin]], brother to [[Fingon]], [[Aredhel]] and [[Argon]]. He was lord of the [[Gondolindrim|Elves of Nevrast]], and later of the Hidden City of [[Gondolin]].

He was often called ""''the Wise''"" and is described as ""tallest of all the [[Children of the World]], save [[Thingol]]""; with a white and gold [[Glamdring|sword]] in an ivory sheath.<ref name=""Tuor"">{{UT|Tuor}}, ""Notes"", p. 56, note 31</ref> He sat in a high throne, holding his staff of doom.<ref name=""Maeglin"">{{S|16}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Marya Filatova - Turukano and Elenwe.jpg|left|150px|thumb|''Turukáno and Elenwe'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
===Life in Aman===
Turgon was born in the [[Year of the Trees 1300]], the same year as his cousin [[Finrod]].<ref>{{AA|85|note}}, p. 106</ref> At some point, he married [[Elenwë]] of the [[Vanyar]], and they had a child: [[Idril]]. 

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], [[Fëanor]] gave his famous speech in [[Tirion]] and proclaimed his [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]. Turgon and his father [[Fingolfin]] spoke against Fëanor, and the Fëanorians almost unsheathed their swords, but [[Finarfin]] intervened and invited the Noldor to ponder the matter. Turgon and his friend Finrod were together against the departure of the Noldor from [[Aman]], but the Noldorin assembly chose [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]]. So Turgon set out on the journey, and although he was originally against it, he did not come back after the [[Doom of Mandos]] because ""Fingon and Turgon were bold and fiery of heart, and loath to abandon any task to which they had put their hands until the bitter end, if bitter it must be"". After Fëanor and his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]] departed using the only ships, abandoning the remaining Noldor, Turgon went with his people across the dangerous [[Helcaraxë]] alongside his father Fingolfin.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref> During the crossing, Turgon's wife Elenwë, and their daughter Idril fell into the bitter waters. Turgon risked his life to save them, but he only could save Idril, and Elenwë was lost. Turgon was always hostile to the [[House of Fëanor]] thereafter.<ref>{{PM|XI4}}, pp. 345-346</ref>

===Building of Gondolin===
Once they arrived in [[Middle-earth]], Turgon and his followers settled at [[Vinyamar]] in [[Nevrast]]. In {{FA|50}}, he and Finrod journeyed together along [[Sirion]], and while they slept near the [[Aelin-uial]], [[Ulmo]] sent both of them a dream to look for a hidden place where they could be safe from the power of [[Morgoth]]. Then, in the following year, Ulmo appeared directly to Turgon and guided him to the vale of [[Tumladen]] in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Initially, Turgon left Tumladen and returned to Vinyamar, keeping his discovery a secret for many years and planning the construction of a city.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref> 
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Turgon and Idril.jpg|thumb|''Turgon and Idril'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
After the [[Dagor Aglareb]], Turgon began to once again feel the restlessness set in his heart by Ulmo, and his thought turned to Tumladen. He secretly moved many of the most skilled Noldor to the valley, and had them build [[Gondolin]]. When it was completed in {{FA|116}},<ref>{{GA|111}}</ref> he abandoned Vinyamar with all his people and led them to Tumladen in secret, hidden by the power of Ulmo. Before leaving, however, he left in Vinyamar a sword, mail and helm for one who would come in the hour of direst need of the Noldor and deliver hope, following Ulmo's prophecy. In his Hidden City, Turgon was King of the [[Gondolindrim]], and all kept working on embellishing Gondolin. He even personally created the two trees [[Glingal and Belthil]] in the image of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>

In {{FA|400}},<ref>{{GA|120}}</ref> after the unfortunate events concerning his sister [[Aredhel]], Turgon welcomed his nephew [[Maeglin]], who became a close counsellor.<ref name=""Maeglin"" />

===Doom of the Noldor===
In {{FA|458}} Turgon took in [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]], who were saved by the [[Eagles]]. They forged a strong friendship, but after a year he allowed them to leave the city, although it was against his law.<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> Turgon and the two brothers met again in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]: in the middle of the battle, they rejoiced in their meeting. When Fingon was killed and the battle seemed lost, Huor urged Turgon to leave, prophesying that from both of them a new [[Eärendil|star]] would rise. Thanks to the men of the [[House of Hador]] in the [[Fen of Serech]], the Gondolindrim escaped, but Huor was killed and Húrin captured. Although the battle was still lost, Turgon's unexpected intervention prevented the rout from completely destroying the armies of the Noldor and their allies.<ref name=""Nirnaeth"">{{S|20}}</ref>

With the death of his brother Fingon, Turgon became the new [[High King of the Noldor]], and he was the most feared of the enemies of [[Morgoth]], as he remained hidden.<ref>{{UT|1}}, p. 18</ref> In those times, [[Círdan]] settled in the [[Mouths of Sirion]], and with his help, Turgon sent seven boats to the [[Aman|West]] to ask help to the Valar, but all of them were wrecked.<ref name=""Nirnaeth"" />
[[File:Catherine Karina Chmiel - Turgon, Idril, and Maeglin together.jpg|thumb|''Turgon, Idril, and Maeglin together'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]
In {{FA|495}},<ref>{{GA|299}}</ref> [[Voronwë]], the only survivor of the shipwrecks, brought into the Hidden City a man: [[Tuor]], son of Huor. The King received him in the [[Tower of the King]], and when Tuor spoke, his cloak fell, revealing the arms Turgon had left in Vinyamar following Ulmo's orders nearly 400 years earlier.<ref name=""Tuor"" /> Tuor gave him [[Ulmo's warning]]: the [[Doom of the Noldor]] was approaching, so the [[Gondolindrim]] had to leave their fair city and go down Sirion to the sea. But the King had become proud and loved his kingdom, so he rejected the counsel of the Vala. However, he ordered the blocking up of the [[Seven Gates]], so that no one could enter the city, and the only news that came in was that brought by [[Thorondor]].<ref name=""Fall"">{{S|23}}</ref>

Some years later, Húrin was released by Morgoth, and he approached the [[Echoriad]] with the hope of returning to Gondolin. Thorondor informed Turgon, but he distrusted Húrin and did not help him. Turgon later regretted it, but it was too late; through Húrin's wanderings, the location of the Hidden City became known to Morgoth.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 271-272</ref>

Seven years after his coming, Tuor married Idril. Turgon blessed their union, as he held Tuor in great esteem and he had not forgotten the words of Huor in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.<ref name=""Fall"">{{S|23}}</ref>

Morgoth attacked the city in {{FA|510}}.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> The tale of this battle was told in [[Turgon#Other versions of the legendarium|''The Fall of Gondolin'']], including Turgon's defence of the Tower of the King together with the people of his stronghold: ""and mighty was its fall and the fall of Turgon in its ruin"".<ref name=""Fall"">{{S|23}}</ref>

A group of [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]] survived the [[Fall of Gondolin]] and reached the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. There [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]] was named the next High King of the Noldor. Turgon's grandson, [[Eärendil|Eärendil the Blessed]], would later bring salvation to Middle-earth, thus fulfilling Morgoth's fears about him.

==Etymology==
''Turgon'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning ""Ruling Lord"" or ""Victory Prince"",<ref name=""Eldarin"">{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 112-113</ref> probably a combination of ''[[tur]]'' (""master"")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''tur''</ref> and ''-gon'' (""lord, prince"").<ref name=""Feanor"">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 345</ref>

However, in ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', Tolkien translated ''Turgon'' as ""Master Shout"". There it is explained that the name is the [[Sindarized]] version of his [[Quenya]] [[father-name]], '''''Turukáno''''',<ref name=""Feanor"" /> clearly meaning ""Victory Commander"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-136007163.html|articlename=Q. ''Turucáno'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=2 June 2020}}</ref>

A rejected Quenya name was ''Turondo'' (""Lord of Stone"").<ref name=""Eldarin"" /> In the earliest stage of the Elvish [[languages]], the [[Qenya]] name was the same, and the [[Gnomish]] name was also ''Turgon'', which [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggests to be derived from the [[root]] [[TUR|TURU]] (""be strong"").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ""Tuor""</ref>

At one point ''Sarafinwë'' was considered for his father name, with the name ''Turgond (Turukond)'' as a title.<ref name=""Eldarin"" /> While ""Sarafinwë"" was not defined, it is notable that the root [[SAR]] had the meaning of ""stone"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3855390275.html|articlename=Q.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''===
{{quote|But I Turgon will not leave my city, and will burn with it.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]""}}

Turgon already appears in the earliest stage of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. He is the son of Finwë Nólemë, lord of the [[Noldoli]] (precursor of both [[Finwë]] and [[Fingolfin]]). Before Turgon (or ''Turondo'' in [[Qenya]]) was born, [[Amnon]] prophesied the fall of Gondolin and the fade of Turgon.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 167, 172</ref> Turgon was born soon after the [[Exile of the Noldor|Flight of the Noldoli]] in [[Lake Mithrim]] or near [[Sirion]]. Later he participated in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], and there his father was isolated and slain by the enemy, and the Orcs cut out Nólemë's heart. But Turgon rescued the body, and the [[scarlet heart]] became his emblem. With terrible wrath, he ran out of the battle, and went to save the women and children of the camps. Then he fled south along Sirion, and aided by its magic waters, he escaped into a secret place away from [[Melko]]. There the Noldoli built the secret city of Gondolin and Turgon became their king.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 238-242</ref>

Many years later, when [[Tuor#Other versions of the legendarium|Tuor]] came to the city, he found Turgon in the [[Square of the Palace]]. ""Then Turgon king of Gondolin robed in white with a belt of gold, and a coronet of garnets upon his head, stood before his doors and spake from the head of the white stairs that led thereto."" Tuor was well received, as his coming was prophesied, but [[Ulmo's warning]] was not attended by the king, who answered that he had already sent boats to the West which had never come back. However, Turgon knew that Tuor had the favour of the Valar, and invited him to dwell in Gondolin, even in the royal halls.<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160–2}}

Many years later, Turgon allowed the wedding of Tuor and his daughter Idril. All the [[Gondothlim]] and the king were overjoyed when [[Eärendel]] was born, except [[Meglin]], the king's nephew and close counsellor.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|164–5}} One year later, news came about spies of [[Morgoth|Melko]] near [[Tumladin]], and the king remembered the words of Tuor, so he tripled the watch and ordered preparations for war.<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|167}} However, more years passed and his fear softened, and the watch was reduced again, as the Gondothlim became confident after Melko withdrew the spies.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|170}}
[[File:Natalie Chen - Turgon King of Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Turgon King of Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Natalie Chen|Natalie Chen]]]]
During the [[Tarnin Austa]], news came about the armies of Melko approaching the city, so Turgon called a council and all the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]] came to his palace. Among them were his personal guard, the [[House of the King]], who wore his emblems: the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the [[scarlet heart]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|172}} In the council, all the lords of Gondolin supported Tuor, who wanted to leave the city to save all the people; but the king was convinced by Meglin and [[Salgant]] alone, because they appealed to the wealth and strength of the city.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|175–6}}

Thus, the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began. Turgon watched most of the battle from [[Tower of the King|his tower]],<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|180}} while his folk was held in reserve in the Square of the Palace, waiting in order to defend him.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|183}} Throughout the siege, the king sent the different reserved hosts to help where necessary, until the remnants of all the surviving houses finally gathered in the Square. After [[Ecthelion of the Fountain]] there killed [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], the king came down in splendour and helped his house to cleanse the square. But the steam of the fountains killed some men, so the king was saved and taken under [[Glingol]] and [[Bansil]]. Then said the king: ""''Great is the fall of Gondolin!''"", the words of the prophet [[Amnon]]. Seeing he had brought ruin upon his city, he proclaimed he would not fight against [[Doom of the Noldor|Doom]], so he ordered the survivors to follow Tuor and threw down his [[Crown of the Hidden Kingdom|
crown]] at the roots of Glingol. [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] picked it up, but Turgon rejected it and climbed to the pinnacle of his tower.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|184–5}}

{{blockquote|There he shouted in a voice like a horn blown among the mountains, and all that were gathered beneath the Trees and the foemen in the mists of the square heard him: ""Great is the victory of the Noldoli!"" And 'tis said that it was then middle night, and that the Orcs yelled in derision.}}

Now, Tuor wanted to escape from the city to save the women and children, but he could not leave the king, so messengers were sent to convince Turgon to flee. But Turgon refused thrice, saying he would not leave his city and would burn with it. His royal house remained at his side, protecting the tower.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|185}} Later, Tuor and Idril could see from the [[Gar Ainion]] how the Square of the King was taken by enemies. Dragons crushed the base of the tower and this fell, covered in flames. ""Great was the clangour of that terrible fall, and therein passed Turgon King of the Gondothlim"". Idril wept for her father, saying ""''Sad is the blindness of the wise''""; and Tuor answered ""''Sad too is the stubbornness of those we love — yet 'twas a valiant fault''"".<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|187}}

{{Quote|Finrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in noble and generous heart, though he had the high courage of the Ñoldor and in his youth their eagerness and unrest; and he had also from his Telerin mother a love of the sea and dreams of far lands that he had never seen.|''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', ""[[Shibboleth of Fëanor]]""}}

'''Finrod''' was an [[Elves|Elven]] king of the [[Noldor]], eldest son of [[Finarfin]] and older brother to [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]] and [[Galadriel]]. Finrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in his noble and generous heart. 

In [[Beleriand]], Finrod became the ruler of [[Nargothrond]], taking the [[Epessë|after-name]] of '''Felagund'''. He was a wise, just and powerful Elf, and a great traveller.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 144</ref>

==History==
Finrod was born in [[Eldamar]] in the [[Year of the Trees 1300]] within the [[First Age]], the same as his cousin [[Turgon]].<ref>{{AA|85|note}}</ref> They were friends, and his beloved was [[Amarië]] of the [[Vanyar]].

Finrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in noble and generous heart, though he had the high courage of the Noldor and in his youth their eagerness and unrest; and he had also from his Telerin mother a love of the sea and dreams of far lands that he had never seen.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

Finrod was among those who opposed [[Fëanor]] and the [[Exile of the Noldor]]. However, when the Noldor were set to depart from [[Aman]], he joined them, for he would not be sundered from his friends and his people who were eager to go. Also, he had no wish to abandon his people to Fëanor's rule.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

===Return of the Noldor===
Finrod, along with his father, led the rear of the host along with many of the noblest and wisest of the Noldor; and often they looked behind them to see their fair city, especially Finrod, for he had to leave Amarië behind. With him, he brought along many treasures from [[Tirion]],<ref name=""return"">{{S|Return}}</ref> including [[Ring of Barahir|his Ring]].<ref name=""beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Finrod and his people did not participate in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. While they were travelling up the coast of [[Araman]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Mandos]] appeared and pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], and in that hour, Finarfin forsook the march and returned to [[Valinor]] with many of his people. However, Finrod and his siblings went forward still and led their people on the long and perilous march to [[Middle-earth]].

===Life in Beleriand===
After their victory in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], the Noldor started building their numerous realms. Finrod established the tower of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] on the island of [[Tol Sirion]]. Once, while journeying southward along the river [[Sirion]], Finrod and his friend [[Turgon]] encamped upon its banks. [[Ulmo]], coming up the river, laid a deep sleep upon them and heavy dreams; and it seemed to each that he was bidden to prepare for a day of evil, and to establish a retreat, lest [[Morgoth]] should burst from [[Angband]] and overthrow the armies of the North.

[[File:Mysilvergreen - Finrod Felagund.jpg|left|thumb|''Finrod Felagund'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
Now on a time Finrod and his sister [[Galadriel]] were guests of King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], their kinsman in [[Doriath]]. There, Finrod told Thingol of his admiration for the halls of [[Menegroth]]; and Thingol spoke to him of the deep gorge of the river [[Narog]] and told him about the caves under the [[High Faroth]] in its deep western shore. Thus Finrod came to the [[Caverns of Narog]] and established there deep halls and armouries; and that stronghold was called [[Nargothrond]]. In this he was aided by the [[Dwarves]] of the [[Blue Mountains]], and Finrod rewarded them with many jewels from Valinor. In that time, the [[Nauglamír]] was made for him, the Necklace of the Dwarves. After Nargothrond was made, Finrod committed Minas Tirith to the keeping of [[Orodreth]], his nephew, and was referred to by the additional name of ''Felagund'', an honorific title given him by the Dwarves, meaning a ""Maker of Caves"".

The realm of Nargothrond extended to the sea, excluding the [[Falas]]. Finrod was a friend and ally of [[Círdan]], and had also built the tower [[Barad Nimras]] upon the cape.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

===Encounter with Men===
[[File:Steamey - Finrod, Beor and the Green-elves of Ossiriand.jpg|thumb|''Finrod, Beor and the Green-elves of Ossiriand'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamy]]]]
When over three hundred years had passed since the Noldor came to Beleriand, Finrod journeyed east of Sirion and went hunting with [[Maglor]] and [[Maedhros]], two of the [[sons of Fëanor]]. But he wearied of the hunt and passed on alone towards the mountains of [[Ered Lindon]]. There, in the lands of [[Thargelion]], in [[East Beleriand]], Finrod was the first of the Noldor to come across [[Men]]. These were the kindred and followers of [[Bëor]] [[The Old]]. He went among them while they were sleeping and, picking up a harp which Bëor had laid aside, played music upon it such as the ears of men had not heard. When the men awoke and listened to his song, each thought that he was in some fair dream. He long stayed with them, learning [[Taliska|their language]] and teaching them [[Sindarin]]. He also intervened on behalf of the [[Laiquendi]] of [[Ossiriand]], who feared Men would destroy their home, and he got permission of [[Thingol]], who held rule over all [[Beleriand]], to guide the Men to [[Estolad]].<ref name=""West"">{{S|West}}</ref>

Finrod had a close friendship with [[Andreth]] of the [[House of Bëor]], whom he often visited during the [[Siege of Angband]] to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.

Finrod participated in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], fighting in the [[Fen of Serech]], when he was surrounded by [[Orcs]]. It was [[Barahir]] of the [[House of Bëor]] who saved his life, and Finrod swore an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and all his kin. As a token he gave Barahir his ring, which became known as the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

When, ten years later, Barahir's son [[Beren]] came to Nargothrond seeking help, Finrod went with him on the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] to repay his debt. [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using barely veiled threats related to their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]) most of Nargothrond to stay behind. Only ten warriors, headed by one [[Edrahil]], were faithful and came with them. Beneath the [[Shadowy Mountains]] they came upon a company of [[Orcs]], and slew them all in their camp. They took their gear and weapons, and by the magic of Finrod, their own forms and faces were changed to the likeness of Orcs. Thus disguised, they came far upon their northward road between [[Ered Wethrin]] and the highlands of [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]. However, the twelve were captured and imprisoned by [[Sauron]] on [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] (""Isle of Werewolves"").<ref name=""beren"" />

Thus befell the contest of Finrod and Sauron. Finrod strove with Sauron in [[He chanted a song of wizardry,|songs of power]], and the power of the Elven King was very great. But in the end, Sauron had the mastery.

Then Sauron stripped from them their disguise, but though their kinds were revealed, he could not discover their names or their purposes. 

Sauron imprisoned them and one by one they were killed by werewolves until only Beren and Felagund were left, but none of the companions betrayed them. When the werewolf came to kill Beren, Felagund put forth all his power and burst his bonds. He wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with his hands and teeth. Yet he himself was mortally wounded, and he died in the dark, in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus King Finrod Felagund, the fairest and most beloved of the house of [[Finwë]], redeemed his oath.

===Reincarnation===
[[File:Donato Giancola - Lore.jpeg|thumb|An Elf loremaster ponders at a mural of Finrod leading his House in battle. Art by [[Donato Giancola]]]]
Before the First Age ended after the [[War of Wrath]], the exiled Noldor were all under a ban imposed by [[Manwë]] and could not return in bodily form to the Blessed Realm.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel II, p. 380</ref> However, as a reward for his noble and selfless actions in life, as well as his reluctance to depart the [[Undying Lands]] for Middle-earth during the Flight of the Noldor hundreds of years earlier, Finrod was allowed to be released from the [[Halls of Mandos]] and to [[Elven life cycle#Death and reincarnation|re-embody]] in Valinor after only a short time. According to the [[Lay of Leithian]], Finrod still dwells beneath the trees in [[Eldamar]], reuniting with both his father Finarfin and his beloved Amarië.<ref name=""beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref><ref name=""GA-2"">{{GA|180}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{seealso|#Other versions of the legendarium}}
{{Pronounce|Finrod Felagund.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Finrod'' is the [[Sindarin]] form of his [[father-name]] '''''Findaráto''''' (""[Golden-]Haired Champion""). It is possible he and his brother [[Angrod]] were first called ''[[Aráto]]'', and later differentiated adding ''find-'', referred to the golden hair derived from [[Indis]]. This name was [[Telerin]] in form where the adjectival element (""aráto"" in this case) was typically placed second while in [[Quenya]] it would have preceded. Thus, the more natural Quenya form would have been '''''Artafindë'''''.<ref name=""Finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|346–347}}

===Felagund===
'''''Felagund''''' was an [[epessë]] given to him by the [[Dwarves]] that expanded the caves of Nargothrond, and meant ""Hewer of Caves"". It is not Sindarin, but rather [[Sindarinized]] [[Khuzdul]], from '''''Felakgundu'''''. The name was Eldarized by other as '''''Felagon''''' (in relation with Fin''gon'', Tur''gon'').<ref>{{PM|Felagund}}, p. 352</ref> 

While revising his [[Elvish]] languages in later years, [[Tolkien]] reinterpreted ''Felagund'' as ""den-dweller, brock, badger"", from [[Sindarin]] ''fela'', which was used for dens made by wild animals or temporary dwellings of wandering folks, unrelated to big carved caves. The west bank of Narog had many dens of badgers, some of them occupied by [[Petty-dwarves]]. It was thus probable that ''Felagund'' was actually given by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] as a mockery to Finrod, and transmitted by the Dwarves.<ref>{{NM|P3vii}}, p. 304</ref>

An early etymology for ''Felagund'' was ""Lord of Caves"" in [[Noldorin]], from ''[[fela]]'' (""caverns"") + ''[[cunn]]'' (""prince"").<ref>{{LR|P3}}, entries ""KUNDU"", ""PHELEG""</ref>

==Other names==
His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', which was also the mother-name of his father Finarfin. It meant ""''the'' Ñoldo"", 'one-eminent of the kindred' which is in simpler words 'the wise'. It was a name used by his brothers and sister, who loved him.<ref name=""Finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|346, 360}} 

Finrod was also called '''''[[Nóm]]''''' (""Wisdom"") by [[Bëor]] and his [[House of Bëor|people]].<ref name=""West"">{{S|West}}</ref> His other titles include ""the Faithful"", ""the Friend of Men"", ""[[King of Nargothrond]]"", ""[[Lord of Nargothrond]]"".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Finrod""</ref><ref name="":0"">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]] ""The Tale of Years"".</ref>

He was often called by the Eldar '''''Edennil''''' or '''''Atandil''''', which means  ""Friend of Men"" in [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] respectively.<ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 349 (cf. p. 306)</ref> A variant for ''Atandil'' was ''Firindil''.<ref>{{VT|41c}}, p. 14</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier versions of the Middle-earth myths, and when ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was published, the name '''Finrod''' was given to the character later known as [[Finarfin]]. Finrod Felagund was then named '''[[Inglor Felagund]]'''. However, that changed in later drafts, and the character who had the name [[Gildor Inglorion]], in ''The Lord of the Rings'', was unrelated to Finrod despite having a name that means Gildor son of Inglor. Finrod was childless and unmarried during the events of ''The Silmarillion'' because his lover, Amarië, remained in Valinor.<ref>{{S|15}}</ref> 

In one note, while defining the term ''[[vanwa]]'', [[Tolkien]] considered that Felagund, like [[Míriel]], chose ''not'' to return to life because of a special will of their own.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}</ref>{{rp|143}}

In the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is Finrod's brother: this was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and an admitted mistake. Orodreth was actually the son of Angrod and thus Finrod's nephew.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Finrod.jpg|thumb|[[Will Fletcher]] as Finrod in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]

===Television===
'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''
:'''Episode 1: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':''' [[Galadriel]] recalls a memory of her brother during her childhood at the time of the [[Years of the Trees]]. In the memory, after some Elf children bully her and sink her paper swan ship, she attempts to attack one of them. However, Finrod (portrayed by [[Will Fletcher]]) shows up just in time to prevent her from doing any harm.
:Not long after, Finrod is seen talking to Galadriel beneath a tree, where it is revealed that Galadriel had made the ship just as Finrod had taught her. Finrod then asks her if she knows why ships float while stones cannot, and tells her, after a moment of silence, that stones look downwards towards the irresistible darkness of water while ships look upwards towards the light, fighting against the darkness of water, whispering on things it would not know. Galadriel questions Finrod, saying that ""light in the sky"" is sometimes reflected brightly on the surface of water and that it is hard to know which light to follow.  Upon thinking, Finrod whispers to her: ""''Sometimes we cannot know until we have touched the darkness''"". To this, Galadriel ponders that it sounds simple and Finrod tells her that many things are, but she must decide them for herself as he will not always be there to help.
:Not elaborating on this further, Finrod stands up and tells her that their parents are waiting for them, before walking over a hill to reveal the [[Two Trees]]. This exchange, as well as the philosophy which Finrod imparts to Galadriel in it were created for the series because none of this dialogue nor the attitudes it attributes to Finrod are found within any Tolkien's writings.  Later in Galadriel's recollections, Finrod is seen in a battle shouting phrases in [[Quenya]]: ""''Valaron kalanen''"" (""By the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of the [[Valar]]!"") and ""''Firuvantë''"" (""[[Orcs|They]] will die!""). Galadriel mentions that he vowed to destroy [[Sauron]], [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] sorcerer and lieutenant. Yet Sauron found and defeated Finrod first, marking his corpse with a red symbol, which not even the wisest [[Elves]] could decipher, causing Galadriel to take up her brother's vow and dagger for herself.
:None of Galadriel's other brothers are mentioned in the series, and although no specific date is given, the timing and manner of Finrod's death are changed from what is recorded in Tolkien's writings.  Finrod is said to have not died until after Morgoth's defeat, meaning that, in Amazon's continuity, Finrod survives the entirety of the First Age into the Second instead of having died in approximately year 465 of the First Age saving Beren.
:The series does allude to Finrod being killed by wolves with the claw marks on his body, though Galadriel's monologue establishes that it was Sauron who slew him with no mention of werewolves or Beren. This would have been at a a time long after Beren's quest for a Silmaril led him to Nargothrond, seeking Finrod's aid.
:'''Episode 8: ''[[Alloyed]]'':'''
:This Episode features a bizarre scene in which [[Halbrand]] enters [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] mind beside the [[Glanduin]] in Eregion to try to prove to her that he truly desired to redeem himself and heal [[Middle-earth]] of evil, by appearing in the guise of Finrod as she remembered him. Nevertheless, Galadriel refuses to believe that he is redeemable and Halbrand is thrust from her mind and flees [[Eregion]] to the [[Mordor|Southlands]]
:[[Amazon Studios]]'s rights to Finrod's character were limited to his mention in the ''[[Appendices]]'', so the series made significant changes and additions to his story, including showing him taking [[Oath of Fëanor|an oath against Morgoth]] before he left Valinor, and his death at the hands of Sauron, which inspires Galadriel's revenge. It is worth noting that Finrod's death saving Beren is mentioned in ''Appendix B: The Tale of Years'', and so Amazon could have used that material, but still opted to change it to have him dying in pursuit of Sauron.<ref name="":0"" />  Finrod's original personality was particularly wise, very respectful and reverent towards the Valar, rather than as a rebel who advises people to ""touch the darkness"".

'''Finarfin''' was the youngest child and son of [[Finwë]] and [[Indis]] and the third [[King of the Noldor]] in [[Valinor]]. After the [[Flight of the Noldor]], he remained in [[Tirion]] and ruled the Noldor who remained in [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Finarfin''</ref>

==History==
Finarfin was born in [[Valinor]] in {{YT|1230}}.<ref name=""MR|P2j"">{{MR|P2j}}, p. 92</ref>  He was the youngest of the five children of [[Finwë]], the [[King of the Noldor]].  Finarfin's mother was [[Indis]], Finwë's second wife.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>  Finarfin's full siblings were [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], and [[Írimë]] while his half-brother was the great [[Elves|Elf]] Lord [[Fëanor]].  Fëanor disapproved of his father's second marriage and had little love for Indis and her children, although Finarfin remained far from those disputes.<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref>

In {{YT|1280}} Finarfin married [[Eärwen]], daughter of [[Olwë]], King of the [[Teleri]] in [[Valinor]].<ref name=""MR|P2j""/> They had four children: [[Finrod]], [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]] and [[Galadriel]].<ref group=""note"">[[Orodreth]] appears as one of Finarfin's sons in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] writings, however, he was clearly marked as [[Angrod]]'s son. [[Christopher Tolkien]], the editor of ''The Silmarillion'', later admitted the mistake.</ref><ref>{{PM|Gil-galad}}, pp. 349-351</ref> Finarfin's mother was of the [[Vanyar]], and he inherited her fair hair, which he passed on to his children;<ref name=""NM""/><ref>{{PM|Case}}, p. 336</ref> this trait of the '''[[House of Finarfin]]''' was unique among the normally dark haired Noldor.<ref>{{App|F2}}, p. 1137</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, Q ''noldo'', p. 125</ref>

In {{YT|1495}}.<ref>{{MR|P2j}}, p. 100</ref> [[Morgoth|Melkor]] destroyed the [[Two Trees]],<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> slaughtered Finarfin's father Finwë, and stole the [[Silmarils]] of Fëanor. Enraged, Fëanor came to the city of [[Tirion|Tirion upon Túna]] and, in a [[Speech of Fëanor|fiery speech]], convinced many of his kinsmen to leave Valinor for [[Middle-earth]], to recover the Silmarils and defeat Morgoth. Though Finarfin argued for calm and to avoid making a rash decision, the Noldor were persuaded by Fëanor and all but a tithe [[Exile of the Noldor|chose to leave Aman]] and return to Middle-earth.

The [[Noldor]] followed Fëanor in groups, and Fingolfin and Finarfin led the last host. As such they did not participate in the [[First Kinslaying]] or know its true cause at the time. While they were travelling up the coast of [[Araman]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Mandos]] appeared and pronounced the [[Doom of Mandos|Doom of the Noldor]]. Finarfin, dismayed by the prophecy and already contemplating return because of the tragedy of the Kinslaying of his wife's people at [[Alqualondë]], returned to Valinor with a small group of his people; his sons and daughter, though, would not forsake the sons of Fingolfin and went on.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> 
[[File:Maureval - The War of Wrath.jpg|thumb|left|''The War of Wrath'' by Maureval]]
Eventually Finarfin came to [[Middle-earth]], leading the Valinorean Noldor in the [[War of Wrath]], near the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Finarfin.mp3|Ardamir}}

The name ''Finarfin'' is the [[Sindarin]] version of his [[Quenya]] [[father-name]] ''Arafinwë''. The direct equivalence is '''''Arfin'''''.<ref name=""PM|Finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 344</ref> Like his brother Fingolfin, the Sindarized name of his father ''fin'' was added at the beginning.<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 349</ref>

Finarfin's primary name being in Sindarin, a language indigenous to [[Middle-earth]], was a unique occurrence among the [[High Elves]] who remained in the [[Undying Lands]]. Other such Amanya High Elves who stayed behind were primarily known by their [[Quenya]] or [[Telerin]] names. This Sindarin naming was a result of the special position his children had among the Exiles, especially by their being related to King [[Thingol]], and their coming to be collectively known as ''[[Nost Finarfin]]'' (""the children of Finarfin"").<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 31</ref>

==Other names==
His [[father-name]] was '''''Arafinwë''''', with the stem ''[[ara]]-'' (""noble"") added to the name of his father.<ref name=""PM|Finwe""/> 

His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', meaning ""''the Noldo'', one eminent in the kindred"", which also became the mother-name of [[Finrod]].<ref name=Ingoldo>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 30</ref>

In earlier texts ''Ingoldo'' was the mother-name of Fingolfin, whereas Finarfin's was '''''Ingalaurë''''', given to him due his Vanyarin golden hair,<ref name=Ingoldo/> which was even more golden than the Vanyar. Tolkien considered many variants of this name including: ''Lauringa'', ''Lavaringa'', ''Inglawar'', ''Loaringo'', ''Lawarindo'', ''Ingilaur'', ''Inglavar'', ''Vanelaure'', ''Lawaring'', ''Laurin'', ''Ingalaur'', ''Ingwelaure'', and ''Ingalaure''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 118</ref> The Sindarin version of this name was '''''[[Inglor]]'''''.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Finarfin was called ''[[Finrod]]'' in earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], and his son was named '''''[[Inglor Felagund]]'''''. As such he appears in the 1st edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as ''Finrod''. This was changed in later editions, but not all references to '''Inglor''' were removed (see [[Gildor|Gildor '''Inglor'''ion]]).

In some early works, his name is spelled ''Finarphin''.<ref>{{MR|P4}}</ref> An early version of [[Appendix F]], mentions the ""royal house of Finarphir"" which was corrected in later editions.<ref>The form ""Finarphir"" has an entry in {{HM|Guide}}</ref>

'''Galadriel''' was a [[Noldor]]in Lady who witnessed [[Middle-earth]] during the Three [[Ages]]. 

Galadriel was born in [[Aman]] as one of the [[Noldor]]. She was the daughter of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] as well as younger sister to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] (later [[King of Nargothrond]]), [[Angrod]], and [[Aegnor]]. She took part in the [[Exile of the Noldor]], following [[Fëanor]] in his rebellion. However, she opposed the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] with the rest of [[Fingolfin]]'s followers. After arriving in [[Beleriand]], she lived mainly in [[Doriath]], where she befriended [[Melian]]. Later, with her husband [[Celeborn]], she ruled over the [[Silvan Elves|woodland Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]], and together they had a daughter, [[Celebrían]], who married [[Elrond]]. 

She is described as ""the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in [[Middle-earth]]"",<ref name=""Rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref> and the ""greatest of Elven women"".<ref>{{App|B1}}, p. 1082</ref> Throughout the Third Age it was unknown who wielded the [[Three Rings]],<ref name=""Third"">{{App|TA}}, pp. 1085-8</ref> but during the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel revealed to [[Frodo Baggins]] that she was the bearer of [[Nenya]].<ref name=""Mirror"">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>{{rp|365}} After the War, she returned to the [[Uttermost West]].

==History==
===Elder Days===
====Life in Aman====
{{Seealso|#Other versions of the legendarium|l1=Other versions of the legendarium}}
Galadriel was born in [[Eldamar]] in the [[Year of the Trees 1362]].<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 106</ref> She was the fourth child of [[Finarfin]], prince of the [[Noldor]], who named her '''''Artanis'''''.<ref name=""Finwe"">{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 346-7</ref> Her mother was [[Eärwen]], princess of the [[Falathrim|Teleri]], who named her '''''Nerwen''''' (""Man-maiden""). Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Noldor, being strong of body, will, and mind, ""a match for both the [[loremasters]] and the athletes of the [[Eldar]] in the days of their youth.""<ref name=""Case"">{{PM|Case}}, pp. 337-8</ref> 
[[File:Marya Filatova - Galadriel.jpg|left|thumb|''Galadriel'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
Indeed, ""she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats"". This custom was the origin of her [[Sindarin]] [[Epessë|name]] '''''Galadriel''''' (""Maiden crowned with gleaming hair""),<ref name=""Amazon"">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref> which was given to (and accepted by) her much later, in [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 352, note 8</ref> The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]] was held a marvel unmatched. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both [[light]]s of the [[Two Trees]] were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle [[Fëanor]] of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the [[Silmarils]]. He asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Fëanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if Fëanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Fëanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Noldor, including her own.<ref name=""Case"" />

There was still bliss in Valinor when she was born, but soon she was influenced by the [[Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor|unrest of the Noldor]] and lost her inner peace ever after. She was proud, like most of the [[House of Finwë]], and like her closest brother [[Finrod]], ""she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage"". But deep in herself, she had the noble spirit of the [[Vanyar]], which did not allow her to forget the reverence for the [[Valar]].<ref name=""Case"" />

During the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the rebellion of Fëanor, Galadriel was the only woman of the Noldor who stood among the rising princes. She swore no [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]], but the [[Speech of Fëanor|words of Fëanor]] concerning [[Middle-earth]] kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref> Like the rest of the [[House of Finarfin]], she was also supportive of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]] by the desire to aid their [[Sindar]]in relatives in Middle-earth.<ref name=""Case"" /> 

Even though she was one of the leaders in this revolt,<ref name=""RGEO"">{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 60</ref> during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Fëanor by defending her mother's kin during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Fëanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.<ref name=""Case"" /> She kept moving forward even under the [[Doom of Mandos]], when her father Finarfin abandoned the march and returned to Valinor, and even when Fëanor left behind the hosts of Fingolfin and the children of Finarfin. Then she, along with Finrod and [[Fingolfin]] and his sons, led her people into the bitter North and crossed the terrors of [[Helcaraxë]]. After many losses, they arrived on the northern shores of the [[Outer Lands]].<ref name=""Flight"" /><ref group=""note"">The nature of Galadriel's exile (if she was innocent or guilty of pride) and the subsequent idea of a ban upon her return were not defined in Tolkien's first conceptions of Galadriel, so she being a rebel exile was a later reinterpretation. He would also change his mind about it, but for this article we chose this version for having the most complete narratives. For a more complete account of this matter, see the entire ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.</ref>

====Arrival to Middle-earth====
[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|thumb|''Love at First Sight'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]
Once in [[Beleriand]], those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter [[Doriath]], but King [[Elu Thingol]] received the Noldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries.<ref name=""Return"">{{S|13}}</ref> Finally in {{FA|52}},<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]]. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with [[Celeborn]], a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them.<ref name=""Noldor"">{{S|15}}</ref> Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the [[Elven life cycle|custom among the Eldar]] of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war,<ref name=""Scales"">{{NM|P1ix}}, pp. 65-6</ref> but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended.<ref name=""Ages"">{{NM|P1xviii}}, p. 149</ref> Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen [[Melian]], from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth.<ref name=""Return"" />

The Western Corn necessary to make [[lembas]] had been lost in Beleriand until the Noldor brought new grain back, and it flourished by the grace of the Valar. Galadriel was one of the main inheritors of it and of the art of the making of lembas.<ref>{{NM|P3iv}}, p. 296</ref> It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.

Years passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the [[Exile of the Noldor]], but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year {{FA|66|n}},<ref>{{GA|91}}</ref> Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the [[Silmarils]] and how the Noldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of Fëanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Ships at [[Losgar]]. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Noldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Noldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, [[Angrod]] told everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted.<ref name=""Noldor"" />
[[File:Ten Thousand Leaves - Galadriel and Melian.jpeg|thumb|left|''Galadriel and Melian'' by [[:Category:Images by Ten Thousand Leaves|Ten Thousand Leaves]]]]
Despite all this, Galadriel stayed in Doriath until {{FA|102|n}},<ref name=""Nargothrond"">{{GA|108}}</ref> when the kingdom of [[Nargothrond]] was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt for a while in Nargothrond, and in this time she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark [[foresight]]s about his kingdom.<ref name=""Noldor"" /> Back in Doriath, in {{FA|420|n}},<ref>{{GA|129}}</ref> Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about [[Beren|a Man]] who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>

Galadriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]], but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]]; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by [[Sauron]] in the year {{FA|465|n}}.<ref>{{GA|§198-199}}</ref> At some point before the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495|n}},<ref>{{GA|275}}</ref> she and Celeborn passed over [[Blue Mountains|the mountains]]<ref name=""Mirror"" />{{rp|357}} to [[Eriador]], far from the turmoil of the last years of the [[First Age]].

After the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], [[Eönwë]], herald of [[Manwë]], summoned the [[Elves of Beleriand]] to the West, so they were received in [[Tol Eressëa]] and under the pardon of the Valar. However, some did not wish to leave Middle-earth, such as Celeborn.<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|24}}</ref> Being one of the chief leaders of the Noldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return<ref name=""L|297"">{{L|297}}, p. 386</ref> and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.<ref name=""RGEO"" /> The same pride that led her out of Aman still moved her, and she rejected the pardon of the Valar,<ref name=""Case"" /> for as she had once lived in Aman itself, Eressëa seemed only a ""second best"". She was also moved by love for Celeborn, to whom she probably married around this time.<ref name=""Scales"" /><ref group=""note"">The marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn, as well as when they crossed over the mountains, was not well defined by Tolkien. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref>

===Second Age===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Galadriel and Celeborn at Lake Evendim.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel and Celeborn at Lake Evendim'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
At the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel dwelt for a time in [[Lindon]], south of the [[Lune]], while [[Gil-galad]] ruled in the north.<ref name=""Second"">{{App|B1}}, pp. 1082-4</ref> Both left Lindon before the years 10-20, when [[Gil-galad]] became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence.<ref>{{NM|P1xi}}, p. 81</ref> They entered [[Eriador]] and dwelt for a while around [[Lake Nenuial]], being followed by many Noldor, [[Grey-elves]] and [[Green-elves]]. They were considered the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador.<ref name=""Concerning"">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>{{rp|234}} Probably around {{SA|300}},<ref group=""note"">The birth-year of Celebrían was not well defined by Tolkien. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Galadriel and Celeborn had a daughter: [[Celebrían]].<ref name=""Scales"" />

Circa the year {{SA|500|n}}, [[Sauron]] began to stir in Middle-earth again,<ref name=""Second"" /> but his name was not known. He was, however, perceived by Galadriel, who noticed there was a controlling evil, and that it was spreading above the world, coming from the East beyond the [[Misty Mountains]]. She also thought this 'residue of evil' could only be fought with an alliance of all its enemies. Therefore, she and Celeborn moved eastwards and got established in the realm of [[Eregion]] near [[Khazad-dûm]].<ref group=""note"">In the source used here, Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the first founders of Eregion, but later sources mention Celebrimbor as founder and lord of Eregion before their coming. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Celeborn was not fond of [[Dwarves]], but she saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Noldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from [[Yavanna]] and [[Aulë]], the creator of the Dwarves himself.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|235}} 

Some Noldor were also interested in establishing a realm near Khazad-dûm because they knew [[mithril]] had been discovered there. Therefore, many Elven-smiths came to Eregion and created good relations with the Dwarves. [[Celebrimbor]], a descendant of [[Fëanor]] (and therefore a distant cousin of Galadriel), was the greatest of the craft-men and the Lord of Eregion.<ref name=""Second"" /> He was its main builder and in {{SA|750|n}} [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the main city of the realm, was begun. The power of Galadriel and Celeborn also grew: thanks to the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, they had contact with the [[Nandor]]in realm of [[Lórinand]], on the other side of the Misty Mountains. Thanks to Galadriel's influence upon Lórinand, Sauron's machinations there were fruitless.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|236}} She also got in contact with [[Númenor]], having a meeting with King [[Aldarion]] when he came to [[Tharbad]] around {{SA|883|n}}-884.<ref>{{UT|4}}, ''The further course of the narrative'', pp. 205-6</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel in Moria.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel in Moria'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
About the year {{SA|1200|n}}, Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|236}} Galadriel was not deceived, and rejected him, saying that he was not in the training of Aulë as he claimed.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ""Notes"", p. 254, note 7</ref> ""''He perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy''"". At the same time, without her knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and his [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] against Galadriel and Celeborn. Finally, he moved them to expell Galadriel from Eregion at some time between {{SA|1350|n}} and 1400.<ref group=""note"">As in the previous note, the source used here presents Celebrimbor as a subordinate of Galadriel and Celeborn, so in this episode he leads a coup against them.</ref> Thus, Galadriel and Celebrían left through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|237}}

When Sauron made [[the One Ring]] in {{SA|1600}}, his treachery was discovered by Celebrimbor.<ref name=""Second"" /> The elven-smith came to Lórinand, seeking counsel from Galadriel. They did not find the strength to destroy the [[Rings of Power]], but she advised him to hide the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves where Sauron could not find them. Therefore he gave her [[Nenya]], the White Ring, and the other Rings were given to other Elven lords.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|237}} This was done in {{SA|1693|n}}, the same year Sauron began [[War of the Elves and Sauron|the war against the Elves]].<ref name=""Second"" />

With the invasion of Eriador, [[Sack of Eregion|Eregion was destroyed]] and Celebrimbor killed. Despite using torture, Sauron could not learn from him where the Elven Rings were, although he suspected they were kept by Galadriel and Gil-galad.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|238}} But thanks to the military intervention of [[Númenor]], Sauron was defeated in {{SA|1700|n}}.<ref name=""Second"" /> Soon afterwards, Galadriel was affected by [[sea-longing]], and she decided to leave Lórinand and dwell beside the sea.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|240}} As one of the [[High-elves]], her yearning for the sea was unavoidable, and now she became burdened with the desire to cross to the Blessed Realm, but the ban upon her impeded it.<ref name=""RGEO"" /> Thus she did not go to the sea yet, but crossed west of the mountains through Khazad-dûm with Celebrían. Seeking Celeborn, they travelled to [[Imladris]], a refuge created by [[Elrond]] during the war. Once there, a [[White Council|Council]] was held, in which it was decided that Imladris would be the Elvish stronghold in the East, rather than the desolate Eregion.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|239–40}}

Galadriel, Celeborn and Celebrían dwelt a long time in Imladris, but at some point they left and moved near the sea, to [[Belfalas]], at the place later known as [[Dol Amroth]]. There were few inhabitants there, but they were visited by Nandorin parties.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|238}} Apparently, they returned to Lórien twice before the [[Last Alliance]] and the end of the Second Age,<ref name=""Amroth"">{{UT|Amroth}}, pp. 243-5</ref> but of their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age nothing else is known.

===Third Age===
====Rule in Lórien====
In early [[Third Age]], in the year {{TA|109|n}}, Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter [[Celebrían]] wedded [[Elrond]] the [[Half-elven]].<ref name=""Third"" /> But they did not stay at first with her, for Galadriel was filled with [[Foresight|foreboding]], and was concerned about the growing shadow in [[Mirkwood]] and [[Dol Guldur]]. Therefore she and Celeborn made long journeys investigating [[Rhovanion]], going from [[Gondor]] and the borders of [[Mordor]] to [[Thranduil]] in the north. They also stayed a long time in Lórien with king [[Amroth]], for Galadriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.<ref name=""Amroth"" /> At this point, the [[Istari]] arrived in Middle-earth, and only Galadriel, Elrond and [[Círdan]] knew [[Valinor|where]] they came from.<ref name=""Rings"" /> Around the year {{TA|1100|n}}, the [[Wise]] (including Galadriel as one the chief Eldar) were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol Guldur, but thought it was one of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref name=""Third"" />

After their enquiries, Galadriel and Celeborn passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.<ref name=""Amroth"" />

Between the years {{TA|1980}}-{{TA|1981|n}}, [[Durin's Bane|a terror]] appeared in Khazad-dûm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many Silvan Elves from Lórien had to flee south.<ref name=""Third"" /> To make things worse, Amroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore Celeborn and Galadriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the [[King of Lórien|royal title]] and were called the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]]. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.<ref name=""Amroth"" />

As the shadow of Dol Guldur grew again, the [[White Council]] was formed in {{TA|2463|n}}.<ref name=""Third"" /> It was summoned by Galadriel,<ref>{{FR|II7}}, p. 357</ref> who, being a good friend of [[Gandalf]], recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to [[Saruman]].<ref name=""Rings"" /> 

In {{TA|2510|n}}, her daughter Celebrían departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.<ref name=""Third"" /> The same year, she aided [[Eorl]] and his [[Rohirrim|riders]] in the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol Guldur.<ref>{{UT|8b}}, pp. 298-9</ref>

The White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was [[Sauron]]. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=""Third"" />

Some years later, [[Aragorn]] entered Lothlórien after many travels, and was admitted by Galadriel. She bade him change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. At that time, Aragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter [[Arwen]].<ref>{{App|A1v}}, p. 1060</ref>

====War of the Ring====
[[File:Ralph Damiani - The Trial.png|thumb|right|''The Trial'' by [[:Category:Images by Ralph Damiani|Ralph Damiani]]]]
Galadriel and Celeborn were well informed about the [[Company of the Ring]], its members and their mission, before its coming to Lothlórien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell.<ref>{{FR|II6}}, p. 350</ref> In the evening of [[17 January]] of {{TA|3019}}, the Company arrived at [[Caras Galadhon]].<ref name=""Great"">{{App|B3}}, pp. 1092-4</ref> Coming to the [[talan]] of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered [[Durin's Bane]] and that this was in fact a [[Balrog]] from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards [[Gimli]], who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.<ref name=""Mirror"" />{{rp|354–7}}

A month later, in [[15 February]],<ref name=""Great"" /> [[Frodo Baggins]] the [[Ringbearer|bearer of the One Ring]], was walking in the evening with [[Sam]] when they encountered Galadriel. She led them to an enclosed garden and showed them a silver basin. Filling it with water, a [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]] was formed, which allowed them to see things that were and that might come. Frodo saw the [[Eye of Sauron]], and she explained that she knew well Frodo's mind, for Sauron also tried to look into hers. She also [[Keepers of the Three Rings|kept]] a [[Ring of Power]], and showing him [[Nenya]], the Ring of Adamant, she explained that its power would disappear once Frodo destroyed the One, and Lórien would fade. Then Frodo offered the One Ring to her, and she laughed in response, saying: ""''I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer.''"" Then she began to ponder how powerful she would become with the Ring's power, and from Nenya came a great light that covered her overwhelming height. But the light faded and she laughed again, saying: ""''I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel''.""<ref name=""Mirror"" />{{rp|360–6}} Indeed, with this rejection of temptation and her long opposition against Sauron, the ban upon her return to Aman was finally lifted.<ref name=""RGEO"" />

That night, the Lord and Lady summoned the Company and spoke of their departure, which was appointed for the following morning. The next day, she sent the Fellowship off on their Quest, furnished with [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] for all the members, including [[lembas]] and [[Elven cloaks]]. Later, a farewell party was held, which the Lord and Lady attended in a [[Swan-ships|swan boat]]; from it, Galadriel sang a [[Galadriel's Song|song]] about [[Eldamar]]. After everyone ate and drank, she proceed to give [[Gifts of Galadriel|specific gifts]] to each member.<ref name=""Farewell"">{{FR|II8}}, pp. 367-78</ref>

Among the gifts was the [[Elfstone]], which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen ""''as a token of hope''"".<ref name=""Farewell"" /> The jewel was also in part a bridal gift and a token of the future wedding of Arwen and Aragorn, done following the [[Elven customs|Noldorin custom]] in which the bride's mother should give to the bridegroom a jewel (Arwen's mother Celebrían had departed long ago, so Galadriel did it in her place).<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}, p. 211</ref> Galadriel stated she was unsure as to what to give Gimli, and asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]]. Instead, she rewarded him with three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her. And last, to Frodo, she gave a [[Phial of Galadriel|a small crystal phial]] specially prepared by her, which contained the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of the [[star of Eärendil]].<ref name=""Farewell"" />

The Company saw her one last time while sailing down to the [[Anduin]]: a shining figure, all clad in white, raising her arms, and Frodo was able to hear her clearly reciting [[Namárië|a long poem in Elvish]] despite the distance.<ref name=""Farewell"" />

On [[17 February|the following day]], a resurrected Gandalf was brought to Lórien by [[Gwaihir]],<ref name=""Great"" /> who was sent by Galadriel. He was received in Caras Galadhon, and was healed and clothed in white. He also took and gave counsel. Before he left, Galadriel gave him [[Galadriel's messages|some prophetic messages]] for Aragorn, [[Legolas]] and Gimli.<ref>{{TT|III5}}, pp. 502-3</ref>

The land of Lórien was not exempt from the battles of the [[War of the Ring]]: between [[11 March|11]] and [[18 March]], the [[Galadhrim]] suffered [[assaults on Lothlórien|three assaults]] from Dol Guldur.<ref name=""Great"" /> After the [[Fall of Barad-dûr]], Celeborn crossed the Anduin with a host and began the [[Fall of Dol Guldur|destruction of Dol Guldur]].<ref name=""Chief"">{{App|B4}}, pp. 1095-6</ref> Soon afterward, Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.<ref name=""Great"" />

====Later history====
[[File:Victoria Clare - On the Road to the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''On the Road to the Grey Havens'' by [[:Category:Images by Victoria Clare|Victoria Clare]]]]
Galadriel, Celeborn and their company attended the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. Soon afterward they joined the crowded funeral riding of King [[Théoden]] to [[Rohan]]. After the funerals in the [[Golden Hall]], they continued their travel northwards with other companions and halted in [[Isengard]]. [[Treebeard]] reveals that he had freed Saruman, and regrets that he will not see Galadriel and [[Celeborn]] again. Celeborn replied that he is unsure but Galadriel affirmed that it would be her last meeting with him, giving Treebeard some [[Arda Healed|cryptic words]]. They continued on their way and encountered [[Saruman]], who, released by [[Fangorn]], snapped that she always had hated him, and now he would find comfort knowing that her realm was destroyed as well as his.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}, pp. 976, 983, 985</ref>

Two years later, on [[22 September]] {{TA|3021|n}},<ref name=""Chief"" /> Frodo and Sam encountered a [[Wandering Companies|Wandering Company]] while travelling around [[the Shire]], and found that Elrond, Galadriel and [[Bilbo]] were part of it. Nenya was visible on Galadriel's finger, and she seemed to shine like the moon. Frodo decided to depart with them and the hobbits joined the company, led by Elrond and Galadriel.<ref name=""Havens"">{{RK|VI9}}, pp. 1027-30</ref> On [[29 September]], they reached the [[Grey Havens]] and departed over the Sea. Thus ended the [[Third Age]].<ref name=""Chief"" />

Sometime later during the [[Fourth Age]], she received Celeborn, her husband.<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}, pp. 15-6</ref> And in {{FoA|120}},<ref>{{App|B5}}, p. 1098</ref> it is said that [[Gimli]] went to the West out of his desire to see Galadriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.<ref>{{App|A3}}, p. 1081</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Galadriel.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Galadriel'' is a [[Sindarin]] name translated by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] as ""maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance"",<ref name=""Finwe"" /> ""Maiden crowned with gleaming hair"",<ref name=""Amazon"" /> ""glittering garland"",<ref>{{L|345}}, p. 423</ref> and ""maiden crowned with a radiant garland"".<ref name=""SApp"">{{S|Appendix}}, ''kal-''</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 44-5</ref> ''Galadriel'' consists of ''[[galad]]'' (""light, radiance"") + ''[[rî]]'' (""crown"").<ref name=""Finwe"" /> It was an [[epessë]] given to her in her youth because, while doing exercise, she usually bound up her long golden hair as a crown.<ref name=""Amazon"">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref>

Tolkien notes that the element ''galad'' had no relation to Sindarin ''[[galadh]]'' or [[Silvan]] ''galað'' (""tree"").<ref name=""SApp"" /><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, p. 182 (commentary to §42)</ref> Due to this coincidence the name ''Galadriel'' was occasionally rendered as '''''Galadhriel''''', as Tolkien explains:
{{blockquote|When Celeborn and Galadriel became the rulers of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Galadhrim]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, the name of Galadriel became associated with trees, an association that was aided by the name of her husband, which also appeared to contain a tree-word; so that outside [[Lórien]] among those whose memories of the ancient days and Galadriel's history had grown dim her name was often altered to 'Galadhriel', though never in Lórien itself.<ref>{{UT|6e}}, p. 267</ref>}}

==Other names==
At the time of her birth, [[Finarfin]] named his only daughter '''''Artanis'''''. Her [[father-name]] meant ""Noble Woman"" in [[Quenya]], from ''[[arta]]'' + ''[[nís]]''.<ref name=""Finwe"" />

Due to Artanis's height and her great strength of body and will, Eärwen chose the [[Quenya]] name '''''Nerwen''''', meaning ""man-maiden"".<ref name=""Case"" />

'''''Alatáriel''''' was the [[Telerin]] name given to Galadriel by [[Celeborn]], meaning ""Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland"", which referred to her hair.<ref name=""Finwe"" /> The Quenya form of this name was '''''Altáriel''''', although the proper form would have been '''''Ñaltariel'''''. Its [[Sindarin]] cognate '''''Galadriel''''' was chosen by her to be her Sindarin name, because it was the most beautiful of her names and had been given to her as an [[epessë]] by her lover, Teleporno of the Teleri, whom she wedded later in Beleriand.<ref name=""Finwe"" /><ref group=""note"">''Teleporno'' was the Teleri-styled named for Lord Celeborn: ""It is only of course in the late version that Celeborn appears with a High-elven, rather than Sindarin, name: ''Teleporno''"", {{UT|6e}}, p. 266</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel sketch'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
{{quote|There is no part of the history of Middle-earth more full of problems than the story of Galadriel and Celeborn...|[[Christopher Tolkien]] in ""[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]""}}

===The History of ''The Lord of the Rings''===
The first appearance of the character of Galadriel in the [[legendarium]] was during the composition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The first reference [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ever made to her was in some notes for the ""[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]"" chapter, which mentioned that a ""Lord of Galadrim and a Lady"" went to the White Council. The following phrases are a stub of them receiving the Company of the Ring, both clad in white and with white hair. In other isolated notes about this chapter, Tolkien wondered ""if Galadriel is alone and is wife of Elrond.""<ref>{{TI|XII}}, pp. 233, 236</ref>

The first mention of ""Keleborn and Galadriel"" by name was in the narrative of the [[The Mirror of Galadriel|following chapter]], although Tolkien considered other Elvish names before writing ''Galadriel'' in ink.<ref name=""Galadriel"">{{TI|XIII}}</ref>{{rp|261}} There Galadriel describes Keleborn and herself as ""''wise beyond the measure of the Elves of Middle-earth''"", and says that they ""''have dwelt there since the Mountains were reared and the Sun was young''"", from which [[Christopher Tolkien]] deduced they were both conceived as [[exiled Noldor]].<ref name=""Galadriel"" />{{rp|263}} After the episode with the Company, both names are changed, so she became ''Galadrien'' (""tree-lady"") in the next pages.<ref name=""Galadriel"" />{{rp|249}} Other notable details that were altered later include the white colour of her hair,<ref name=""Galadriel"" />{{rp|256}} that she was the keeper of the [[Ring of Earth]],<ref name=""Galadriel"" />{{rp|252}} and that after the departure of the Company, Frodo was supposed to never see Galadriel ever again.<ref>{{TI|XIVviii}}, p. 286</ref>

In a list of matters ""to be explained before the end"", Tolkien wondered about what happened with Galadriel after the War of the Ring:

{{blockquote|They learn [...] that Nazgûl razed Lórien and Keleborn fled with a remnant to [[Mirkwood]]. Galadriel was lost or was hidden. Or shall Lórien be left slowly to fade? Yes. Galadriel parts with Keleborn who elects to stay in the world and [?woods]. She is seen by Frodo in old age, when he and Sam see Galadriel and Bilbo...<ref>{{TI|XXVI}}, p. 451, note 18</ref>}}

In sum, earlier and rejected names during the composition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were ''Finduilas'', ''Rhien'', ''Galdrin'', ''Galdrien'', ''Galadhrien'', and ''Galadrien''.<ref>{{TI|Index}}, p. 480, entry ""Galadriel""</ref>

===Expanding the First Age===
In the [[Appendix F]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien had already stated that Galadriel was ""of the royal house of Finrod, father of Felagund, Lord of Nargothrond"" (in the Second Edition, Tolkien changed the names to ''Finarfin'' and ''Finrod Felagund'', respectively). Although not using much detail, Tolkien was thus introducing Galadriel in ""The Silmarillion"" tradition, and having finished ''The Lord of the Rings'', he began the work of expanding the backstory of the character. Galadriel enters this tradition in the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', in which she is first mentioned when Tolkien decided the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) would be related to Thingol through Eärwen.<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 104, §85</ref> In the ''Annals'', written after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'',<ref>{{MR|P2}}, p. 48</ref> Galadriel stands out by being valiant and the only woman leading the Exile of the Noldor,<ref>{{AA|§135, 163}}</ref> but there is no explanation of the nature of her rebellion or its later impact on her life.

Indeed, [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that when the chapter ""Farewell to Lórien"" was written, his father had not conceived the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return due to her role in the Flight of the Noldor.<ref name=""History"">{{UT|6}}, pp. 228-9</ref> In a letter from [[1953]] (even before ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published), Tolkien did not object to the comparison of Galadriel with the [[Virgin Mary]],<ref>{{L|142}}, p. 172</ref> [[#Rebel exile|a comparison he would object]] to later. 

Written in the same years, the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' follow the ''Annals of Aman'', telling the chronology of Beleriand, mainly after the Return of the Noldor. Here Galadriel's rol is briefly expanded, limited to her relation with Melian and a conversation with her brother Finrod.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 35, 40-2, 44, 50</ref> The darkness pending upon all the Noldor is explicitly mentioned, but the same happens with the innocence of the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) during the discussions with Thingol and Melian. Sadly, Tolkien left these ''Annals'' unfinished at the point of the [[Wanderings of Húrin]], so nothing is told about Galadriel at the end of the First Age, neither about her relation with Celeborn.<ref group=""note"">Notice that both ''Annals'' were (on the matter of Galadriel) the source used by Christopher Tolkien for his edition of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''. For more details see ''[[#The published Silmarillion]]''.</ref>

===Expanding the Second Age===
After the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien most expanded the story of Galadriel in the Second Age in ""[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]"". This manuscript is the only full narrative dealing with this matter, but sadly it is a stub full of corrections, and Tolkien never solved some contradictions that would be raised later.<ref group=""note"">Notice that this text is the main source for the ""[[#Second Age|Second Age]]"" section of this article, in which the contradictions have been deliberately overlooked. For more details see ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Christopher comments that what is now remarkable is that there is still no presence of the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return: she stays in Middle-earth out of her love for Celeborn. There could be some pride on her part, as she was eager to visit Middle-earth, but later she stays in Eriador after the first fall of Sauron as a sort of duty until he was finally defeated.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|233–4}}

The first clear mention of pride in Galadriel's decision is probably in one of many manuscripts written c. [[1959]] dealing with Elven growing. In this text it is briefly mentioned that Galadriel rejected coming back to the West and live in [[Eressëa]], moved by her love for Celeborn and (told in a footnote) maybe by her pride, as she had lived in Aman as a princess, so the Lonely Isle would be a ""second best"".<ref name=""Scales"" /> We see here that she was allowed to return to the West, but limited to Eressëa, far from the blessed lands (this is, Valinor and Eldamar). There is a sort of ban, not particularly against her, but her pride stands out, as it will become in an essential aspect of her character in the following ""phase"" of her development.

===Rebel exile===
In mid-[[1967]], Tolkien wrote long drafts of a letter, in which he first mentioned the idea of Galadriel not being allowed to return after the First Age as a punishment for being one of the leaders of the Noldor rebellion. Also, in a footnote, he interprets the ''[[Namárië]]'' as Galadriel's wish that Frodo might go West, as she cannot, believing she is to remain in Middle-earth forever. And more radically, Tolkien interprets the test of the Ring as granting Galadriel permission to return to Aman.<ref name=""L|297"" /> Christopher Tolkien does not believe that this letter is proof that the ban was present when such passages were written.<ref name=""History"" /> Given all this, we can well affirm that what is said in this letter are reinterpretations made a posteriori.

Just two months later, ''[[The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle]]'' was published in the United States, in which Tolkien included a brief biography of Galadriel in notes to the ''Namárië''. Not only the Elvish poem, but the line ""''What ship will carry me again across such a wide sea?''"" of the poem mentioned above, are interpreted here as expressions of Galadriel's longing, unable to return to the West. Her arrogance is connected to her rebellious role, since she replied proudly to the prohibition by saying she had no desire to return.<ref name=""RGEO"" />

It is strange that Tolkien's new vision was so clear at this time, since there does not seem to be any intermediate text in which he considered this version or others. Now, he would go ahead with this vision, so it would also affect the character's background in the First Age.

Written in [[1968]] or later, ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' includes a long passage about Galadriel during her life in Aman and during the Exile. It is the first place that highlights her enmity with Fëanor before the Exile, and also her independence from him, since her desire to see and rule distant lands was already present in her before Fëanor's speech. Her role during the Flight of the Noldor is described as courageous and blameless: she had a legitimate desire to help her Teleri kin in Middle-earth, and she fought fiercely against Fëanor in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. However, she is guilty of pride, not only in her departure, as here she is granted forgiveness after Morgoth's defeat, but she rejects it.<ref name=""Case"" />

A few years later, in [[1971]], we see that this conception of Galadriel still remains. In response to a letter, Tolkien acknowledges the influence of the figure of the Virgin Mary on the character of Galadriel, but now points out a radical difference: Galadriel was a penitent with a past marked by pride and rebellion against divine authorities.<ref>{{L|320}}, p. 407</ref>

===Unstained exile===
In a letter written in August [[1973]] (one month before his death), Tolkien gave a completely different description of Galadriel: 

{{blockquote|Galadriel was 'unstained': she had committed no evil deeds. She was an enemy of Fëanor. She did not reach Middle-earth with the other Noldor, but independently. Her reasons for desiring to go to Middle-earth were legitimate, and she would have been permitted to depart, but for the misfortune that before she set out the revolt of Fëanor broke out, and she became involved in the desperate measures of Manwë, and the ban on all emigrations.<ref>{{L|353}}, p. 431</ref>}}
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Artanis sketch.jpg|thumb|''Artanis'' by [[:Category:Images by Elena Kukanova|Elena Kukanova]]]]
This was not an isolated idea; around the same time he wrote an outline of the revised backstory of Galadriel, which he could not carry into narrative, as it ended up being probably his last writing related to the legendarium. Here Galadriel is described as totally opposed to Fëanor from the beginning, and she felt confined in Aman and desired to depart to Middle-earth in order to exercise her talents: ""for being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the Valar thought fit to give the Eldar"". Manwë was probably aware of her desire and he had not forbidden her to depart, nor given permission yet. Nonetheless, Galadriel did not remain inactive and thought in the ships of the Teleri, so she dwelt in Alqualondë with her mother's kin. There she met Celeborn (here a Telerin prince and her cousin), and both planned to build a boat and seek the permission of the Valar to depart to Middle-earth. 

But then Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the [[Two Trees]], and Fëanor began his rebellion, in which Galadriel had no part. ""Indeed, she and Celeborn fought heroically in defence of Alqualondë against the assault of the Noldor, and Celeborn's ship was saved from them"". Now Galadriel sailed in despair without asking Manwë, and indeed she would have been told to stay in Valinor in that hour, despite her desire being legitimate; and thus the ban against departure fell upon her and she was forbidden to return. She and Celeborn reached Middle-earth before Fëanor, finding Círdan's haven and being received with joy. They did not join the war against Morgoth, which they considered hopeless without the help of the Valar, and instead they recommended going eastwards and befriending the [[Dark Elves]] and Men living there. But the Elves of Beleriand did not heed these counsels, so both of them crossed the Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age. They were granted permission to return by the Valar, but they rejected it.

Christopher Tolkien explains that this change probably had its roots in the philosophical implications of Galadriel's power in Middle-earth. He is certain that his father had the intention of changing all the narrative of ""The Silmarillion"" related to the backstory of Galadriel, despite what was already written: after all, she was not part of the story of the Noldor in the first place and the book had not been published. The only notable problem is in the backstory of Celeborn, which contradicts what was already published in J.R.R. Tolkien's life.<ref name=""History"" />{{rp|231–3}}

===Unsolved contradictions===
As can be seen, the development of Galadriel throughout Tolkien's texts is mainly structured around the nature of her exile and ban from Aman. In this subsection we present other aspects of her that are better explained separately for order's sake. In the mentioned texts there are some loose contradictions that can be easily explained as mere mistakes. A noticeable case is Galadriel using [[Nenya]] during the Second Age in ""[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]"", which contradicts everything we know about the [[Rings of Power]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''. On the contrary, the contradictions presented in this subsection result from the several revisions and we cannot know how Tolkien would have solved them.

;:Galadriel in Nargothrond
In the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' it is written that Galadriel went from Doriath to Nargothrond ""and dwelt there for a while"" after Finrod had completed its building.<ref name=""Nargothrond"" /> But while expanding the ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Tolkien wrote: ""Yet Galadriel his sister went never to Nargothrond, for she remained long in Doriath"", and revised it with ""Yet Galaðriel his sister dwelt never in Nargothrond"".<ref>{{WJ|10}}, p. 178</ref> It is unclear which version was written as definitive, but Christopher Tolkien chose the former one for [[Of the Noldor in Beleriand|Chapter 15]] of his edition of ''The Silmarillion''.

;:Passing over the mountains
Christopher Tolkien explains that in the first conception, Galadriel went to the east from Beleriand alone and found Celeborn (probably of [[Nandor]]in origin) in Lórien. Hence in the chapter ""[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]"" she said Celeborn dwelt in the West before the Dawn, and that she crossed the mountains from Beleriand (apparently alone). This contradicts the information in [[Appendix B]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', in which Celeborn is a Sinda who accompanied Galadriel from Lindon.<ref name=""History"" />{{rp|228}}

The time when she passed over the mountains is also contradictory, as Galadriel said that it was ""''ere the fall of Nargothrond and Gondolin''"", yet in Appendix B it is stated that at the beginning of the Second Age she was still dwelling in Lindon, before passing over the mountains. This contradiction in the same work must have been due to a mistake during revision.<ref group=""note"">It is possible, however, that Galadriel first left Beleriand to avoid the cataclysmic war, later came to Lindon to join the surviving exiles, and crossed the Ered Luin again looking for a settlement.</ref>

;:Marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn
In Appendix B, while describing the beginning of the Second Age, it is said that Celeborn dwelt in [[Harlindon|south Lindon]] with his wife Galadriel, so it appears that they were married at this point.<ref name=""Second"" /> In a manuscript from c. [[1959]], Tolkien said that Galadriel and Celeborn probably married ""soon after the overthrow of Morgoth"", before they crossed the Mountains.<ref name=""Scales"" /> Another manuscript from the same period states the same, but in its following notes Tolkien wrote that Galadriel did not marry Celeborn until they were settled (in Lake Nenuial, as understood by the context).<ref>{{NM|P1x}}, p. 73</ref> In a manuscript from [[1965]], while Tolkien pondered about Amroth being their child, he wrote that Galadriel and Celeborn were betrothed, but did not marry until the confusion of the War of Wrath and the beginning of the Second Age had ended (till S.A. 24).<ref name=""Ages"" />

;:Birth-year of Celebrían
The year and the place of Celebrían's birth was never definite. Tolkien considered as early as year 9 of the Second Age, and as late as 350 (850 was also considered, but as a mere conjecture). For details and references see ''[[Celebrían#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.

;:Mother of Amroth
In ""Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn"", both Celebrían and [[Amroth]] are children of Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref name=""Concerning"" /> but in later texts dating from [[1969]], Tolkien made Amroth the son of [[Amdír]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 244</ref> For more details see ''[[Amroth#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.

;:Founder of Eregion
In Appendix B, it is said that at the beginning of the Second Age, the Noldor went to [[Eregion]] out of their interest for the [[mithril]] in [[Moria]]. Besides, Celebrimbor is called ""Lord of Eregion"", with no mention of his relation with Galadriel.<ref name=""Second"" /> In ""Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn"", Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the founders of Eregion, a place chosen by Galadriel out of her desire to gather the Elven and the Dwarvish races against the increasing evil in Middle-earth. Celebrimbor is the chief builder of the realm, but is not mentioned as its lord, although he later seizes the power there.<ref name=""Concerning"" />{{rp|235–7}} Celebrimbor as the founder appears only in a linguistic work, in which Tolkien simply mentions ""the settlement at Eregion under Celebrimbor"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 53</ref> It is unclear if these texts are necessarily contradictory, but it is clear that trying to explain the rule in Eregion remains problematic.

===The published ''Silmarillion''===
Christopher Tolkien was aware of his father's [[#Unstained exile|latest conception]], in which Galadriel left Aman free of any guilt. However, as this was a mere projected idea, he had to make use of the completed narratives for his edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in which she is a rebel leader.<ref name=""History"" />{{rp|232–3}} It is notable that in this work there is no explanation of Galadriel's reasons for remaining in Middle-earth after the War of Wrath, save that Celeborn was unwilling to leave,<ref name=""Earendil"" /> nor is there any mention of a ban against her return or her concerns about the remaining evil. This way, Christopher did not choose any particular position and let the reader guess, but also stripped this character of all development in relation to ''The Lord of the Rings''.

[[Douglas C. Kane]] noted that Christopher Tolkien, for his edition, removed some statements on Galadriel from his father's work: [[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië|Chapter 5]]'s original text said that Galadriel was ""the most valiant"" lady of the [[house of Finwë]]; and [[Of the Flight of the Noldor|Chapter 9]]'s mentioned her as ""Galadriel the valiant and fair"". According to Kane, Galadriel is not the only female character inexplicably diminished by Christopher's editorial choices.<ref>[[Douglas C. Kane]], ''[[Arda Reconstructed: The Creation of the Published Silmarillion]]'' ([[2009]]), pp. 74, 114, 252</ref>

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Galadriel is voiced by [[Annette Crosbie]].

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Galadriel is played by [[Cate Blanchett]]. Galadriel narrates the [[Prologue: One Ring to Rule Them All...|Prologue]], explaining the creation of the Rings of Power and the War of the Last Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Galadriel frequently consults [[ósanwë|telepathically]] with Elrond; in the books there is no clear indication of how Galadriel knew about the coming of the Fellowship. In the film, unlike the book, Galadriel and [[Elrond]] send an army of [[Elves]] - led by [[Haldir]] - to [[Battle of the Hornburg|Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim]]. In the DVD commentary, [[Peter Jackson]] and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves do not seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screen time and resources.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelob's Lair soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him. She is later seen leaving Middle-earth along with other Ring-bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel, although the character is absent from the novel.<ref name=""PJCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> She appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside [[Saruman]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Elrond]]. Later, right before [[Thorin and Company|Thorin and his Company]] enter in [[Mirkwood]], she telepathically urges Gandalf to further seek the true identity of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Finally, during the [[attack on Dol Guldur]], Galadriel plays a larger role. She first rescues Gandalf from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Sauron from the fortress using her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], although weakened by the amount of power she used.

===Television===
'''1993: [[Hobitit]]:'''
:Galadriel is portrayed by [[Heidi Krohn]]. She appears only in the episode ''Lórien'', and she is featured as a reflection on the surface of the lake.

'''2022: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]:'''
{{Quote|'''Galadriel''' - A legendary elven warrior and the Commander of the Northern Armies. Far from the wise, ethereal Lady of Lórien she will one day become, this much younger Galadriel is headstrong and relentless – and obsessed with hunting an elusive evil.|Official description}}

===Radio series===
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by [[Marian Diamond]]. In addition to the Lothlórien episodes, the voice of Galadriel is heard in Shelob's Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Elrond in the final episode in the Shire, as they journey towards the Grey Havens.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by Soňa Norisová. Norisová also provides most of the singing in the series (including the opening and closing titles theme and series closing song), alluding to Galadriel being a secondary storyteller (with Bilbo Baggins serving as the series' primary storyteller).

===Games===
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Galadriel, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]], is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Galadriel is the strongest of ""Hero"" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot [[Gollum]] on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to ""summon"" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'', Galadriel plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline with guidance and support. During the final days of the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel assembles the Council of Elven Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against [[Dol Guldur]]. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Galadriel accompanies Arwen on her journey south to her wedding, and they visit the site of [[Celebrian]]'s captivity in the [[Misty Mountains]] together. Afterwards, she and Celeborn join the procession of [[Elrond]]'s house and travel to [[Minas Tirith]] to attend the wedding of Arwen and Aragorn.

'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character. She is voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] and she narrates the prologue in a showing of the game.

'''2017: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]:'''
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character, with [[Jennifer Hale]] reprising her role from the game.

'''Ereinion Gil-galad''' was the fourth and last [[High King of the Noldor]] in [[Middle-earth]]. 

==History==
===First Age===
Gil-galad was ''either''<sup>[[#Parentage|NB]]</sup> the son of [[Orodreth]] and grandson of [[Angrod]] and [[Eldalótë]],<ref name=Galad>{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 346-8 & 364</ref> or the son of [[Fingon]] and thus grandson of [[Fingolfin]],<ref name=Fingon>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> since there were different accounts about his actual parentage, while the precise year and place of his birth invariably remained murky (see ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium|below]]'').

In any case, he was still an [[Elven life cycle|elven-child]] at the time of the [[Dagor Bragollach]] when [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]] in {{FA|455}}. As a result, shortly after the [[fall of Fingolfin]] a [[First Age 456|year later]], his father sent his wife and son to [[Círdan]] at the [[Havens of the Falas]] for safekeeping. After the capture of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] by the forces of [[Sauron]], the [[Pass of Sirion]] was open to Morgoth's hosts, although they were still kept at bay by the still mighty realm of [[Hithlum]] and also the power of [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=Fingon/><ref>{{GA|145-59}}, pp. 52-6</ref>

But at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] in {{FA|472}}, the [[Union of Maedhros]] was utterly defeated and [[Fingon]], High King of the Noldor, slain by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] the Lord of [[Balrogs]], so the crown passed to Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] in [[Gondolin]]. After Hithlum was destroyed and occupied by the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]], there was no power left that could withstand the enemies, and the ports at the Falas were [[Fall of the Falas|besieged and captured]] by the [[Orcs]] in {{FA|473|n}}. Yet Círdan, Gil-galad, and many other Elves could flee from death on ship and established a refuge upon the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref><ref>{{GA|217-57}}, pp. 71-80</ref>
[[File:Marya Filatova - Gil-galad and Idril with Earendil.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Gil-galad and Idril with Eärendil'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
Gil-galad finally received the [[High King of the Noldor|Kingship of the Noldor]] in {{FA|510}}, when Gondolin [[Fall of Gondolin|was lost]] and Turgon died.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> Beside the refuge upon Balar, he and Círdan also maintained the small, hidden port at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], where many refugees from Nargothrond, [[Doriath]], and Gondolin were sheltered, until the [[War of Wrath]] ravaged between {{FA|545|n}} and {{FA|587|n}} at the very end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref><ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 346</ref>

===Second Age===
After the destruction of [[Beleriand]] during the War of Wrath, which marked the beginning of the [[Second Age]], Gil-galad founded a kingdom in [[Lindon]] in the far north-west of Middle-earth, roughly between the [[Blue Mountains]] and the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] around the [[Gulf of Lhûn]] and the havens of [[Forlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]], and [[Mithlond]] were founded in {{SA|1}}. Gil-galad was the last heir of the kings of the Noldor in [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]], and acknowledged as High King of the Elves of the West. Many Elves, both the [[Sindar]] and the [[Noldor]], joined him. But soon, there was again unrest among the Noldor, and many of them left Lindon. Led by [[Celebrimbor]], grandson of [[Fëanor]], they founded the realm of [[Eregion]], probably also stirred up by the finding of ''[[mithril]]'' in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], in c. {{SA|750|n}}. Also, some of the Sindar and many of the [[Nandor]] did not wish to live alongside the Noldor, who had done them a [[Second Kinslaying|great evil]], and migrated eastwards to [[Lothlórien]] or [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref name=Rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref><ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}, pp. 1082-4</ref>

When Prince [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] of [[Númenor]] came to [[Middle-earth]], they established friendship with the [[Elves]]. In {{SA|882}} Gil-galad gave him [[Gil-galad's letter|a letter for his father]], the [[King of Númenor]], [[Tar-Meneldur]]. He warned him that a new shadow had arisen in the [[East]] and besought him for aid.<ref name=Aldarion>{{UT|Wife}}, pp. 218-20</ref>
[[File:Irsanna - Gil-galad.jpg|250px|thumb|''Gil-galad'' by [[:Category:Images by Irsanna|Irsanna]]]]
Around {{SA|1000}}, [[Sauron]] tried to make contact with the Elves under the name of [[Sauron#Other names|Annatar]], the ""''Lord of Gifts''"", but Gil-galad and Círdan did not trust him and rejected his proposals. However, Sauron was welcomed in Eregion and the [[Rings of Power]] were forged. Around {{SA|1600}}, Sauron forged [[the One Ring]] in secret, and then the Elves of Eregion found out that they were betrayed. Sauron demanded the Rings, and when they refused, in {{SA|1693}} the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began. Celebrimbor had rescued the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves in time, sending [[Vilya]] and [[Narya]] to Gil-galad and [[Círdan]] in Lindon, respectively, while the third ring [[Nenya]] was given to [[Galadriel]].

As Sauron invaded [[Eriador]], Gil-galad sent [[Elrond]] to aid Eregion and also called on Númenor for aid. Elrond was unable to avert Sauron and retreated to [[Imladris]] with some survivors. Eriador was being overrun until a great fleet of the [[Númenóreans]] sent by [[Tar-Minastir]] arrived at Lindon. With united forces, Sauron's army was driven back and defeated in {{SA|1701}}. After this war, the Elves were not further troubled by Sauron for a long time, and Gil-galad appointed Elrond as his vice-regent, passing the ring Vilya to him.<ref name=Rings/><ref name=SA/><ref name=Vilya>{{UT|Concerning}}, 257-61</ref>
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Gil-galad was an Elvenking.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Gil-galad was an Elvenking'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
When [[Ar-Pharazôn]] captured Sauron and took him to Númenor in {{SA|3262}}, the [[Westlands]] at last found peace, and Gil-galad was free to extend his dominion to the north, south, and east beyond the [[Anduin]].

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] in {{SA|3319|n}}, [[Elendil]] and his sons came to Middle-earth and founded the realms of [[Gondor]] in the south and [[Arnor]] in the north. To honour Elendil, Gil-galad built the [[White Towers]], which housed [[Elostirion-stone|one of]] the ''[[Palantíri]]''.

But Sauron also escaped, and Gondor was soon attacked; Elendil's son [[Isildur]] had to flee, and sailed north to his father. Elendil and Gil-galad then formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] against Sauron in {{SA|3431}}.<ref name=Rings/><ref name=SA/> It was said that the hosts of Gil-galad joined Elendil at [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]].<ref name=Knife>{{FR|Knife}}, p. 185</ref>
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Last Alliance.jpg|250px|thumb|''Last Alliance'' by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]
In the following years, the Allies marched to Imladris where they camped for three years. Then they crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] and marched south, where they [[Battle of Dagorlad|defeated]] a great army outside [[Mordor]]. They broke through [[Cirith Gorgor]] and besieged [[Sauron]]'s [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]].<ref name=Rings/><ref name=SA/> Gil-galad fought with his long sword and his spear [[Aeglos (spear)|Aeglos]] that was much feared by the enemy.<ref name=Knife/><ref name=Council>{{FR|Council}}</ref>{{rp|243}}

When the siege had lasted for seven years, it became so pressing that Sauron himself sallied forth. By his power, the siege was broken, and his army advanced to the slopes of [[Orodruin]] in {{SA|3441}}. There he was engaged by Elendil and Gil-galad in a single combat. In the end of the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], Sauron was defeated but both Gil-galad and Elendil were killed in the act.<ref name=Rings/><ref name=SA/> In the [[Scroll of Isildur|Scroll]] he wrote in [[Minas Tirith|Minas Anor]] before riding north, Isildur wrote that Gil-galad was killed by the heat of [[Dark Lord|Enemy's]] fiery hand.<ref name=Council/>{{rp|253}}
[[File:Michael Kaluta - Elrond Recalls the Host of Gilgalad.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Elrond Recalls the Host of Gilgalad'' by [[:Category:Images by Michael Kaluta|Michael Kaluta]]]]
Thus died the last High King of Noldor, and this title was never claimed by any other Noldo of Middle-earth.<ref>{{App|Numenor}}, p. 1034</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Ereinion Gil-galad.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Gil-galad'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, meaning ""Star of Radiance"",<ref name=Finwain/><ref name=Galad/> ""Starlight""<ref name=Knife/> or ""Star of bright light"". The name consists of the elements ''[[gil]]'' (""star"") + ''[[galad]]'' (""radiance"").<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, note 1, p. 65</ref>

According to early version, 'Gil-galad' was in fact his [[Amilessë|mother-name]].<ref name=Parentage>{{PM|Gil-galad}}, pp. 349-51</ref> However, later version explains it was an [[epessë]] given to him because his armour and shield were overlaid with silver and set with a device of white stars, shone from afar like a star in sunlight or moonlight and could be seen by Elvish eyes at a great distance if he stood upon a height; by this name he was chiefly remembered in legend.<ref name=Galad/>

''Gil-galad'' already appears in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' as [[Noldorin]] for ""Starlight"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""GIL""</ref>

==Other names==
As a descendant of kings, the Sindarin [[Father-name|birth name]] of Gil-galad was '''''Ereinion''''' (""Scion of Kings""),<ref name=Galad/><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Gil-galad""</ref> from plural ''[[aran]]'' (""king"") + ''[[-ion]]'' (patronymic suffix).<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''ar(a)''</ref>

According to early version, Gil-galad's [[Quenya]] father-name was '''''Artanáro''''', or in Sindarin '''''Rodnor'''''.<ref name=Parentage/> [[Paul Strack]] explains it can be translated as ""Noble Fire"".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1045550461.html|articlename=Q. ''Artanáro'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=5 November 2020}}</ref>

An unclear name is '''''Finellach''''', which was included in [[Gil-galad's letter]] to [[Tar-Meneldur]] (but omitted by [[Christopher Tolkien]]).<ref name=Aldarion/><ref name=Parentage/> [[David Salo]] explains it can mean ""Flame of Hair and Eye"".<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 349</ref> Alternatively, it can mean something like ""Flame-eyed Fin(wë)"".

Another isolated name was '''''Finwain''''',<ref name=Finwain/> clearly Sindarin, a combination of ''fin'' (Sindarin for ''[[Finwë]]'') + ''[[gwain|(g)wain]]'' (""young"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2061796837.html|articlename=Q.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
===Earlier versions===
Gil-galad appears for the first time in the second version of ''[[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)|The Fall of Númenor]]'' written c. [[1937]], along with Elendil (in the previous conception, Elrond is the leader of the Elves who remained behind). Both characters create a great league of Elves and Men and fight [[Thû]] in Mordor, but both are slain by him. In that text he is mentioned as a descendant of [[Fëanor]] and an Elven king of Beleriand.<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}, pp. 28-9 & 31</ref>

In a marginal note of §28 of the conclusion of ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] pencilled the names ''Gilgalad'' and ''Lindon''.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 337</ref> This note was probably used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] to introduce Gil-galad at the end of [[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath|chapter 24]] of the published version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', beside Círdan, Celeborn, and Galadriel.<ref>[[Douglas C. Kane]], ''[[Arda Reconstructed: The Creation of the Published Silmarillion]]'', Part II: ''Quenta Silmarillion'' (The History of the Silmarils), Chapter 23 ""Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin"", p. 235</ref>

In the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien still considered Gil-galad to be a descendant of Fëanor.<ref>{{RS|Rivendell}}, pp. 215-7</ref>

Later, through the further writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien reconsidered Gil-galad to be a son of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. In additions of uncertain date made to the [[Later Quenta Silmarillion|later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']] it was told that Felagund sent away both his [[Meril (mother of Gil-galad)|wife]] and son from Nargothrond to the Havens of the Falas for their safety.<ref>{{WJ|Ruin}}, p. 242-3</ref> In the late 1950s, he decided that Felagund was unmarried and childless, since [[Amarië]] the [[Vanyar|Vanya]] whom he loved remained in the [[Aman|West]], and suggested in a marginal note to the ''[[The Grey Annals|Grey Annals]]'' that Gil-galad ''might be'' the son of [[Fingon]] (under the name ''Findor'').<ref>{{GA|157}}, p. 56</ref>

However, in the early 60s, Tolkien returned to an idea of Finrod having a wife<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 7, pp. 317-8: ""''During their dwelling in Nargothrond as refugees ''[Celebrimbor]'' had grown to love Finrod and ''[…]'' his wife.''""</ref> and child, and thus he moved Orodreth down a generation, making him Finrod's son instead of his brother. Apparently recalling the story in the ''Grey Annals'',<ref>{{GA|108-9}}, p. 44</ref> Tolkien spotted the contradiction and moved Orodreth to become in the same generation the son of Finrod’s brother Angrod (who with [[Aegnor]] held the heights of [[Dorthonion]] and was slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach|Battle of Sudden Flame]]), changing his Quenya name from ''Artanáro'' to ''Artaresto''. Finally in [[August]] [[1965]], Tolkien concluded that the best solution to the problem of Gil-galad's parentage was to shift him into the son of Orodreth who escaped in Nargothrond after Angrod was slain and dwelt there with his uncle Finrod, later succeeding him. Orodreth married a Sindarin lady of the [[Northlands|North]], and their children were [[Finduilas]] and Gil-galad.<ref name=Parentage/>

Tolkien's son and literary executor Christopher Tolkien had no doubt that this was his father's last word on the subject, but since nothing of this late and radically altered conception ever touched the existing narratives, he made the editorial decision not to incorporate this revision into the published version of ''The Silmarillion'' and chose instead to present Gil-galad as a son of Fingon; otherwise, all aspects of the move would have required considerable reworking of the story. For a consistency with the published ''Silmarillion'', Christopher also edited a line in ''[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife]]'' that originally referred to Gil-galad as a dynast of the [[House of Finarfin]].<ref name=Aldarion/>
[[File:Karolina Węgrzyn - Scion of Kings son of Fingon (colored).jpg|225px|thumb|''Scion of Kings son of Fingon'' by Karolina Węgrzyn]]
Many years later in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' he regretted about his past decision and stated it was a mistake on his part and did not in fact represent his father's conception of the character, suggesting that it would have been better to have left Gil-galad's parentage '''obscure''' in ''The Silmarillion''.<ref name=Parentage/>

[[Renée Vink]] of the [[Unquendor|Dutch Tolkien Society]] suggests that the only good reason for making Gil-galad son of Fingon is the correspondence of the colours, blue and silver, of Gil-galad's heraldic device and Fingolfin's banner, noting that the publication of ''The Silmarillion'', based on a limited ""grasp of the material"", created a ""virtually unshakeable"" tradition for this parentage. She argues that Orodreth has a better claim to paternity, for several reasons: the crown of the Noldor in exile (in Middle-earth) then comes to a descendant of [[Finarfin]], king of the Noldor in [[Valinor]]; a descendant of Finarfin would fight Sauron to avenge Finarfin's son Finrod; and as a brother to Finduilas, he (alone of the Noldorin Kings) would fight with a spear, the weapon that killed his sister.<ref>{{webcite|author=Renée Vink|articleurl=https://www.academia.edu/13554329|articlename=The Parentage of Gil-galad: A Textual History|website=Academia|accessed=2013}}</ref>

===Date of birth===
In a [[1959]] manuscript on chronology published in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien contemplated various revisions to the years of birth of various characters in the [[legendarium]] in accord with a new conception of how Elves aged over time. In a rough note appended to this manuscript, he suggested that ""Gilgalad"" became King in Lindon ""under"" Galadriel c. S.A. 10-20, and that in order to be of suitable age to rule he must have been born in YT 1481/V.Y. 4981 in Aman.<ref>{{NM|P1xi}}, p. 82</ref> This would be incompatible with the later revision of Gil-galad's genealogy made in August 1965, since his mother is explicitly mentioned to be a Sindarin lady, as described above in the previous section.<ref name=Parentage/>

:In the prologue, Gil-galad is shown as one of the bearers of the [[Three Rings|three Elven rings]]. Later, he is present at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr|Battle]] of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] wielding his spear [[Aeglos (spear)|Aeglos]].

===Television===
'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''
:'''September 1: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':'''
::High King Gil-galad (Portrayed by [[Benjamin Walker]])<ref>{{webcite|author=Amy Ratcliffe|articleurl=https://nerdist.com/article/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-who-is-gil-galad-benjamin-walker-interview-exclusive-images/|articlename=Meet High King Gil-galad From THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RINGS OF POWER|dated=30-June-2022|website=[https://www.nerdist.com Nerdist]|accessed=09-July-2022}}</ref> first appears during a ceremony in [[Lindon]], giving a speech to honor the survivors of [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] company of [[Elves]] who were attacked by a [[Snow-trolls|Snow-troll]] in [[Dúrnost]]. He announces that they are going to go home to the [[Aman|Undying Lands]] for them to dwell for all eternity. However, later on, he revealed to [[Elrond]] that his true purpose in doing this was so that Galadriel did not become the very evil that she sought to destroy.

===Games===
'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)]]'':'''
:Gil-galad appears briefly in the game's first level as a non-playable character, where he has the likeness of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|movie counterpart]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gil-galad appears in several flashbacks depicting the the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than the film version, showing [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad both battling and defeating Sauron at the cost of their lives.

'''2010: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:Gil-galad appears in the prologue holding one of the Elf-rings. He is also an unlockable character, despite never playing into the storyline. He can be found in a cave in south-west [[Gorgoroth]]. His gear is not accurate, however; he wields an Elven sword (instead of Aeglos) and golden shield in the game, though ''The Fall of Gil-Galad'' describes a silver shield.

===Radio===
'''1979: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' by The Mind's Eye'''
:Gil-galad, referred to only as “the elven-king” in the first reference to him, is credited solely with the defeat of Sauron and with cutting the One Ring from the Dark Lord’s hand. Later, he is referenced again at Weathertop in dialogue that more accurately follows the book.

'''Gothmog''' was the [[Lord of Balrogs]] and the High-captain of Angband, one of the foremost captains of the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]] during the [[First Age]].

==History==
He is first mentioned at the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] when his Balrogs surrounded and attacked [[Fëanor]], whom Gothmog himself mortally wounded, before they were forced to depart to Angband when the [[Sons of Fëanor]] came to their father's aid.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> 

He next appeared at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] where he was named high-captain of [[Angband]], signifying his status as one of Morgoth's most important servants.<ref group=""note"">[[Sauron]], Morgoth's chief agent, played a more domestic role compared to Gothmog’s front-line role</ref> There at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad he slew [[Fingon]], thus allowing him to boast of having slain two of the five [[High Kings of the Noldor]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> During this same battle he captured [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] alive by the command of Morgoth, although this order allowed Húrin to slaughter many of Gothmog's troll-guards he was eventually captured, bound and dragged to Angband by Gothmog.<ref>{{CH|2}}</ref>{{rp|59}}

His final appearance was as the marshal of the hosts at the [[Fall of Gondolin]], where he slew, and was slain by, [[Ecthelion of the Fountain|Ecthelion]] in the square of the King.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>   

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gothmog.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Gothmog'' is derived from the roots GOS-/GOTH- (""dread""), and MBAW- (""compel, force, subject, oppress""); found also in the title for Morgoth ''Bauglir'': the tyrant or oppressor.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>{{rp|359, 372}}

==Other names==
In [[Gnomish]], the name Gothmog is given alternative translations of ""Strife-and-hatred""<ref name=""List"">{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 216</ref> and ""Voice of Goth (Morgoth), an Orc-name.""<ref>{{LR|A2}}</ref>

In [[Qenya]] his names were given as '''Kalimbo''',<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 12</ref> '''Kosomot''',<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 93</ref> or '''Kosmoko'''.<ref name=""List"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===''The Book of Lost Tales''===
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Ecthelion and Gothmog (colour).jpg|thumb|''Ecthelion and Gothmog'' by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]
Gothmog already appears in the earliest stage of the [[legendarium]] of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In the character list appended to ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' Gothmog was described as ""a son of Melko and the ogress [[Fluithuin]],""<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>{{rp|216}} but eventually, the idea that the Valar had [[Valarindi|children]] was discarded altogether.

When the armies of Melko attacked [[Gondolin]] and surrounded it, they could not climb the slippery stone of [[Amon Gwareth]]. Then Gothmog led them to the northern gate of the city and piled his iron siege equipment against it until it broke from sheer pressure.<ref name=""III"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|176}} He also took a front-line position against [[Rog]], and with treacherous strategy he cut off the rearguard of the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath]], destroying them completely.<ref name=""III"" />{{rp|179}} Later he beat down [[Tuor]] in single combat in the [[Square of the Palace]], but the elf-lord [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]], who was badly wounded, rose and stood over him. Ecthelion stood no chance against the Lord of Balrogs, and lost his sword in the brief struggle. But then Ecthelion leaped forward, and stabbed Gothmog in the breast with the spike atop his helm. They both fell into the [[Fountain of the King]], where Gothmog, if not already killed by the spike, drowned with his opponent.<ref name=""III"" />{{rp|183–4}}

===Later concepts===
In one of Tolkien's early Middle-earth writings, ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', ""[[Lungorthin]], Lord of Balrogs"" is mentioned.<ref>{{LB|1e}}, p. 98</ref> It is not, however, certain if it was another name for Gothmog, or it simply meant ""a Balrog lord"". According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the latter is more probable, as the name ''Gothmog'' was mentioned in the earliest writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.<ref>{{LB|1e}}, Commentary on Part I of the second version, pp. 102-103</ref>

'''Elrond''' was the [[half-elven]] son of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], the father of [[Arwen]], and the Lord of [[Rivendell]] who consistently fought against [[Sauron]] throughout the Second and Third Ages. He was the twin brother of [[Elros]], who later became the first king of [[Númenor]].<ref name=""Earendil"">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

Having been born in [[Beleriand]] towards the end of the [[First Age]], Elrond ever opposed [[Sauron]] and strove against him throughout the [[Second Age]], helping to bring about Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] as [[Gil-galad]]'s herald. Elrond inherited Gil-galad's Elven ring [[Vilya]], and during the [[Third Age]] he fought against the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and, as a member of the [[White Council]], expelled the Necromancer from [[Dol Guldur]] (who was Sauron in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Age, he was the foster-father to [[Aragorn]] as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aragorn went on to marry Elrond's daughter Arwen. After the destruction of [[the One Ring]], Elrond sailed west with [[Gandalf]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Galadriel]]; their passing marked the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]].

Elrond is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s legendarium, appearing in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He was critical to providing [[Thorin and Company]] with the information they needed to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]], and the [[Council of Elrond]] brought about the creation of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of Sauron.

==History==
===First Age===
Elros and Elrond were born in the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] during the darkest days of the First Age, when the forces of [[Morgoth]] controlled most of [[Beleriand]]. When the twins were just six years old, the [[Sons of Fëanor]], bound by their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], assaulted the Havens in the [[Third Kinslaying]], since they desired the [[Silmaril]] on the [[Nauglamír]] held by Elwing. Eärendil was at sea, and Elwing escaped with the Nauglamír and jumped into the sea.<ref name=""Earendil"" /> [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], the only Sons of Fëanor to survive the assault upon the Havens, took Elros and Elrond as captives<ref name=""Earendil"" /> and abandoned them in a cave with a fall of water over the entrance instead of killing them.<ref name=""L211"">{{L|211}}, answer to Question 4</ref> But Maglor took pity upon Elrond and Elros and rescued them, and a mutual love grew between Maglor and the young twins afterwards.<ref name=""Earendil"" /> Elrond was given the name ""Elf of the cavern"" or ""star-dome"" (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]), because Elrond was found in the cave.<ref name=""L211"" />
[[File:Tuuliky - Little Half-elf.jpg|thumb|left|Maglor raises Elrond. Art by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]

Following the [[War of Wrath]], because of his Half-elven heritage, the [[Valar]] gave Elrond and his brother a choice to be counted among the kindred of Elves or Men. Elrond chose to belong to the [[Firstborn]], while Elros chose to become mortal.<ref name=""Earendil"" /> Elros voyaged over the sea to Númenor following the star of Eärendil;<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> whereas Elrond remained among the Elves and carried on the lineage of King [[Elwë]].<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref> Elrond subsequently remained in [[Lindon]] with [[Gil-galad]], where he became known as a healer and lore-master.

===Second Age===
A fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], emissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance to Lindon during the Second Age. Elrond and Gil-galad sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. They were correct, as proven in the later [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. 
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|''Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In {{SA|1695}}, Gil-galad sent Elrond to aid Eregion. Elrond's forces came too late and proved too small to defend Eregion. While Sauron sent most of his army west to attack Lindon, he left a strong detachment behind to contain Elrond. In [[Second Age 1697|two years]], Eregion [[Sack of Eregion|was laid waste]] and Elrond, along with the surviving Noldor, ran the risk of being overun, when [[Dwarves|Durin's folk]] of [[Khazad-dûm]] attacked Sauron's rear guard, turning Sauron's attention to these new foes. This allows Elrond and the remaining Noldor to flee far north. There, he established the stronghold of [[Rivendell|Imladris]].<ref name=""UTC"">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref><ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

Many more refugees joined Elrond's host as Sauron ravaged Eriador during the course of the war. By {{SA|1700}}, Imladris, despite being [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]], was the only part of [[Eriador]] not under Sauron's control. It was liberated by [[Gil-galad]]'s and [[Tar-Minastir]]'s forces. After Sauron's defeat, a Council was held at that time, establishing that Imladris should be maintained as an Elvish stronghold, and appointing Elrond as Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, passing the Ring [[Vilya]] to him.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

Elrond marched with Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], serving as Gil-galad’s herald. He was present during the [[Battle of Dagorlad|last battle]] of that war, witnessing the deaths of Gil-galad and Elendil. When [[Isildur]] cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand at the conclusion of the battle, he and [[Círdan]] advised Isildur to destroy the Ring, but Isildur refused their counsel. Elrond subsequently returned to Rivendell, which prospered in the coming years with the aid of the Ring of Air, [[Vilya]], that Elrond had received from Gil-galad. 

It has been argued that, following Gil-galad’s death, Elrond had the right to become High King of the Noldor, but he never claimed the title. Indeed, after the Second Age ended, there were very few Noldor left in Middle-earth for there to be a king over.{{fact}}

===Third Age===
Following Isildur's death, Elrond received the shards of [[Narsil]], which he preserved for many years. He began his long tradition of fostering the heirs of Isildur by helping to raise Isildur's son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had been left in Rivendell during the War of the Last Alliance. 

In {{TA|109}}, Elrond married [[Celebrían]], the daughter of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]. Their first children, the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], were born in {{TA|130|n}}, and their daughter [[Arwen]] in {{TA|241|n}}.<ref name=""AppB2"" /> 

During the late reign of [[Arveleg I]], [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by [[Angmar]] into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elvenfolk of Rivendell joined those of Lindon in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name=""North"">{{App|North}}</ref>

Centuries later, when the Northern Kingdom fell, Elrond took the other heirlooms of Arnor (the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]) into his keeping, holding them for the one who would eventually be able to reclaim the throne of [[Arnor]].

Elrond, along with others of the [[Wise]], was joined by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]], who was sent by the Valar from the West. As they decided, Gandalf invaded [[Dol Guldur]]. The Necromancer withdrew and the [[Watchful Peace]] began. In {{TA|2463}}, the Wise formed the [[White Council]] with the Wizard [[Saruman]] as its head.
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
Elrond was later separated from his wife when she was taken by [[Orcs]]. Their sons rescued her, but Elrond was unable to heal her mentally, and she decided to leave for the [[Uttermost West|West]] in {{TA|2510|n}}.

In {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met to decide whether to act on Gandalf's discovery of the identity of the [[Necromancer]] as Sauron, but [[Saruman]] dissuaded the others from acting upon Gandalf's revelation.

In {{TA|2933}}, Elrond took [[Aragorn]] as his foster-son in Rivendell, and had Arwen live in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandmother.

Elrond named Aragorn ''[[Estel]]'' (""Hope"") and concealed his heritage from him until he came of age. When Aragorn became an adult, Elrond gave him the [[Ring of Barahir]] and the shards of Narsil, foreseeing that Aragorn might be the one to claim the thrones of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. When Aragorn fell in love with Arwen, Elrond revealed to him that Arwen shared the choice of the Half-elven, and that one or the other of them would ultimately be parted from her forever. Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both Gondor and Arnor.
[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Elrond and Thrór's Map.jpg|thumb|Elrond examines [[Thrór's Map]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'']]
In {{TA|2941}}, Elrond welcomed [[Thorin and Company]] into his home, the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]] before the wild. On Midsummer's Eve - the night before the [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and [[Gandalf]] continued on their journey eastward - Elrond examined the swords which they had found in the trolls' cave. He read the runes and revealed that [[Thorin|Thorin's]] sword was called [[Orcrist]], the ""Goblin-cleaver"", and that Gandalf's sword was named [[Glamdring]], the ""Foe-hammer"". He told them that they were [[Elves|Elven]] swords from the ancient city of [[Gondolin]], destroyed long ago. He then looked at [[Thrór's Map]] and found that there were [[moon-letters]]. From the moon of that midsummer's eve he could read the words: 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' and 'stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole'. This information proved vital for Bilbo and the Dwarves to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]] through its secret entrance.<ref name=""H3"">{{H|3}}</ref>

During that same year, the [[White Council]] assailed [[Dol Guldur]] and rid [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence.<ref name=""AppB2"">{{App|B2}}</ref> Upon Bilbo and Gandalf's return to Rivendell, Elrond and the grey wizard discussed this and the events of the Lonely Mountain. They both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name=""H19"">{{H|19}}</ref>

The White Council last met in {{TA|2953}}, when Gandalf expressed his concerns that the One Ring was Bilbo's ring found in the [[Goblin-town]]. Saruman quieted him, insisting that the Ring had been swept out to sea.

====War of the Ring====
When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] first left the Shire with the One Ring, it was always his intention to go to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond. Indeed, in his letter left at Bree, Gandalf counselled him to do so. After Elrond healed Frodo of his wound sustained at [[Weathertop]], he then hosted the feast that was held when Frodo recovered.
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel returns to Rivendell.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel returns to Rivendell'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
Elrond presided at the [[Council of Elrond]]. During that meeting, he narrated what he knew of the history of Isildur and the Ring. He identified Aragorn as the [[Heir of Isildur]], and when Frodo ultimately volunteered to carry the Ring, Elrond affirmed that decision. Elrond also appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], despite accepting [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] only reluctantly.

Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir to join the [[Dúnedain]] Rangers who rode to [[Rohan]] to join Aragorn. Through Elrohir, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. During the [[Last Debate]], Elrohir supported Aragorn’s decision to attack Mordor as a diversion to allow Frodo time to reach Mount Doom, saying that this was Elrond’s advice. 

After the passing of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West|King]] of the new [[Reunited Kingdom]] on [[1 May]], and according to his own promise Elrond escorted Arwen to [[Lothlórien]]. They arrived on [[20 May]] and Arwen went to [[Minas Tirith]] to wed Aragorn.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> He parted from her in great sorrow.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''Departure at the Grey Havens'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Elrond was one of the Elves who took the [[White Ship]] to [[Valinor]] along with Frodo, Gandalf, and the other [[Ring-bearers]]. The Third Age's end is marked by their departure.

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|He was as noble and fair as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', ""[[A Short Rest]]""}}
Elrond seemed ageless, resembling neither old nor young. However, one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.

Elrond is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey, shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.<ref name=""meetings"" /><ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>

His parents were [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]]. He was thus [[Half-elven]]: Eärendil was the child of the mortal [[Tuor]] and the elf [[Idril]], while Elwing was the grandchild of [[Beren]] (a [[Man]]) and [[Lúthien]] (daughter of the Elf-king [[Thingol]] and the Maia [[Melian]]). Consequently, Elrond was descended from all three tribes of the Elves ([[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] through Idril, [[Sindar]] through Lúthien), a Maia, and all three houses of the [[Edain]] ([[House of Hador|Hador]], [[House of Haleth|Haleth]] and [[House of Bëor|Bëor]]).

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Elrond.mp3|Ardamir}}
In a letter from 1958, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained that ''Elrond'' is a [[Sindarin]] name that he was given because he was found in a cave, and that the name is a compound of ''eld>ell'', the Sindarin term for the High-Elven exiles, and ''rond'' based on primitive Elvish ''rondo'' meaning ""cavern"".<ref name=""L211"" /> In an essay that was probably written between 1959 and 1960, J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as ""Star-dome"".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 26, second paragraph about Hadhodrond</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Elrond''</ref> The Sindarin elements are ''[[el]]'' (""star"") and ''[[rond]]'' (""a vaulted or arched roof, the heavens"").<ref name=""Elements"">{{S|Elements}}, entries ''êl'' and ''rond''</ref> In an essay on ""The Problem of Ros"" that was written in 1969 or later J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as ""star-dome, noting that it was given by [[Elwing]] in memory of the [[Menelrond]], the Hall of the Throne of Elwë.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref> ''Elrond'' has also been translated as ""Vault of Heaven"".<ref name=""Etym"">{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 384</ref> In a letter from 1972, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the name Elrond means ""The vault of stars"".<ref>{{L|345}}</ref>

His [[Quenya]] name was most likely '''''Elerondo''''',<ref>[[Petri Tikka]], ""[http://www.geocities.com/petristikka/elvish/PE17.html Quenya words in ''Parma Eldalambaron'' 17]""</ref> isolated from the patronymic ''Elerondiel'' (""[[Arwen|Daughter of Elrond]]"").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 56</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name '''Elrond''' first appears in a draft for ''[[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)]]'', written about the same time as ''The Hobbit'' (before [[1937]]). There he is mentioned to be the son of [[Eärendel]], heir of the [[House of Hador]], who because of his mortal blood chose to remain in the [[Great Lands]] and became the leader of the Elves in the remnant of [[Beleriand]]. There he allied with the Faithful [[Amroth]] (a precursor of Elendil) against [[Sûr]] (Sauron).<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}</ref> In a rewrite of the same text, Elrond becomes the first [[King of Númenor]] instead, the builder of the city of Númenos, and is a mortal (which means that the text was likely written before ''The Hobbit'', as he appears alive there). It is Gil-galad who fights Sauron. With the conception of Elros, Tolkien added a later note that considered making Elrond stay with Gil-galad or return to Middle-earth.<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}</ref>

Elrond was then ""borrowed"" or imported into ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Subsequently he, along with [[Gandalf]], became one of the only characters to appear in all three of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

In the chapter ""[[A Short Rest]]"" of ''The Hobbit'', it is said of Elrond that he 
{{blockquote|...was an elf-friend — one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', ""[[A Short Rest]]""}} 
Note that in this description he is not identified as an Elf himself, emphasizing his elf-friend (= Edain) heritage. In the subsequent fleshing out of his background, it is never mentioned that he was ever the ""chief"" of the people who came from ""both elves and heroes of the North"" (which would apply to the [[Half-elven]] or rather the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]).

===Films===
'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:Elrond is given the title 'alvkungen', which translates to 'Elf king'. After [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo’s]] recovery from the [[Morgul-wound]], those present at [[Rivendell]] hold a feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes the next day and Elrond talks of the [[Elves]] battles against [[Sauron]]. Frodo asks how he can remember this, noting that [[Gil-galad]] died over three thousand years ago. Elrond tells Frodo that he has lived in [[Middle-earth]] for Three [[Ages]] and that he was present for the [[Siege of Barad-dûr|defeat of Sauron]] and watched as [[Isildur]] cut [[The One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand and took the Ring for himself. After [[Gandalf]] tells of how he escaped from [[Saruman]], Elrond tells the Council of their chief goal: Bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire in which it was created. Elrond reminds them that destroying the Ring would bring peace for all of Middle-earth and that it is imperative that they put their lives on the line to bring about peace. After the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] are decided and they begin to prepare for their journey, Elrond farewells Gandalf and wishes him luck on their quest. 

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears in [[Rivendell]], crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]], and identifies [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although Tolkien clearly states [[Elves]] do not have beards. His voice was provided by [[Cyril Ritchard]].

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Elrond, voiced by [[André Morell]], appears at the [[Council of Elrond]]. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until [[the One Ring]] is brought forward does he take an active part.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears roughly the same as in the first of [[Rankin/Bass]]' films. The premise of the film, a [[minstrel of Gondor]] who tells the tale of ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom"" at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' 129th birthday party in Rivendell, allows Elrond to be a member of the audience, and then sails west, with [[Gandalf]] and the two allowed Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins]] (his nephew) come because of their service in Middle-earth and being friends. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on ''The Hobbit'', Rankin/Bass regular [[Paul Frees]] took over as his voice.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Elrond, played by [[Hugo Weaving]], first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of [[Gil-galad]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking [[Isildur]] into [[Mount Doom]], trying to persuade him to destroy the Ring. [[Círdan]] is omitted.

:As in the book, Elrond heals [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s wound from [[Weathertop]]. Elrond then has a conversation with [[Gandalf]], discussing the many challenges that face them. Elrond argues that the Ring cannot remain in Rivendell (in the film, Frodo appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Ring there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of [[Men]], and gives the first hints about [[Aragorn]]'s real identity. In the Council of Elrond, Elrond himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Ring. He does not select the Fellowship, but accepts those who volunteer.

:Elrond gains two additional scenes in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aragorn beside the grave of Aragorn’s mother. Elrond encourages the reluctant Aragorn to accept his fate of becoming [[Kings of Gondor|king]]. In the next scene, Elrond blesses the departing [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]].

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Though he had no scenes in the book, Elrond appears mainly in conversations with [[Arwen]], whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aragorn remembers Elrond telling him to abandon his love for Arwen, allowing her to sail to [[Valinor]]. Aragorn attempts to do this, but Arwen denies him. In another scene, Elrond persuades Arwen that she should sail to Valinor, describing what will happen if she remains and Aragorn dies. Elrond then has a [[ósanwe|telepathic]] communication with [[Galadriel]] discussing the [[War of the Ring|war]] that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to [[Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim|Men]] there, since when [[Haldir]] arrives at Helm's Deep he says that he brings ""word from Elrond of Rivendell.""

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:In the final installment of Jackson's film series, Elrond's first scene is with Arwen, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Elrond acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the [[shards of Narsil]] [[Andúril|re-forged]], then carries the new sword to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]]. He finally convinces Aragorn to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Later, Elrond escorts Arwen to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Aragorn]]'s coronation, and he finally sails to Valinor with the [[Ring-bearers]].

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Elrond.<ref name=""IMCasting"">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> As in the book, he identifies Gandalf's and [[Thorin]]'s respective swords, as well as translating the [[Moon-letters|runes]] on Thorin's [[Thrór's Map|map]] in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first]] film. There is an additional scene where Elrond meets with the [[White Council]]. Like [[Saruman]], Elrond is somewhat skeptical of Gandalf's claims, deeming the Quest of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] unwise. However, he is clearly alarmed by Gandalf's revealing of the [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] from [[Dol Guldur]]. Elrond is seen again in the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|third]] of these films where he participates in the [[Attack on Dol Guldur|battle]] of Dol Guldur, joining Saruman and Galadriel in fighting off the [[Nazgûl]].

Elrond is a playable character during the assault on [[Dol Guldur]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Elrond is a non-playable character and can be found in the library of the Last Homely House in Rivendell. During the Elven Prologue set hundreds of years before the War of the Ring he participates in a battle in the refuge of Edhellion, in northern [[Ered Luin]]. Elrond is heavily involved in the game original storyline and the characters are frequently bidden to return to him after uncovering troubling signs of the Enemy or achieving notable victories.

Boromir was beloved by his father and was like him in face and pride, but in little else.

He cared little for lore, save for the tales of old battles.<ref name=""stew"" /> Boromir was a man of great strength and valour.

==History==
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - The Gift 1.jpg|thumb|left|Boromir and baby Faramir, art by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]
Boromir was born in {{TA|2978}}, five years before his brother Faramir.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2978 and entry for the year 2983 of the Third Age</ref> Between the brothers there was great love, and had been since childhood, when Boromir was the helper and protector of Faramir. He was only ten years old when their mother Finduilas died,<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2988 ""Finduilas dies young.""</ref> and after her death their father became more grim and silent than before.<ref name=""stew"" />

Boromir grew to be a valorous warrior, interested in arms, warfare and tales of old battles and would serve as a commander to the military of Gondor.<ref name=""stew"" />

On the evening before Sauron's [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack on Osgiliath]], Faramir repeatedly had a dream. A similar dream came to Boromir once. Both Boromir and Faramir could understand little of these words; therefore, they spoke to their father who was wise in the lore of [[Gondor]]. But even he could only say that [[Rivendell]], which is also known as Imladris, was a dale in the far north where the [[Half-elven]] Lord [[Elrond]] lived.<ref name=""Council"" />{{rp|320–1}}

Another day, when [[Sauron]] [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attacked]] [[Osgiliath]] at the dawn of the [[War of the Ring]], Boromir was a commander. His company drove back the [[Orcs]] and held the last bridge; eventually they destroyed it behind them, to prevent the Orcs from crossing the river.<ref name=""Council"" />

===Journey to Rivendell===
{{quote|In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:<br>
Seek for the Sword that was broken:<br>
In Imladris it dwells;<br>
There shall be counsels taken<br>
Stronger than Morgul-spells.<br>
There shall be shown a token<br>
That Doom is near at hand,<br>
For Isildur's Bane shall waken,<br>
And the Halfling forth shall stand.|Boromir telling [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|his dream]]<ref name=Council/>}}
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Boromir sets out.jpg|thumb|''Boromir sets out'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Regarding the brothers' earlier dream, Faramir was eager to seek Imladris. However, the way was full of doubt and danger, so out of protection for his brother Boromir took the journey upon himself.<ref name=""Council"" />{{rp|321}}

Boromir's journey took 110 days.<ref name=""Council"" />{{rp|320}} He passed through the [[Gap of Rohan]] and travelled north through the lands west of the Misty Mountains. He faced many hardships, for that land had fallen into decay and the [[North-South Road]] no longer existed except for crumbling remains of the old causeways.<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> Near [[Tharbad]] he crossed the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]] using a dangerous ford formed by a ruined bridge and he lost his [[horses|horse]]<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, p. 487</ref>, which returned home to Rohan.<ref name=""Riders"">{{TT|Riders}}</ref> The rest of the way he travelled on foot.   

When he reached [[Rivendell]], he attended the [[Council of Elrond]]. Representatives from races and lands of the [[Westlands]] spoke about the current situations, and Boromir spoke about the [[Council of Gondor]]'s vigilance and the struggle to keep the forces of [[Mordor]] from crossing the [[Anduin]]. However, he said, he had not come seeking military aid but counsel. When he told of the dream that had led him to Rivendell the answers to its riddles were revealed: [[Aragorn]] brought out the [[Shards of Narsil]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] the [[Halflings|Halfling]] held up [[the One Ring]] that was [[Isildur]]'s Bane. There he attempted to persuade the Council to let him take the One Ring to Gondor so that it could be used in the defence of the realm. Elrond explained, however, that the Ring could not be used by anyone other than [[Sauron]]. For even though one might use it for the purpose of doing good, it would twist all deeds and intentions to evil in the end.<ref name=""Council"" />

===Fellowship of the Ring===
It was Boromir's intention to return to [[Minas Tirith]], which is why he joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. When the Company of the Ring reached [[Caradhras]], Boromir advised that each of them should carry a faggot of wood.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 374</ref> This saved the Company from freezing to death when they got caught in a blizzard on Caradhras. The next morning Boromir and Aragorn ploughed their way through the snow and carried the four [[Hobbits]] back down the mountain to safety.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 381</ref>

As the [[Redhorn Pass]] was now blocked, Boromir proposed that they should travel southward on the west side of the [[Misty Mountains]] and then either pass through the Gap of Rohan or cross the [[Isen]] and go through the southern lands of [[Anfalas|Langstrand]] and [[Lebennin]]. But [[Gandalf]] opposed this saying that, because of [[Saruman]]'s treachery those lands were no longer safe. He proposed that the Company should instead go through the mines of [[Moria]], but Boromir said that he would not go that way, not unless the whole company voted against him.<ref name=""Journey"">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

Boromir finally agreed, but upon reaching the [[Doors of Durin]] he was angry that [[Gandalf]] did not know the password and he threw a stone into the Dark Water. This alerted the [[Watcher in the Water]]. When Gandalf stepped into the mines the Watcher attacked Frodo, but all the Company were able to escape into the mines.<ref name=""Journey"" />

Boromir fought valiantly when the Company was attacked in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], and he blocked the western door and hewed at the arm of a [[Cave-trolls|Cave-troll]]. After escaping from the Chamber, the company reached the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] they were again attacked by Orcs, and with them was a [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. Boromir sounded his [[Great Horn]] which prompted the [[Orcs]] to pause, uneasy. But when they heard no answer, nor saw reinforcements, they led a second onslaught. As Gandalf fought with the Balrog, Boromir and Aragorn ran towards him, but just as they reached the crossing Gandalf shattered the bridge and the Balrog fell into the abyss, dragging Gandalf in as well.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

Aragorn then led the Company towards [[Lothlórien]]. Boromir advised against this, saying that the woods had a perilous reputation in Gondor and that few escaped unscathed. Aragorn replied that only those who were evil or brought evil with them had reason to fear Lothlórien. After [[Galadriel]] had spoken to each member of the Company in their thoughts, Boromir was keen to know about the conversation between the Lady and the Ring-bearer, but what he thought that the Lady had offered him he would not tell. When the Company were set to depart from Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each of them a gift. Boromir received a [[Boromir's belt|golden Belt]].<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>
[[File:John Howe - Good Sense Revolts.jpg|thumb|left|''Good Sense Revolts'' by [[John Howe]]]]
As the Company set out down the [[Anduin]], Boromir shared a boat with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. As they travelled down the river, Boromir became increasingly consumed with thoughts of the Ring. He muttered to himself and bit his nails and sometimes paddled closer to Frodo's boat. His behaviour made Merry and Pippin uneasy, and Pippin noticed a strange glint in Boromir's eye as he looked at Frodo. As the Company approached the rapids of [[Sarn Gebir]] it was Boromir who alerted them and they were able to turn back. Boromir then advised the company to leave the river and strike a westward and southward road to Gondor. But Frodo did not intend to go to Gondor, hence the Company continued on their way down the river.<ref>{{FR|River}}</ref>
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Boromir's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|right|''Boromir's Last Stand'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
===Breaking of the Fellowship===
When the Company reached [[Nen Hithoel]], it was time for the Company to decide their next course. When Frodo wandered off into the forest to think, Boromir followed him after a while. He tried to persuade Frodo to bring [[The One Ring|The Ring]] to Minas Tirith. As Boromir spoke, the lure of the Ring grew stronger in him. He envisioned himself as a mighty king who would overthrow Sauron, rescue his people beyond hope, and lead Gondor to victory and glory. When Frodo refused to accompany him to Minas Tirith, Boromir became enraged and stressed and tried to take the Ring from Frodo by force. Frodo put the Ring on and vanished. When [[Frodo]] had gone, Boromir was overwhelmed with the realization of what he had done. He wept and called for Frodo to return, but it was too late.<ref name=""Breaking"">{{FR|Breaking}}</ref>

When Boromir returned to the Company he would only say that he had argued with Frodo and that the hobbit had disappeared. Merry and Pippin ran off looking for their friend, and Aragorn told Boromir to follow them and guard them.<ref name=""Breaking"" /> Boromir did as he was asked. When he found the Hobbits they were surrounded by dozens of Orcs. Boromir slew many of them and the rest fled. He began to lead the Hobbits back to the campsite, but they were attacked again by at least 100 Orcs. Boromir sounded the Great Horn and fought valiantly to prevent the Orcs from seizing Merry and Pippin. He was pierced arrow after arrow, but he refused to die so easily. Many arrows were shot before he fell at last, and the Hobbits were taken prisoner.<ref name=""Departure"">{{TT|Departure}}</ref>
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - The Death of Boromir.jpg|thumb|left|''The Death of Boromir'' by Peter Xavier Price]]
Boromir was still alive when Aragorn found him. At least twenty Orcs lay slain around him. Boromir still held his sword, though the blade had been broken off at the hilt, and the Great Horn had been cloven in two. Before he died, Boromir told Aragorn that he had tried to take the Ring from Frodo. He asked Aragorn to forgive him, that he had fallen to the lure of the Ring, but Aragorn assured him that he was forgiven and that he had redeemed himself before he died. Then Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas laid Boromir's body in one of the boats. His shattered horn and sword they laid across his lap and the weapons of his enemies were laid at his feet. Aragorn and Legolas sang the [[Song of Boromir]] while they set his funeral boat adrift on the Anduin. The river then carried Boromir's body over the [[Rauros|Rauros-falls]].<ref name=""Departure"" />
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The funeral-boat of Boromir.jpg|thumb|''The funeral-boat of Boromir'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Three nights later, Faramir was sitting by the banks of the Anduin in Osgiliath when he saw or envisioned a boat float past him on the river. Faramir had heard the Great Horn sounding in the distance when Boromir was in need, and now he saw his brother's body laid out in the boat, but the Great Horn was missing. The two halves of the horn were later washed ashore and they were returned to Denethor. It was said that the boat bearing Boromir's body was borne down the Anduin and out into the Sea.<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[File:Jean Fouquet-Mort de Roland.jpg|thumb|Roland is found by his brother Baudoin next to his olifant, during the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Roncevaux|Battle of Roncevaux]].]]
Many similarities have been suggested between [[wikipedia:Roland|Roland]], the paladin of Charlemagne, and Boromir: both bore a white horn, were military leaders who defended their lord's realm, shared the flaw of pride and both died tragically away from home in the wilderness while defending their companions against an overwhelming enemy force and blew their horn before their death.<ref>[[Gerard Seaman]], ""Old French Literature"", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pp. 468-9</ref> Like Roland in battle with the Saracens blew his horn to call for Charlemagne, Boromir called for Aragorn. In both cases, help came too late.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 359</ref>

{{Quote|There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father...|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Council of Elrond]]""}}

'''Legolas''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]] of [[Sindar|Sindar]]in origin, the prince of the [[Woodland Realm]] of [[Mirkwood]]. His grandfather [[Oropher]] was of the [[Sindar]] of [[Doriath]], and his father [[Thranduil]] was king of Mirkwood ([[Greenwood the Great]]). His birthdate is unknown, as are his earliest exploits. His most notable role is the part he played in the [[War of the Ring]], during which he represented the [[Elves|Elven]] in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. His Elven abilities, such as superior sight and hearing, lightness of foot, and skilled archery, were invaluable to his eight companions.

Legolas' unlikely friendship with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Gimli]] son of [[Glóin]] was considered odd. As such a friendship was rare between the two races, due to the long-standing grievances between [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] dating back to the [[Elder Days]]. And, unlikely because of the grudge between their two particular houses for the rough treatment Glóin and the rest of [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company was given by Thranduil on an earlier occasion.<ref>{{H|8}}; {{H|9}}</ref> 

==History==
There are nothing to say about Legolas’s birthdate and early upbringing, except for the very few things he himself has said on the matter.

During the [[War of the Ring]], the creature [[Gollum]] was captured by [[Aragorn]], and put under lock and key by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. Through their over-kindliness to him, however, Gollum managed an escape with the help of [[Sauron]]'s [[Orcs]]. Legolas was dispatched to [[Rivendell]] to deliver this ill news to [[Elrond]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref name=""Council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Legolas was present at the [[Council of Elrond]] and related the news of Gollum's escape, quickly adding that it was not through lack of vigilance that he slipped their grasp, and provided a detailed account of the whole affair to the Council.<ref name=""Council"" /> He spoke little if at all after his report, but was later chosen to represent the Elves in the [[Nine Walkers]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to participate in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. His skills would prove invaluable to the Fellowship. 

===Fellowship of the Ring===
For the early part of the quest, the nine companions walked single file, Gandalf leading, Legolas, with his keen eyes, providing the rearguard.  When the Company came to [[Hollin]], Legolas was very deeply moved: the wholesome air yet spoke of the Elves that dwelt there long ago, and his sharp ears heard the very stones crying out for grief at their departure and memory of their ways.<ref name=""South"" />  

[[File:Peter Xavier Price - 'I go to find the Sun!'.jpg|thumb|''I go to find the Sun!'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
As they ascended [[Caradhras]], Legolas in his light shoes could walk on top of the snow, whereas the others were forced to trudge and wade their way forward. But snow or no snow, nothing could dampen his buoyant Elven spirit, and he joked lightly with Gandalf even at the darkest moments. He scouted ahead and behind the company, dancing over the snow with great ease, and brought news that the storm was, as they had been fearing, put out to stop them by some Power greater than they. When this report arrived, Gandalf reluctantly decided to abandon the idea of crossing by the [[Redhorn Gate]]. Legolas stayed near the [[Hobbits]] on the dangerous descent.<ref name=""South"">{{FR|South}}</ref>

At the bottom of the mountain, the company took a vote on attempting passage through [[Moria]]. Legolas was silent until asked for his opinion, and then said simply and seemingly reluctantly, ""I do not wish to go to Moria."" His loyalty and respectful deference to the decisions of the two leaders, Aragorn and Gandalf, extended even to following them through darkness and unknown horror; of all the Company, he was arguably the most loyal to leadership. When the voices of the [[Wargs]] were heard and the attack began, Legolas did perhaps more than anyone save Gandalf, shooting numerous Wargs and even collecting his spent arrows to fire again, retrieving them, like a responsible bowman, after the fight ended.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

The Fellowship reached the West Gate of Moria, and were halted by the doors fast shut. At last gaining entrance, the Company, following Gandalf's staff, began their march through Moria, a pit so profoundly dark that even Legolas' eyes could see nothing. He served his turn, like the others, in lookout duty through the night on the march. When they came to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] and were attacked by the Orcs, Legolas dispatched at least two before following the others out the east door, having to drag Gimli away from [[Balin]]'s tomb. When [[Durin's Bane]] made its frightful appearance, Legolas was the first to spot it when he turned to shoot an arrow towards the Orcs. He recognized it immediately as a [[Balrog]], and it is the only recorded time he was ever truly afraid: a Balrog held far more terror for an Elf than for any other, for only they remembered where the Demons of Fire had come from and whom they had first served.<ref name=""Bridge"">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Crossing Nimrodel.jpg|thumb|''Crossing Nimrodel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
After the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn led the Fellowship eastwards to the borders of the forest of Lórien. Legolas was seized with a deep excitement, for none of his kindred had been into the wood for many years, and he himself had only heard of it from tales. He was grieved, though, that it was winter, and the full glory of the ''[[Mellyrn]]'' was departed. The Fellowship splashed across the [[Nimrodel]] river, feeling their weariness drained away by its cool waters. As they rested on the shore, Legolas told the tales of [[Lothlórien]] still remembered by the Mirkwood Elves and sang to them part of the [[Lay of Nimrodel]]. At last, the Company turned aside from the path in order to shelter in the trees for the night, not caring to be caught on the ground by the Orcs pursuing them from Moria. Upon being surprised and questioned by the Elves of Lórien who were watching from a tree, Legolas responded cautiously in their own tongue. When [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] queried as to what they were saying, Legolas slyly responded, ""They say that you breathe so loud they could shoot you in the dark."" He hastened to add that they need not fear the Elves.

Legolas was called up to meet with the [[Galadhrim]], bringing Frodo, though Sam followed, as always. The Galadhrim had heard Legolas' singing and knew him for one of their northern kindred. They had had tidings from the sons of Elrond as to the Quest upon which the Company was embarked, and readily accepted all of the fellowship save Gimli, who was only grudgingly allowed, for the suspicion of the Elves of Lórien towards the Dwarves was especially acute. Legolas was forced to answer for the company, with the reminder to keep an eye on ""that dwarf"". The next morning, when the Elves took the company across the river [[Celebrant]] on their way to [[Caras Galadhon]], they told Gimli he would have to be blindfolded, but he was outraged and refused. When Aragorn offered for all of the Company to wear blindfolds, Gimli said if only Legolas would wear one, he would. Legolas was outraged in turn, but Aragorn settled the dispute by asking to blindfold the whole of the Company. In the end, Legolas had no choice but to agree.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>

[[Image:Michael Kaluta - Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel'' by [[Michael Kaluta]]]]
In Lothlórien, many Elves sang of Gandalf, and their language was such that only Legolas could understand. Legolas would not translate the lamentations for the rest of the Company, saying that he had neither the skill nor the heart. During their time in Lórien, however, with the influence of the Lady [[Galadriel]] permeating the air, he became fast friends with Gimli, a friendship that would never be broken.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> He was one of the Company that could handle boats, and when the Fellowship prepared to leave Lórien, he was assigned to paddle one with Gimli. From the lady Galadriel, he received an Elven cloak and brooch, like the others, and a long, stout bow and quiver of arrows, such as the Galadhrim used.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

When the Company was ambushed by orc-archers on the [[Anduin]], Legolas quickly leaped out onto dry ground and up the riverbank with his bow, searching in the darkness for any sign of the Orcs. From Frodo's low position in the boats, he appeared to be crowned with white stars as he stood tall upon the bank. Suddenly, the south wind chased the clouds away, and a chilling dread fell on the Company. Legolas looked up, and sighed, ""[[Elbereth Gilthoniel]]!"" as if to draw strength to face the terror riding high in the wind. As the Shadow approached, he bent the great bow of Lórien and shot the descending [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]] from the sky, one of his most masterful deeds. He was praised by the rest of the Company for this, especially Gimli.<ref>{{FR|River}}</ref>

===Three Hunters===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Awaiting the Riders of Rohan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Awaiting the Riders of Rohan'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
When the company was ambushed on [[Amon Hen]], Legolas shot many Orcs until his arrows ran out, and then used his knife.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> Upon the [[breaking of the Fellowship]], when he learned that Boromir had fallen, he sang a lament with Aragorn, taking the part of the South Wind, which came from the Sea.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref> Legolas was of great aid to Aragorn in the days following, as he helped to track the [[Uruk-hai]] across [[Rohan]]. His eyes could see many leagues, and for a while he could see their quarry far ahead of them.<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>

When accosted by the [[Riders of Rohan]] led by [[Éomer]], Legolas stood by his friend Gimli when confronted by the haughty Marchwarden, threatening him with death if he attempted to harm the dwarf. When Éomer lent them horses to speed them on their way, Legolas was given [[Arod]], a very high-spirited horse. But Legolas had the Elvish way with beasts, and after he had leaped lightly upon Arod, the horse was docile beneath him. Legolas let Gimli ride behind him on the way to [[Fangorn Forest]] in their search for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. When they arrived by the smoking pile of Orc ashes, they combed the battlefield for any sign of the Hobbits for several hours, but gave up as night approached. Camping under the eaves of the forest, Legolas noticed how the tree beneath which they sat seemed glad of the fire they lit, stretching out its limbs and leaves to the heat. Though the night was very dark, he was also the first to notice the absence of the horses. Later he asserted to Aragorn that the beasts sounded joyful, confirming Aragorn’s own guess.<ref name=""White"">{{TT|White}}</ref>

Upon entering Fangorn, Legolas declared that he almost felt young again beside those trees. He commented that in earlier days he could have been happy there. Gimli snorted, saying, “''I dare say you could. You are a Wood-elf, anyway, though Elves of any kind are strange folk.''” Legolas would later reverse this declaration at the [[Hornburg]]. When the [[Three Hunters]] met with the apparition of an old man, whom they believed to be [[Saruman]], despite Gimli’s encouragement Legolas did not shoot him. The old man declared, ""''Put away that bow, Master Elf.''"" Legolas dropped his bow, but later picked it up again, and was about to shoot when it was seen that beneath the old man’s robes there was white. Yet he recognised that it was [[Gandalf]] just in time, and shot his arrow high in the air to be consumed by fire. Gandalf coolly added, ""''Well met, I say to you again, Legolas!''""<ref name=""White"" />

===With the Rohirrim===
Legolas was the first to ask Gandalf about Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf’s apparently miraculous escape. After the story, Gandalf delivered [[Galadriel's messages]] to each of them, Legolas' being:

{{blockquote|Legolas Greenleaf long under tree<br />
In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!<br />
If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,<br />
Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.<ref name=White/>}}

Later, Legolas again used his eyes for the help of the company, as he spied both of [[Isengard]] and [[Edoras]] from afar. He played only a passive role in the healing of [[Théoden|Théoden King]], and later was arrayed in shining mail beside Aragorn. Gimli would not ride on Éomer's horse unless Legolas rode beside them, which he did gladly. Éomer declared, ""''Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!''""<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>

[[Image:John Howe - Legolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep.jpg|thumb|right|''Legolas and Gimli at Helm's Deep'' [[John Howe]]]]
As Legolas stood at the [[Hornburg]] at the eve of battle, he said that he did not like the place. Gimli comforted him, and he was glad that the dwarf stood by his side. He also wished that a hundred archers of [[Mirkwood]] were there, noting the small number of bowmen among the [[Rohirrim]]. At the opening of the battle, Legolas shot twenty at least, this figure being taken as precise by Gimli. When Gimli returned to the elf for the second time to declare that he slew twenty-one, Legolas counted his kills as twenty-four. By the time the [[Fire of Orthanc]] blew out a piece of the wall, his quiver was nearly empty. With the last arrow the elf saved Aragorn’s life when he stumbled while pursued. At the end of the battle, Legolas had shot a total of forty-one, though Gimli surpassed his count by one.<ref name=""Road"">{{TT|Road}}</ref>

Legolas showed great interest in the [[Huorns]] on the way to [[Isengard]], discussing them with Gandalf and a less willing Gimli. Legolas promised Gimli that he would go to [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]] after the war upon hearing the dwarf’s eloquence, if only Gimli would accompany him on a return to Fangorn. At Isengard he enjoyed a meal in the company of Gimli, Aragorn, and the [[Hobbits]], Merry and Pippin.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>

===Return of the King===
When Aragorn made clear his purpose as to the taking of the [[Paths of the Dead]], Legolas and Gimli willingly volunteered to go with him. Legolas predicted, when Gimli suggested that Galadriel might have sent them soldiers from their own lands, that they need not ride away to find war.

Amidst the Paths of the Dead, riding with the [[Grey Company]], Legolas alone, save for [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], [[Elrond|Elrond's]] sons, felt no fear of the [[Oathbreakers]],<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> and it may be remembered that the High Elves had power both in the worlds of the seen and unseen. Yet his turn came to be struck to the heart in the opposite sense – when he heard the gulls at [[Pelargir]], fulfilling Galadriel’s prediction and warning. While telling this story later, he stopped there, while Gimli promptly said, ""''For my part I heeded them not''"". Legolas saw as Aragorn led the Dead Men what a mighty lord he might have been if he had taken the [[One Ring]].<ref name=""Debate"">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

Legolas came with Aragorn from the ships during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], and fought there beside his comrades. He survived the battle, and afterward commented on the longevity and eventual domination of [[Men]] to the dubious Gimli.<ref name=""Debate"" />

===Battle of the Morannon and aftermath===
Legolas rode for the last time into battle beside his friends to the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. He witnessed the Fall of the Dark Tower, and after the battle attended the ceremonies of the [[Field of Cormallen]] in honour of Frodo and Samwise and their victory. That night Legolas would not go to bed, but instead went away to walk in the woods, singing of the Sea.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>

At the urging of Aragorn, Legolas remained in [[Minas Tirith]] for a time, after attending the coronation of [[Aragorn|Elessar]]. During the parting of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]], Legolas went with Gimli to [[Aglarond]]. After that, he rode off with Gimli to return to [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

===After the War of the Ring===
[[File:Turner Mohan - Legolas and Gimli depart.jpg|thumb|''Legolas and Gimli depart'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]] 
In the early Fourth Age Legolas brought south [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves out of Greenwood]], and they dwelt in Ithilien, which became once again the fairest country in all the westlands.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref>{{rp|1080}} During his stay in Ithilien, Legolas devised the renowned gardens of Prince Faramir's new home in the Hills of [[Emyn Arnen]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary on ''The Stewards of Gondor'' (""Faramir""), p. 220</ref>

Legolas and the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-Elves]] later worked together with Gimli and the Dwarves to rebuild and improve [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=""Durin"" />{{rp|1080}} After King Elessar died in {{FoA|120}}, Legolas built a grey ship in Ithilien and sailed down the Anduin and onwards into the [[Aman|West]],<ref name=""AppB"">{{App|Later}}, entry '''1541''', p. 1098</ref> reportedly taking Gimli with him.<ref name=""Durin"" />{{rp|1081}}<ref name=""AppB"" />

==Characteristics==
===Appearance and equipment===
[[Christopher Tolkien]] recounts that his father wrote the following ""wrathful"" comment protesting against a ""pretty"" or ""ladylike"" depiction of Legolas: 
{{blockquote|He was tall as a young tree, lithe, immensely strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a Nazgûl, endowed with the tremendous vitality of Elvish bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes over rock or through snow, the most tireless of all the Fellowship.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', p. 327}}

At Rivendell, Legolas was dressed in green and brown garb,<ref name=""Council"" /> and he was probably dressed similarly for the duration of the quest.
He bore a bow from Mirkwood, and later a [[Bow of the Galadhrim]]. He also had a long white knife.<ref name=""South"" /> He was a master archer, unmatched by any other during his time, capable of shooting adversaries from afar, and on occasion kill more than one with a single arrow, as shown when he nailed two orcs through the throat in Moria.<ref name=""Bridge"" /> His skill with a bow was even more formidable due to his keen eyesight. At the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], he also proved skilled at knife-fighting in close quarters.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>

===Personality===
Legolas showed almost irrepressible cheerfulness throughout the journey, passing through Caradhras and even the Paths of the Dead without hesitation or complaint. His youthful nature can be seen from the mocking way he spoke of the ""strong men"" on Caradhras, who Boromir (meaning himself and Aragorn) had said could forge a way out through the snow.<ref name=""South"" /> He is perhaps most remembered for his friendship with Gimli the Dwarf, and it was during this friendship that we see his faithfulness, and also his love of beauty. Gimli's words moved him when the dwarf spoke of the [[Glittering Caves]].<ref name=""Road"" />

==Etymology==
The name ''Legolas'' is a [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan]] dialect form of pure [[Sindarin]] ''Laegolas'', which means ""Greenleaf"". At one point he is called ""Legolas '''Greenleaf'''"" by Gandalf, coupling his name and its translation like an epithet.<ref group=""note"">''Greenleaf'' is not his surname, as is sometimes erroneously believed; nor is it an epithet (like ''[[Oakenshield]]'').</ref> 

''Legolas'' consists of the [[Sindarin]] words ''laeg'', a very rare, archaic word for ""green"" (cf. ''Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim'', the [[Green Elves]]), which is normally replaced by ''calen'' (cf. ''[[Calenhad]], [[Parth Galen]]'' and ''[[Pinnath Gelin]]''); and ''golas'', a collection of leaves, foliage (being a prefixed collective form of ''[[lass|las(s)]]'', ""leaf"").<ref>{{L|211}}</ref><ref name=""pe17"">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|84}}

In one note, [[Tolkien]] considered ''Legolas'' to be a non-Sindarin name, instead being [[Ossiriand]]ish in which ''laiquā'' > ''lēgo'' (shortened in trisyllabic names to ''lěgo'').<ref name=""pe17"" />{{rp|153}}

The [[Quenya]] cognate of ''Laegolas'' was '''''Laicolasse'''''.<ref name=""pe17"" />{{rp|56}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name ""''[[Legolas (elf of Gondolin)|Legolas Greenleaf]]''"" appeared first in ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]"" in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', applied to a character who guided some survivors of the sack of the city to safety.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, ''Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin'', p. 217</ref> However, this character had no further development in the [[Legendarium]] and is unrelated to the Legolas of the Fellowship of the Ring.

While writing ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien first considered [[Glorfindel]] to be the Elven character of the Fellowship, however he dropped the idea, and Legolas was created to replace him. Perhaps this is the reason why Legolas is considered the most underdeveloped character of the Fellowship, playing only a minor role in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/53965333513/why-is-legolass-character-so-underdeveloped|articlename=Why is Legolas so underdeveloped?|website=[http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com Ask About Middle-Earth]}}</ref>

:Legolas was portrayed by [[Orlando Bloom]].

:In the ""official movie guide"" for ''The Lord of the Rings'', a birthdate for Legolas is set to 87 of the [[Third Age]]. This would make him 2931 years old at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. This date for Legolas' birth was made up by the movie writers. Curiously, the year 2931 was the year Aragorn was born; the writers may have picked the number at random from the ''Tale of Years'' in the [[Appendix B|Appendices]].

:He is presented as an unstoppable fighter, arguably to the point of stealing the show; he performs show-stopping yet implausible stunts in battle scenes. For example, in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], he slides down a staircase using a shield, shooting arrows all the while, and in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], he takes down an [[Oliphaunts|Oliphaunt]] all by himself. However, in the books, Legolas's exploits in battle are not presented in great detail. Aside from shooting the fell beast, he undertakes no major actions other than to make peace with Gimli, overcoming their longstanding mutual racial animosity — he and Gimli are followers, rather than leaders. The film-makers later stated that the entire scene of Legolas killing the Oliphaunt and its entire crew was filmed during pick-ups (months after original filming) to insert a major action scene showcasing him, because at that point they realized that he simply doesn't get to do much in the third part of the trilogy.

:Legolas bears two long knives, while in the book he bears only one. Another, more trivial change, was the number of Orcs he and Gimli kill at [[Helm's Deep]]: 42 and 43, respectively. It is not clear whether this was an intentional change on the part of the filmmakers, though it seems likely that it was, since the original numbers were so clear in Tolkien's own text.

:Playing Legolas in the trilogy was Orlando Bloom's breakout route to superstardom. His handsome features and Legolas's ""coolness"", so to speak, as depicted in the film, have led to the character becoming an unprecedented fan favourite with both fangirls and fanboys, not to mention other Tolkien fans. Many debaters on the Internet during earlier stages of production were worried that a film portrayal of Legolas might render him as far too effeminate for popular consumption. Later, many felt that Bloom was able to avoid this entirely.

Alarmed by the news, Thranduil orders his Realm to be sealed from the outside world, but when Legolas hears that Tauriel has run after Kili, he leaves to find her.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Legolas appears after the destruction of [[Lake-town]]. With Tauriel he goes to investigate the Orcs' armies in [[Gundabad]] where his mother was killed during an old battle, something about which his father never talks. He returns to the ruins of [[Dale]] where the [[Lake-men]] are regrouping. He participates in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and goes with Tauriel to the [[Ravenhill]] to support [[Thorin]]. In order to save Tauriel from Bolg, he uses a mutilated [[Trolls|Troll]] to demolish an ancient tower and duels with Bolg. Bitter with his father's treatment towards Tauriel, he says that he won't return to Mirkwood; Thranduil advises him to go to [[Eriador|the North]] and find the [[Rangers of the North|Dúnedain]] and a young ranger called ""[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]."" Before parting, Thranduil assures him that his mother loved him more than anything else.

{{Quote|And he descended upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of the Valar, as a mountain that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Ainulindalë]]""}}

'''Morgoth''', also known as '''Melkor''', was the greatest of the [[Ainur]]. He fell from glory when he disrupted the [[Music of the Ainur]] and defied the will of [[Ilúvatar]]. Morgoth corrupted many of the Ainur to his service, fought the [[Valar]], and marred [[Arda]]. His theft of the [[Silmarils]] and [[Wars of Beleriand|wars]] against [[Elves]] and [[Men]] encompassed much of the history of the late [[First Age]]. Eventually, Morgoth was bound in chains by the Valar and thrown into the [[Void]], leaving the permanent damage his evils had done, and his former lieutenant [[Sauron]], to trouble the world.

One day, according to a prophecy, Morgoth will rise again in great wrath, but he will be destroyed in the [[Final Battle|Dagor Dagorath]].

== History ==
The most powerful of the [[Ainur]] that [[Ilúvatar]] created was a spirit known as Melkor. Because he wandered through the [[Void]] in an attempt to find and use the [[Flame Imperishable]], the source of [[Ilúvatar]]'s creative activity, Melkor developed ideas unlike those of the other Ainur. His feelings grew rebellious against his creator, for he wished to create sentient beings to inhabit the Void and was dissatisfied by the fact that Ilúvatar had not done so. However, Melkor could not find the Flame, for it was not in the Void, but with Ilúvatar.

=== Music of the Ainur ===
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Melkor Weaves Opposing Music.jpg|thumb|left|''Melkor weaves opposing Music'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When the Ainur [[Music of the Ainur|made music]], Melkor wove his strange thoughts into his song. His song clashed against the Theme of Ilúvatar, disturbing the Ainur around him and causing some of them to attune their music to his. For a while the Theme of Ilúvatar and the discords of Melkor warred against one another. But [[Eru]] smiled, and sent forth a new theme. Most of the Ainur joined with it, but Melkor rebelliously opposed it even more violently. At last, many of the Ainur stopped singing in dismay, and Melkor's discords gained dominance. Eru sent out a third Theme against Melkor, sweeter and more beautiful than the others, and unquenchable. But though Melkor could not defeat it, still he opposed it. At last, Eru halted the music completely with a single chord.

Eru then publicly rebuked Melkor, saying that all music finds its source in himself, and thus Melkor could not create his own song or truly alter the Themes of Ilúvatar. Thus, though Melkor opposed Eru to his last breath, he only furthered the cause of Ilúvatar in new and wondrous ways. Melkor was shamed and angered by this judgement, but hid his feelings. When Eru showed the Ainur the product of their music, [[Eä]], Melkor was one of those who begged to enter [[Arda]], pretending to be willing to cultivate it and guide it for Ilúvatar's glory. He actually wished to dominate Arda and its creatures, especially the [[Children of Ilúvatar]].

Nonetheless, he was allowed to enter Eä and come to Arda with the other [[Valar]]. Once there, Melkor declared to his colleagues that he was the master of Arda henceforth. [[Manwë]], his brother, did not understand his evil, but fearing that Melkor might try and disrupt their labours in Arda, called forth many more Ainur to protect them. Among these was [[Varda]], whom Melkor both feared and hated. Melkor departed to the remote regions of Eä, leaving the world in peace for a while.

=== Wars of the Valar ===
[[File:Jerrel Salvatierra - The Enemy.jpg|thumb|''The Enemy'' by [[:Category:Images by Jerrel Salvatierra|Salvatierra]]]]
But Melkor took form more majestic than any of the Valar, great and terrible and burning with his malice, and he came to Arda to destroy the Valar's work in preparing it. There was war, the [[First War with Melkor]], in which mountains were felled and brutality inflicted on the Valar. Though he disrupted their work and destroyed much, a great spirit named [[Tulkas]] came to Arda from other regions of Eä to combat him. After Tulkas drove Melkor away, the Valar managed to complete Arda, and the world was established.

The Valar dwelt in a land called [[Almaren]], and raised up [[two lamps]] to light the young earth: [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]]. Melkor, meanwhile, had attracted the attention—and in a few cases, admiration—of the [[Maiar]], the lesser spirits of [[Arda]]. Melkor had many spies among them, and from them learned all that the Valar did, and bided his time. As the Valar sat down to a feast at the completion of their labours, Melkor gathered together those loyal to him, and looking down on the beautiful Arda, was filled with hatred. Tulkas was wedded to [[Nessa]] at that feast, and she danced before the Valar. Tulkas fell asleep, and that is when Melkor struck.

Melkor with his host passed over the [[Walls of the Night]] and returned to Arda once more. Without the watchfulness of Tulkas, the Valar were unaware of his coming, and he began to delve in the depths of the earth, making a fortress called [[Utumno]] northwards beneath the mountains in the dimness of Illuin. The [[Spring of Arda]] became blighted as the cold evil flowed out of the fortress. Death and illness took the green things of Arda, and animals fought and killed one another, while flies brooded in massive numbers. The Valar knew then that Melkor was at work, and sought his hiding place.

But Melkor struck the first blow. He came to them in fire and war, destroying [[Almaren]] and the Two Lamps, and caused the world to be filled with flowing fire and surging water. The symmetry of Arda was broken. And in the darkness and confusion Melkor escaped, returning to Utumno. All combined, the Valar were a match for Melkor, but they needed their strength to keep the world from collapsing into ruin and could not pursue him, nor did they know exactly where he had fled to. The Spring of Arda had ended in turmoil.

=== Dominance of Middle-earth ===
With Almaren destroyed, the Valar departed to a new continent across the [[Belegaer|sea]], [[Aman]], and built [[Valinor]]. They also established new sources of light, the [[Two Trees]], to light the world. Melkor, meanwhile, wandered across the face of [[Middle-earth]], in various guises, but armed with cold and fire. Some of the Valar were unwilling to forsake Middle-earth, however; [[Ulmo]] and [[Yavanna]], particularly. Also [[Oromë]] would ride in Middle-earth, killing the terrors of Melkor, who began to fear that the Valar might rise up against him in wrath.

Melkor brooded in the north and built his strength, gathering his demons about him, breeding great monsters, attended by his Maiar-servants later known as [[Balrogs]]. He also created another fortress and armory called [[Angband]], in the north-west of Middle Earth, to resist any Valarin attacks. He placed his greatest servant, [[Sauron]], in control of that stronghold. The Valar acted against Melkor in force, but they were routed, his might too great for them to overcome.

After his victory, Melkor began to delve more great fortresses and pits where he massed his hordes and wicked armies, confident in his domination of the world. Melkor, by wandering about in the dominion he now wrested, also learned of the awakening of the first of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], the [[Elves]]. He instilled fear in them, and slew or captured many of them. Some of those he captured, it is believed, may have been transformed into [[Orcs]] by torture and breeding.

=== Time in Valinor ===
[[File:Jacek Kopalski - The Captivity of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|left|''The Captivity of Morgoth'' by [[:Category:Images by Jacek Kopalski|Jacek Kopalski]]]]

The Valar were not long, however, in discovering the Elves. Fearing that they would be destroyed or corrupted by Melkor, Manwë decided that Ilúvatar wished them to recover Middle-earth at all costs. Bitter from their previous defeat, they arrived in Middle-earth with their full might. They began the [[Battle of the Powers]], and eventually destroyed Utumno after a great battle during which the face of Middle-earth was transformed, though their losses were devastating in the process. Melkor was [[Captivity of Melkor|captured]] and chained with the chain [[Angainor]], but Sauron escaped. Melkor was imprisoned in the [[Halls of Mandos|Halls of]] [[Mandos]], and remained there for three ages, plotting revenge. Still recovering from the grievous siege, the Valar could not pursue and destroy all of Melkor's forces that scattered from the icy fortress, and many foul creatures and minions escaped, left to brood amongst themselves until their master's return.

At the end of his time, Melkor was presented to his brother Manwë. Melkor, swallowing his pride with thoughts of vengeance, prostrated himself before the throne of Manwë, begging for pardon. Manwë granted him thus, though [[Ulmo]] and [[Tulkas]] were displeased with this judgement. Yet the Valar would not let him leave their sight, and he stayed in [[Valmar]]. Before long, he began to exert his corrupting influence on the Elves, especially the [[Noldor]]. For the [[Vanyar]] did not trust him, and the [[Teleri]] he thought too weak for his designs, but the Noldor were curious, and eager to learn what he could teach them.

=== Revenge against the Valar ===
[[File:Lída Holubová - Laurelin and Telperion.jpg|thumb|''Laurelin and Telperion'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]
{{Main|Darkening of Valinor}}
In time Melkor found his greatest adversary and yet greatest tool in the form of [[Fëanor]], the eldest son of [[Finwë]], [[High King of the Noldor]]. Fëanor was the creator of the [[Silmarils]], which Melkor lusted after. As Melkor subtly spread lies and half-truths about the Valar and the Coming of [[Men]] in the form of rumours, Fëanor was greatly influenced, though he hated Melkor himself and had no idea that he was their source. His new ideas of wide lands and realms to rule touched the heart of Fëanor, and the hearts of many other Noldor. They began to murmur against the Valar, and the peace of Valinor was disturbed. Fëanor soon stirred up trouble, and while on trial before the Valar it was revealed that Melkor was at the bottom of the murmurings and troubles. Tulkas left straight-away to deal with him, but found Melkor gone. He had escaped.

Melkor was not seen for a while, but then appeared at [[Formenos]] to Fëanor, tempting him with words of friendship, and an offer of vengeance against the Valar whom Fëanor perceived had wronged him. Fëanor wavered, but Melkor pressed his advantage too much. He touched a chord about the Silmarils, and Fëanor, seeing his designs and lust for the jewels, cursed and rejected him. Melkor departed in anger, and went south past the mountain of [[Hyarmentir]], to the shadowed valley of [[Avathar]] where there dwelt [[Ungoliant]], a mysterious dark spirit in spider-form once his servant, but who had disowned him after his failure. After some time he convinced her to dismiss her fears with the offer of rich rewards. He imbued her with power, and she wove a cloak of shadow about them both.<ref name=Powerboost>{{S|9}}</ref>

Then Melkor and Ungoliant attacked while there was a [[high feast]] in [[Valmar]]. Melkor pierced the [[Two Trees]] with his lance, and Ungoliant drank their sap. Then she drank dry the [[Wells of Varda]],<ref>{{S|8}}</ref> and the two fled north to [[Formenos]], leaving the land once more in darkness and confusion. At Formenos Melkor slew [[Finwë]] and ravished the treasury of Fëanor, including the [[Silmarils]]. Then he passed over the icy [[Helcaraxë]], entering once more into [[Middle-earth]]. He had struck swiftly and surely. Fëanor cursed him, naming him Morgoth, and by that name he was known ever after to the Eldar.<ref name=""Powerboost"">{{S|9}}</ref>

=== Return to Beleriand ===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Ungoliant Demands the Silmarils.jpg|thumb|right|''Ungoliant Demands the Silmarils'' by [[Ted Nasmith]] ]]

Once in safety, Ungoliant turned on her partner, demanding the jewels of Fëanor. The spider had grown greatly in size and strength from feasting upon the Trees and from Morgoth's own gifted power, and he, now very weak from his efforts, feared her suddenly. Lacking the strength to fight the monstrous spider in that moment, he reluctantly parted with each of the beautiful gems, and Ungoliant devoured them. But Morgoth refused to give up the Silmarils, and she encased him in webs, torturing him and nearly devouring him. A loud cry of desperation from Morgoth penetrated deep into the walls of Angband and was heeded by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] and the [[balrogs]], and they rescued him from her clutches, driving Ungoliant away with their whips. So Morgoth returned to Angband, where he wrought an [[Iron Crown]] for the three jewels.<ref name=""Powerboost""/>

=== Wars of Beleriand ===
Morgoth rebuilt the fortress there, and learned of the Elves who had remained in Middle-earth. [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] and the [[Sindar]] dwelt in the woodland kingdom of [[Doriath]], while [[Círdan]] and the [[Teleri]] lived at the [[Falas]] and [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]] and the [[Nandor]] camped in [[Ossiriand]]. Morgoth made war on Thingol, surrounding Doriath and cutting Thingol off from Círdan. But Thingol was able to contact Denethor for help, and the Nandor joined with the Sindar to fight the [[Orcs]] between [[Aros]] and [[Gelion]]. Caught between the two armies, the Orcs of Morgoth were utterly defeated in the [[First Battle]]. Fleeing north they were intercepted and further demolished by the [[Naugrim]]. The Orcs attacking Círdan were more successful – pushing the Teleri to the very edge of the sea.

==== Dagor-nuin-Giliath ====
{{Main|Dagor-nuin-Giliath}}
Morgoth was confronted by further challenges when Fëanor landed in Middle-earth. They set up camp at [[Mithrim]], but Morgoth [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|attacked them]] quickly, hoping to dislodge them before they settled in too much and became a threat. But the Elves were just come out of [[Aman]], and they had the light of that country in their eyes. The Orcs dreaded them, and were swept before them like chaff before wind. Fëanor pursued them even nigh to the [[Thangorodrim]] and the gates of [[Angband]], but Morgoth sent out Gothmog and his balrogs. Fëanor was killed, but the balrogs were driven back. The Falas were freed, and though Morgoth had practically lost [[Beleriand]] outside of the [[Ered Engrin]], he was comforted in the fact that Fëanor was dead.

==== Dagor Aglareb ====
Yet [[Fingolfin]] came next, with his sons and the sons of [[Finarfin]]. They marched even to the gates of Angband, and yet could not go farther. As the Elves began to build (or rebuild) their kingdoms in Middle-earth, Morgoth waited sixty years before he struck again. It was the [[Dagor Aglareb]], the ""Glorious Battle"", called such because it was a great victory for the Elves. Fingolfin and [[Maedhros]], eldest son of Fëanor, combined their strength and repelled Morgoth. They then set up the [[Siege of Angband]], which was designed to keep Morgoth holed up in his fortress.

==== Dagor Bragollach and Fingolfin ====
[[Image:John Howe - Fingolfin's Challenge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Fingolfin's Challenge'' by [[John Howe]]]]
{{blockquote|Thus [[Fingolfin|he]] came alone to Angband’s gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]""}}
Morgoth appeared all but defeated to his foes; he remained dormant and hidden until {{FA|455}}. He surged forth suddenly in great wrath, his armies taking the slackened besiegers by surprise. In the winter he cast great rivers of flame over the formerly green [[Ard-galen]] (causing the battle to be known as the [[Dagor Bragollach]]), burning many Elven horsemen alive. His forces beset strongholds on all sides, led by Glaurung and Gothmog, and several Noldor-lords fell in the succeeding combat. Much of Beleriand was overrun and [[Dorthonion]] was taken, as were northern [[Sirion]] and [[Maglor's Gap]].

In a single stroke Morgoth had broken the Siege of Angband, but the victory was not as complete as he would have preferred. [[Ered Wethrin]], [[Himring]] and [[Hithlum]] had held against him, though just barely. King [[Fingolfin]] was dismayed and enraged by the defeat, and went to Angband in anger. With fire in his eyes, Morgoth's Orcs mistook him for a vengeful spirit and fled from him. There he challenged Morgoth to [[Fall of Fingolfin|single combat]]. Despite Morgoth's power, he held a fear of death greater than any other Valar, and was hesitant even against Fingolfin. When Fingolfin declared Morgoth craven, he scoffed the Elf-Lord and did not dare refuse his challenge. He strode out, his footsteps like thunder on the earth. He was clad in black armour with a spiked crown and shield, with [[Grond (Hammer of the Underworld)|Grond]], the Hammer of the Underworld, and he and Fingolfin fought in a ferocious duel. Flames gashed from the earth with each strike of his hammer, but Fingolfin was faster and avoided each powerful, but slow, swing. The Elf-lord gave Morgoth seven wounds, and though Morgoth shouted in anguish, he was too powerful to be slain. Fingolfin grew weary and was struck down by Morgoth's shield. Thrice he staggered to his feet in vain, his crown and shield broken, and thrice Morgoth cast him down, before Fingolfin collapsed over one of the pits left by Grond.

As Morgoth placed his foot on Fingolfin's neck to break it, Fingolfin in one last strike ran his blade through the Dark Lord's foot, and Morgoth's blood filled pools made by his hammer. The enraged Morgoth crushed Fingolfin, though he was left with a permanent limp from the injury. Morgoth wished to rend the corpse and feed it to his wolves, but could not desecrate the fallen King, for [[Thorondor]] flew in, scratching Morgoth's face and escaping with Fingolfin's body.<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

==== Quest for the Silmaril ====
[[File:Pete Amachree - Luthien in the court of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|300px|''Luthien in the court of Morgoth'' by [[:Category:Images by Pete Amachree|Pete Amachree]]]]
For some time after that the world lay in watchful discomfort. The southern part of [[Beleriand]] was, for the most part, free from Morgoth's direct wrath. There arose two in [[Doriath]], [[Beren]] of [[House of Bëor|Bëor's House]] and [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]], Thingol's daughter. These two lovers embarked on the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], in the process removing [[Sauron]] from [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] and entering Angband in disguise. Morgoth plotted some evil against Lúthien when she stood exposed in his presence, but allowed her to dance for him and she lured him to sleep with her song. One of the Silmarils was stolen from his crown, and Morgoth bore only two until the [[War of Wrath]].

==== Nirnaeth Arnoediad ====
Some time after, in {{FA|471}}, [[Maedhros]] made a great [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]] with the [[Naugrim]], [[Edain]], and other [[Noldor]]. They marched to challenge Morgoth, clearing Beleriand of his scattered forces. But Morgoth through his spies anticipated their actions, and met them with his allies the [[Easterlings]] in a huge battle in which he prevailed, and many princes and rulers of Men, Elves, and Dwarves fell. Thus the battle was named ''[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]'', ""Battle of Unnumbered Tears"". Morgoth's victory was almost complete, as he razed [[Hithlum]], the [[Falas]], the [[March of Maedhros]], as well as [[Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495|n}}. But [[Turgon]], King of [[Gondolin]], escaped by the valiant actions of the [[House of Hador]], the last of the [[Edain]] in the north. The survivors had all gone down to the [[Isle of Balar]] and the [[Mouths of Sirion]].

==== Curse upon Húrin ====
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Morgoth Punishes Húrin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Morgoth Punishes Húrin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Morgoth took [[Húrin]], who had been captured during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and set him in the high places of Thangorodrim, to watch his family, whom Morgoth cursed. Upon the death of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] and [[Nienor]], Húrin's children, Morgoth released Húrin to further his cause.

==== Fall of Gondolin ====
Some time later, by the aid of [[Maeglin]], a traitor-elf, Morgoth discovered and laid siege to [[Gondolin]]. King [[Turgon]], the last male heir of Fingolfin's house, was killed during the siege. Morgoth's victory in the north was now complete, though he had lost [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] his captain and marshall of his armies. Also, a small remnant including [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]] escaped the destruction of the city, bearing their son [[Eärendil]].

==== War of Wrath ====
This was to be Morgoth's doom, for some years later, Eärendil sailed to [[Valinor]] seeking the pardon of the [[Valar]]. This he earned, and the Valar advanced across [[Belegaer]] with a mighty host. Morgoth loosed all his demons and defences against them, but could not stop their might. His dragons fell to the [[Eagles]], and [[Ancalagon]] was brought down by Eärendil himself from his ship, [[Vingilot]]. Morgoth was seized in his fortress Angband, his feet ""hewn from under him, and he was hurled upon his face"", the Silmarils were removed from his crown, and he was bound once more with the chain called Angainor.<ref name=Earendil>{{S|24}}</ref> This time, however, he was ejected from Arda and thrust into the [[Void|Timeless Void]],<ref name=Earendil/> and thus was put outside Time and Space, outside [[Eä]] altogether.<ref name=""Void"">{{MR|P5VII}}, p. 403</ref>

== Legacy ==
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Numenor.jpg|thumb|''Númenor'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]
Morgoth remains in the Void, watched by [[Eärendil]] and unable to return to Arda as long as the Valar maintain their power over it. However, the lies he put in the hearts of the Children of Ilúvatar still remain and will create their evil results till the end of days.<ref name=Earendil>{{S|24}}</ref> Morgoth's will was suffused into the matter of Arda, so in a sense he is never truly gone. Arda was [[Arda Marred|marred]] by him so deeply that only Eru could fully repair the damage. Those who wished to follow in Morgoth's footsteps, such as Sauron, found that by using his residual influence, they could easily corrupt races they wished to dominate.

About his servant and heir Sauron it is said that ""''in after years he rose like a shadow of Morgoth and a ghost of his malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous path down into the Void''"".<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref> Also, during the last days of [[Númenor]] in the [[Second Age]], Sauron corrupted the King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] and the [[King's Men]] to the worship of Melkor, describing his old master as a god of deliverance while denying the existence of [[the One]]. Thus he began a cult in the [[Temple]] in which the Númenóreans made sacrifices to Melkor.<ref name=Akallabeth>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> By the [[Third Age]], Sauron's pride overreached itself yet again and ""''he claimed to be Morgoth returned''"".<ref name=""L183"">{{L|183}}</ref>

Nevertheless, according to the [[Second Prophecy of Mandos]], Morgoth will come back and attack Arda. He will fight in the [[Last Battle]] against the Valar and their allies, but will ultimately be slain by [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], the Man he cursed. By finally defeating Morgoth, Túrin will avenge not only himself, but all members of the race of Men.<ref name=""Dagorath"">{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 333</ref>

== Characteristics ==
It was said of Morgoth that ""his might was greatest of all things in this world."" He was the most powerful being in existence, second only to Ilúvatar, and perhaps more powerful than every Vala put together. Fitting to his name, Morgoth eventually took a form great and terrible, and soon was unable to leave it. He received many scars and wounds over the ages: his hands were burned forever when he touched the Silmarils, Fingolfin wounded him seven times during their battle and inflicted a wound to the foot that caused him ever after to limp, and Thorondor scarred Morgoth's face.

When Morgoth first took visible form he was said to be of greater power and majesty than any other Vala, as a colossal mountain wading in the sea with its head above the clouds, his appearance both of splendour and terror. As a physical being Morgoth was described as highly imposing, and was reckoned to a tower compared to the warrior Fingolfin, and the shadow of the shield he wielded was like a stormcloud. Ever since his downfall, Morgoth held a desire for destruction; above all else, however, Morgoth held deep hatred of the mere existence of intelligent or beautiful life. Unlike his servant Sauron, Morgoth's ultimate goal was solely the corruption, not control, of all that he despised. He was nonetheless persuasive, and could sway and corrupt many forms of life to become his willing servants.<ref name=""Ruin"" /><ref>{{MR|P5VII}}, pp. 395-6</ref>

Morgoth wielded [[Grond (Hammer of the Underworld)|Grond]] in battle, a weapon he presumably forged himself in [[Angband]] (unless Sauron or [[Gothmog]] had held it safe after the [[Battle of the Powers]]), and was clad in black armor, with an iron crown. Despite his strength initially, he continually spread his residual influence, corruption, and might thin across Arda after his treachery and suffered several defeats, and his power slowly, though significantly, weakened. He alone of the Valar had a deep fear of death, and even against inferior foes he held a hesitance to ever risk his own life.<ref name=""Ruin""/>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Sindarin - Morgoth.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Morgoth'' (""the Black Foe""<ref name=VT49a>{{VT|49a}}, pp. 24-5</ref> or ""Dark Tyrant""<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref>) was given him by [[Fëanor]].

Tolkien experimented (but apparently never reached a decision) with different [[Quenya]] translations of ''Morgoth'': ''Moringotto''<ref>{{MR|P3I7}}, p. 194</ref>, ''Moriñgotho'', or ''Morikotto''.<ref name=VT49a/>

=== Melkor ===
'''''Melkor''''' is [[Quenya]] for ""He who arises in Might"",<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Melkor""</ref> literally ""Mighty Arising"",<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 115</ref> ""uprising of power"" or ""Mighty One"".<ref name=P4k>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 350</ref> The name is generally used to refer to this [[Valar|Vala]] prior to his theft of the [[Silmarils]]; for after the theft [[Fëanor]] named him ''Morgoth''.

''Melkor'' is a compound of [[Common Eldarin]] ''mbelek-'' (''melek'', ""great, mighty, powerful""; root [[BEL|BEL, MBEL]]) + ''[[óre]]''.<ref name=PE17/>

The older form of ''Melkor'' is said to be ''Melkórë''.<ref name=P4k/>

In earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], the form of the name was '''''Melko'''''.;<ref>{{HM|HM}}</ref> other variations included '''''Belcha''''',<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref> '''''Melegor''''',<ref>{{LB|1a}}</ref> '''''Melekō'''''<ref>{{MR|Star}}</ref>''. At one instance in a late glossary (c. 1959), ''Melko'', meaning ""simply 'the Mighty One'"", is also said to be an alternative form of ''Melkor''.<ref name=P4k/>  '

== Other names ==
'''''Bauglir''''' was a name used of Morgoth by the [[Sindar]] following his return in the late [[First Age]] , meaning ""the Constrainer"".<ref name=Index>{{S|Index}}</ref> It was often combined with the name ''Morgoth'' to become the full title ''Morgoth Bauglir''.
Another of his names was '''''Belegûr''''', meaning ""He who arises in Might"", but this was rather used in the altered form of '''''Belegurth''''', meaning ""Great Death"".<ref name=Index /><ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 358 (note 21)</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
===Morgoth's Ring===
In an essay dated 1955, appearing in a 1959 newspaper article, Tolkien detailed several events regarding Melkor quite differently than what appeared in ''The Silmarillion''. In this essay, Tolkien emphasized the vastness of Melkor's power at the beginning of Arda, placing him as far beyond all of the other Valar combined and capable of singlehandedly besting them at the outset of his rebellion.

{{blockquote|Melkor must be made far more powerful in original nature [...] The greatest power under Eru. Later, he must not be able to be controlled or 'chained' by all the Valar combined. Note that in the early age of Arda he was alone able to drive the Valar out of Middle-earth into retreat.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 339</ref>}}

The intervention of Manwë and the Valar in besieging Utumno was an act of desperation and fear, one which they believed would have had no chance of success, but would merely serve as a distraction for the Quendi to escape his influence. When Manwë and Melkor confronted one another in the fortress's depths, both were surprised; Manwë to see his brother so weakened, and Melkor to see that he was no longer capable of daunting Manwë by his gaze alone. In this version of the [[Battle of the Powers|battle]], Melkor never fights Tulkas,{{Fact}} nor is he overcome by the might of the Valar, rather he deliberately humbles himself before Manwë and asks to be pardoned. 

Though he briefly considers truly repenting, he decides to deceive his brother instead, for it is at this moment that Melkor desires to bring ruin to Valinor itself. His surrender and pleading to the Valar are not out of fear or guilt, but out of a sense of wicked pleasure and mockery of them, as he devised to feign aid to the Valar by claiming to serve them as penance, and in secret would ruin and corrupt their very domain. The Valar are hesitant, but Manwë in both pity and fear of his brother, agrees to his terms.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 340</ref>

The Valar, however, do not fully pardon him in this version of the story, and he remained under the watch of Mandos while in Valinor. Unable to enact his plans unnoticed, and realizing he was now separated from his servants and armies, whom he divested a large portion of power into, he grows doubtful of his plans, wishing that he had instead fought Manwë and the others in fiery rebellion rather than willingly submit to them.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 341</ref>

<center>{{quote|For Fëanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and a bright flame was in him.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]""}}</center>

'''Fëanor''' was the eldest and most beloved son of [[Finwë]] and succeeded him to the [[King of the Noldor|Kingship of the Noldor]]. 

Being the greatest of the [[Noldor]] — and indeed of all Elves — he had the greatest skill of word and hand, was a renowned craftsman, gem-smith, and warrior. His most famous deed was the creation of the [[Silmarils]], whose theft made him lead his people to the [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. As the leader of the rebellion, his passionate hatred of [[Morgoth]] and terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] led directly to the great triumphs and tragedies of the [[First Age]].

==History==
===Life in Tirion===
Born in {{YT|1169}},<ref>{{MR|P2k}}, p. 101, note 1</ref> Fëanor was the eldest son of [[Finwë]], the first [[King of the Noldor]], and his first wife [[Míriel|Míriel Þerindë]]. He had an unusually long gestation period,<ref>{{NM|P1iv}}, p. 36</ref> and drew so much of Míriel's life energy that after he was born she grew weary of living, and departed to [[Lórien in Valinor|Lórien]], where she voluntarily left her corporeal form and died. Following a [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel|judgment]] by the [[Valar]], Finwë was allowed to remarry and, with his second wife [[Indis]], had two more sons, Fëanor's half-brothers [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]],<ref name=""Feanor"">{{S|Feanor}}</ref> and two daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]].<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />
[[File:Ryszard Derdziński - Feanor.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Feanor, deviser of the Tengwar. Art by [[Ryszard Derdziński]]]]
Fëanor's skills began to blossom, and besides being a skilled smith, he was a linguist and [[Lambengolmor|Loremaster]].<ref name=""WJ"">{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 396-8</ref> In {{YT|1250|n}}, he devised the lettering system of [[Tengwar]], improving the work of [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]]. He created the ''[[palantíri]]'',<ref name=""SIndex"">{{S|Index}}, entry ""Fëanor""</ref> and also wrought the [[Fëanorian lamps]] in this time.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, note 2</ref> He then turned his mind to the study of gems.<ref name=""AAsec4"">{{MR|P2j}}</ref>

While still in his youth, Fëanor wedded [[Nerdanel]], daughter of [[Mahtan]], a great craftsman,<ref name=""Feanor"" /> who bore him [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]]: [[Maedhros]], [[Maglor]], [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]], [[Curufin]], [[Amrod]], and [[Amras]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

In {{YT|1400|n}},<ref name=""AAsec4"" /> [[Melkor]], the mightiest of the [[Valar]] and source of evil, deceived the [[Valar]] into thinking that he had repented of his evil ways. Pardoned and residing in [[Valinor]], he undertook to corrupt the [[Noldor]] and succeeded in making them instruments of his malice, particularly Fëanor. But Fëanor greatly mistrusted [[Melkor]], which was part of Melkor's plan.<ref name=""Feanor"" />

Inspired by a shadow of foreknowledge, he pondered how the [[light]] of the [[Two Trees]] might be preserved imperishable.<ref name=""Silmarils"">{{S|Unrest}}</ref> Many thought that this idea came first after seeing the [[Hair of Galadriel]], which was both golden and silver. He admired her hair so much that he requested a tress three times, but [[Galadriel]] refused each time and would not give him even a single strand.<ref>{{UT|6}}, p. 230</ref> Therefore, in {{YT|1449|n}}, Fëanor began, and by {{YT|1450|n}} he had succeeded<ref name=""AAsec4"" /> in the greatest of his achievements: capturing the light of the Two Trees to make the three [[Silmarils]], also called the Great Jewels. He prized the Silmarils above all else, and displayed them in feasts upon his brow. But later he grew increasingly suspicious that the Valar and other Eldar coveted them, until he jealously guarded them from all except his immediate family.<ref name=""Silmarils"" />

===Feud with Fingolfin===
[[Image:Antti Autio - The Threat of Feanor.jpg|thumb|left|''The Threat of Feanor'' by [[Antti Autio]]]]
[[Melkor]] greatly desired the [[Silmarils]] and his hatred for Fëanor grew, but the Valar still did not know of Melkor's true intentions. Melkor played upon Fëanor's temperament and pride to convince him that his own half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was not only planning to usurp his place as heir to [[Finwë]], but also seize the jewels for himself.<ref name=""Silmarils"" /> The Noldor then began forging weapons, which at that point no other [[Eldar]] possessed in [[Valinor]]. Fëanor's hostility grew to the point where, in {{YT|1490|n}},<ref name=""AAsec4"" /> he threatened Fingolfin's life. For this, the Valar exiled him to [[Formenos]]. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the [[Silmarils]], which he stowed in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë withdrew to Formenos as well.<ref name=""Silmarils"" />

The [[Valar]] realized that Melkor was behind Fëanor's actions. They sent [[Tulkas]] to imprison him again, but he could not be found. Melkor was not seen for a long time until, in {{YT|1492|n}},<ref name=""AAsec4"" /> he unexpectedly showed up at [[Formenos]]. Melkor tried again to manipulate Fëanor, but he went too far, and Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils. He shut the door in Melkor's face and, in a rage, Melkor left. When the Valar heard of the incident, they resumed their hunt, but it was apparent that Melkor had fled from Valinor.<ref name=""Silmarils"" />

===Theft of the Silmarils===
In {{YT|1495|n}},<ref name=""AAsec4"" /> the Valar sought to reconcile Fëanor and [[Fingolfin]], and to mend the enmity between the Noldor and Valar, and invited them all to Valimar to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest, which he grudgingly accepted.
[[File:Lída Holubová - Feanor and his sons.jpg|thumb|''Feanor and his sons'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]
Meanwhile, after first feigning to go north, [[Melkor]] had stolen away to [[Avathar]] in the south of [[Aman]] to seek out the evil, spider-like creature [[Ungoliant]]. Even as Fëanor and Fingolfin were reconciled, Ungoliant helped Morgoth destroy the Two Trees, bringing darkness to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

[[Yavanna]] examined the [[Two Trees]] and found them lifeless. The light of the Trees survived only in the [[Silmarils]] and she said that only by their power could she restore the Trees. [[Manwë]] then asked Fëanor to give them up for this purpose, but Fëanor emphatically declared that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will; if the Valar forced him, he said, they would be no better than Melkor. It was after this that messengers came telling of the raid at [[Formenos]].

According to the messengers, Melkor, surrounded by an impenetrable black fog, had come to Fëanor's vault in [[Formenos]]. [[Finwë]] fought and lost against Melkor, and was the first to be slain in Valinor. Melkor ransacked the vault, taking many valuable jewels, including the Silmarils. He and Ungoliant escaped by crossing the [[Helcaraxë]], or Grinding Ice, in the north to [[Beleriand]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

===Kingship===
====Kin-slaying at Alqualondë====
[[File:Angel Falto - Feanor (The Oath).jpg|thumb|left|''Fëanor (The Oath)'' by [[:Category:Images by Angel Falto|Angel Falto]]]]

The Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's treachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor ""''Morgoth''"", or ""Black Enemy"". Following his father's death, Fëanor claimed the [[King of the Noldor|kingship of the Noldor]] and delivered an [[Speech of Fëanor|impassioned speech]], which he unwittingly filled with Morgoth's lies. He rallied the Noldor against the Dark Lord, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He persuaded most of his people that because the Valar could not protect them, the Noldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight the Dark Lord. Fëanor then swore the terrible [[Oath of Fëanor]] which all seven of his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone—whether Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala—who withheld the Silmarils, and invoking even [[Ilúvatar]] as a witness. This Oath led to much conflict and later caused great tragedy among his seven sons.

Seeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman, where the seafaring [[Teleri]] lived, and demanded the use of their ships. When the Teleri refused to give or lend their vessels, Fëanor ordered the Noldor to take the ships by force. The Teleri resisted, and a battle broke out, in which many of the Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows, against the fully armed Noldor. Three times the Teleri were able to push back Fëanor until Fingon, leading the host of Fingolfin his father, joined the battle thus overwhelming the Teleri.

Due to this act, the Valar proclaimed the [[Doom of the Noldor]], in which they prophesied failure for all those who followed the House of Fëanor. Fëanor resolved to go on, and added a further prophetic statement that their deeds would live on in song until the ending of the world. However, those who repented came back with [[Finarfin]], [[Finwë]]'s third son. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as King of the remaining Noldor in [[Valinor]].<ref name=""Flight"" />

====Exile to Middle-earth and death====
[[File:NOLANOS - La Quema de las Naves.jpg|thumb|''La Quema de las Naves'' by [[:Category:Images by NOLANOS|NOLANOS]]]]
As the year {{YT|1496|n}} wore on, Fëanor led the Noldor northward. By {{YT|1497|n}}, the host had reached the [[Helkaraxë]] and halted.<ref>{{MR|P2m}}</ref> There were not enough ships to carry all of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons seized the ships and departed. Upon arriving at [[Losgar]], the outlet of the Firth of Drengist in the land of [[Lammoth]], in the far west of [[Beleriand]], where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, Fëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind.<ref name=""Flight"" /> As [[Arda]] was flat in those days, the remaining Noldor saw the flames and perceived that, if they were to reach Middle-earth, they had no choice but to cross the Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered heavy losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for the [[House of Fëanor]].<ref name=""Flight"" />
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Death of Feanor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Death of Feanor'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
Learning of the Noldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of [[Angband]] and attacked Fëanor's encampment in [[Mithrim]]. This battle was called the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (""Battle-under-Stars""), for the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] had not yet been made. The Noldor managed to win the battle and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came upon the confines of [[Dor Daedeloth]], but was ambushed by a force of [[Balrogs]], with few Elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing his foes, even after receiving several wounds, but was bested by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of Balrogs. 

His sons came upon the Balrogs with a great force of Elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as Fëanor was being carried off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were fatal. He was brought to the slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] where he saw from afar the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]]. He cursed Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that the Elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes. He was the only person to die this way, for no death like his was ever seen or heard.<ref name=""S|Return"">{{S|Return}}</ref>

His sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which would determine many of the events of Middle-earth during the First Age.

Fëanor's spirit remained in the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=""S|Return"">{{S|Return}}</ref> It is said that he will return for [[Dagor Dagorath]], and will finally reclaim his beloved Silmarils and break them so [[Yavanna]] can use their light to restore the Two Trees.<ref name=""Last"">{{WJ|Last}}, p. 247</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Feanor.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Fëanor'' is an unusual combination of [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]: ''[[fëa]]'' (""spirit, soul"") + ''[[naur]]'' (""fire"").<ref name=""Nar"">{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[fëa]]'', ''[[Nár (Quenya)|nár]]''</ref> The name is actually a half [[Sindarized]] version of his Quenya mother-name ''Fëanáro''; the proper [[Sindarin]] form should have been '''''Faenor'''''.<ref name=""Shibboleth"" />

The name has changed since early versions of the [[legendarium]]. In the [[Parma Eldalamberon 11|Gnomish Lexicon]], written around [[1917]], ''Fëanor'' is given as the [[Qenya]] cognate of [[Gnomish]] ''Fionor'' (""Goblet Smith""), but is mentioned with no apparent connection to the later Noldoli character.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ''Fionwë-Úrion''</ref> However, [[Tolkien]] used ''Fëanor'' in the narrative of the [[Lost Tales]] for the character.<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, entry ""Fëanor""</ref> In the [[Noldorin]] phase, ''Fëanor'' is the original name while ''Fëanáro'' is the Qenya cognate.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early legendarium===
The character of Fëanor first appears in the ''[[Book of Lost Tales]]'', in which Fëanor, one of the [[Noldoli]], gathers pearls and other jewels, and stores in them the light of the trees [[Laurelin]] and [[Telperion|Silpion]], creating the three Silmarils: gems that shine with their own light, and surpass all other jewels in beauty.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, pp. 128, 138</ref> When [[Morgoth|Melko]] begins to spread discontent among the Noldoli, Fëanor, along with [[Inwë]] and [[Ellu Melemno]], counsel [[Finwë|Nólemë]] that [[Manwë]] should be informed of Melko's doings. However, Melko also speaks to Manwë, telling him that the Noldoli are stirring against the [[Valar]], and when Nólemë's embassy arrives, Manwë is displeased with both parties, and sends Melko back to [[Mandos]], and orders that the Noldoli leave their home upon [[Kôr]] and dwell elsewhere, lest their discontent spread among the other kindreds. <ref name=""Theft"" />{{rp|140-143}}

The Noldoli relocate to the vale of [[Sirnúmen]] and remain there for a while, until the time of a great [[Samírien|feast]] held in [[Valimar|Valmar]], to which they fare along with the rest of the [[Eldar]]. During the feast, Melko and his accomplices travel to the emptied dwelling of the Noldoli and slay the guards they had left there, including Fëanor's father, [[Bruithwir]]. They plunder the treasury there, taking the most glorious gems, including the Silmarils. After this tragedy, the Noldoli are distraught, and Manwë grants them permission to return to their home at Kôr. However, some, Fëanor among them, choose to remain behind in [[Sirnúmen]]. There Fëanor broods, striving and failing to recreate the Silmarils, and sitting beside his father's tomb, his discontent growing until at last he fares to Kôr, speaking against the Valar and urging the Noldoli to leave Valinor.<ref name=""Theft"">{{LT1|VI}}</ref>{{rp|143-150}} Soon afterwards, following Melko and [[Gwerlum]]'s destruction of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], Fëanor persuades his people to arm themselves, follow him and [[Flight of the Noldor|leave Valinor]].<ref name=""VII"">{{LT1|VII}}</ref>{{rp|162}}

There are key differences in this section of the story from later versions, but there are also similarities. For one, Bruithwir, rather than Finwë Nólemë, is Fëanor's father in ''Lost Tales''. However, the element of a close kinsman of Fëanor's being slain by Melko at their home in exile remains. Fëanor is still the creator of the Silmarils, and, angered at their loss and the loss of his father, still rallies his people to flee Valinor using the same rhetoric as in later versions.<ref>{{LT1|VIn}}, pp. 156-160</ref> 

In the next portion of the tale, Fëanor leads the Noldoli into exile from Valinor. An inserted rider also describes him as initiating the [[First Kinslaying|Kinslaughter]] at [[Alqualondë|Kópas Alqalunten]] in a bid to steal the ships of the [[Solosimpi]]. The Noldoli suffered much loss at the crossing of the [[Helkaraksë]], and many blamed Fëanor bitterly for their plight. However, they at last succeeded in crossing into Middle-earth.<ref name=""VII"" /> Fëanor's sons are first mentioned later in the tale, as having hidden a store of crystals in Sirnúmen, which were later used by Aulë in the making of the [[Ship of the Moon]] after the departure of the Noldoli.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 192</ref> 

According to earlier outlines of ''The Book of Lost Tales'', the Noldoli spread out in the land of Hisilómë. Different outlines from around this time have different fates of Fëanor. In one, he is lost at the [[Lake Mithrim|Waters of Asgon]], sailing out to the [[Islanded Rock]] there in search of his jewels. In another, it is Nólemë that dies at [[Asgon]], and Fëanor, rather than his son (as in later versions, and the other outline), leads a host against Melko, and is captured and tormented. In later outlines, the Noldoli also reach [[Hisilómë]], and Fëanor drowns in the Waters of Mithrim. In this version, Maidros, son of Fëanor, is the one to lead a host against Melko and be captured.<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref> While Fëanor's manner of death here is different from that in the published Silmarillion, it mirrors it in that he dies soon after leading the Noldoli out of [[Middle-earth]], and is survived by his sons and his people.

====Story of Wéland/Fëanor====
There exists a compilation of texts called the ''[[Early Runic Documents]]'', contemporary with ''The Book of Lost Tales'', one of which identifies Fëanor with the legendary Germanic smith called [[wikipedia:Wayland the Smith|Wayland]]. That story is placed during the wars of the Elves with [[Melko]].

In that text, Fëanor was captured by a man called [[Niðad]],<ref group=""note"">In the text as originally written, ''Niðad'' was a replacement for ''Melko'', and the ''Niaroth'' for ''Orcs''.</ref> King of the [[Niaroth]]. However, Fëanor killed Niðad's sons<ref group=""note"">In the original text, Fëanor killed Melko's ""captain of orcs"", instead of Niðad's sons.</ref> and managed to escape by crafting artificial wings for himself; he also made love to the king's daughter [[Beaduhilde]] and fled with her, but ultimately lost her in the woods.

Eventually Beaduhilde (who was now pregnant) forgave Fëanor, and in spite of her father's wrath at her pregnancy, she still managed to obtain Niðad's blessing upon her son.<ref>{{PE|15}}, ""[[Early Runic Documents]]"", ''ER1f: Sixth and seventh pages'', p. 97</ref> For more information, see [[Fëanor#Inspiration|Inspiration]].

'''Finduilas''' ({{TA|2950}} - {{TA|2988|n}})<ref name=""Dol"">{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref> was the daughter of [[Adrahil]] the [[Prince of Dol Amroth]]. She was the sister of [[Ivriniel]] and Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name=""Dol""/> She became the wife of [[Denethor|Denethor II]] and the mother of [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]]. 

Named after [[Finduilas]], an [[Elves|Elf]]-maiden of the [[First Age]], she was of great beauty and gentle heart.<ref name=""A"">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>
{{Pronounce|Finduilas.mp3|Ardamir}}

==History==
In {{TA|2976}} she was wed to the much older [[Denethor]], son of [[Ecthelion II]] the [[Steward of Gondor]].<ref name=""B"">{{App|TA}}</ref>

In {{TA|2978}} she gave birth to [[Boromir]],<ref name=""B""/> most loved by his father. In {{TA|2983|n}} she gave birth to her second son, [[Faramir]],<ref name=""B""/> and afterwards grew weak. Faramir was ignored by his father, and she did her best to raise him on her own.

In {{TA|2984}} Ecthelion died, and Denethor became Steward of Gondor.<ref name=""B""/> Nevertheless the health of the Lady Finduilas dwindled in the city. The [[shadow]] of [[Mordor]] filled her with horror while she never stopped missing the sea,<ref name=""A""/> and four years later she died at the very young age of thirty-eight (considering her heritage as a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]]). 

==Legacy==
Denethor never remarried, and became more grim and silent than before. It was not long after her death that he would sit long alone in his tower deep in thought, foreseeing that the assault from Mordor would come in his time.<ref name=""A""/> Thus he began using the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' of [[Minas Tirith]], and the despair fed to his mind led to his ultimate insanity and suicide some thirty-one years later.

'''Eärwen''', known as the ""swan-maiden of [[Alqualondë]]"", was the daughter of [[Olwë]], lord of the [[Teleri]].<ref name=Princes/> 

== History ==
In {{YT|1280}},<ref>{{AA|85}}</ref> she married [[Finarfin]], the youngest prince of the [[House of Finwë]].<ref name=Princes/> She became the mother of [[Finrod]], [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]], and [[Galadriel]].<ref group=""note"">[[Orodreth]] appears as one of Eärwen's sons in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] writings, however, he was clearly marked as [[Angrod]]'s son. Cf. more in [[Orodreth#Other versions of the legendarium]].</ref><ref name=Princes/> She was said to be close friends with [[Anairë]], the wife of [[Fingolfin]], her husband's older brother.<ref name=PM>{{PM|XI4}}, p. 344</ref>

Her children, being also in part [[Sea-elves]], had a love of the sea and a longing for distant places; and it was in part due to this inheritance that all four of Eärwen's children chose to return to [[Middle-earth]], [[Exile of the Noldor|exiling]] themselves from [[Valinor]],<ref name=Teleri>{{PM|Case}}, p. 336</ref> although Eärwen herself stayed in [[Aman]].

Because of their [[Teleri]]n blood, Eärwen's children were well received in [[Doriath]], the realm of her father's elder brother, [[Thingol]].<ref name=Index>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Eärwen""</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{pronounce|Quenya - Eärwen.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
''Eärwen'' is clearly [[Quenya]]. As [[Paul Strack]] explains, it probably means ""Sea-maiden"", being a compound of ''[[eär]]'' (""sea"") + ''[[wende|-wen]]'' (""maiden"").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2625531453.html|articlename=Q.

'''Frodo Baggins''' was a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] of the [[Third Age]], the most famous of all Hobbits in the histories for his leading role in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. During this epic quest, he bore [[the One Ring]] to [[Mount Doom]] and there destroyed it, giving him renown like no other [[Hobbits|Halfling]] throughout [[Middle-earth]]. He is also peculiar for being, as a [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], one of the only three Hobbits to be granted passage from Middle-earth to [[Aman]], the [[Undying Lands]].

==History==
===Childhood and youth===
Frodo, child of the respectable [[Drogo Baggins]] and [[Primula Brandybuck]], was born on [[22 September]] of {{TA|2968}}. After his parents died in a boating accident in {{TA|2980|n}}, Frodo went to live in [[Brandy Hall]] with his mother’s relatives, the [[Brandybucks]]. He grew up under the guardianship of the [[Master of Buckland]] [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac ""Goldfather"" Brandybuck]], who was his maternal uncle. Frodo was caught several times stealing [[mushrooms]] from [[Farmer Maggot]], who, on the last incident, thrashed Frodo and set his three dogs to chase Frodo from [[Bamfurlong]] to [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. Frodo was terrified of them afterwards.<ref>{{FR|14}}: ""''though I daresay the beasts knew their business...''""</ref>

Frodo stayed in Buckland until his ""uncle"" [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] adopted him and took him in to live in [[Bag End]], Bilbo's house in [[Hobbiton]]. He enjoyed life with Bilbo, with whom he shared the same birthday - though others often called the old hobbit ""queer."" Bilbo taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the [[elvish]] tongue. Frodo was the only one Bilbo allowed to read [[There and Back Again|his memoirs]]. Bilbo made Frodo his heir, frustrating the attempts of the disagreeable [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Baggins]]es, who coveted the estate of Bag End.<ref name=""party"">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

The two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the [[Water-valley]] and talked about adventure; they were sometimes seen by [[Wandering Companies]] of [[Elves]], though the hobbits did not see them. When they returned home, Bilbo would tell Frodo that the Road is like a massive river, and all porches are its ""springs"" and all paths are its ""tributaries"".<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

Frodo and Bilbo were comfortable and well off until {{TA|3001}}. At this time, Bilbo threw an enormous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|party]] to celebrate his 111th birthday, and Frodo's 33rd, the date of Frodo's coming of age. At this party Bilbo gave his farewell speech, and made his long-planned ""disappearance"" and withdrawal from [[the Shire]]. Frodo, who had been informed beforehand of the ""joke"", as Bilbo called it, was spared the shock that afflicted the other assembled Hobbits. Frodo returned home as the new Master of Bag End, as per [[Bilbo's will]]. He was greeted there by [[Gandalf]], who informed him that, among other things, Frodo had inherited Bilbo's [[One Ring|magic ring]].

===Master of Bag End===
[[File:Eric Faure-Brac - Bag End.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Bag End'' by Eric Faure-Brac]]
Frodo took charge of distributing the presents Bilbo had left for the other hobbits, a long and tiring task. Then [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|wizard]], who had come for the festivities, warned Frodo not to use the magic ring, and to keep it secret and safe. Then he left, Frodo knew not where, with his mind full of curiosity about the ring. A suspicion was growing in the back of the Wizard's mind, but Gandalf did not yet know what it was.

Frodo, meanwhile, was quite well off. He continued honouring Bilbo every year along with his own birthday. He had also inherited some strange customs from Bilbo, like wandering by himself at nights far from home in the hills and woods under the starlight. His closest friends at this time were [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], also [[Folco Boffin]] and [[Fredegar Bolger]], and other cousins from the family of the [[Old Took]]. Like Bilbo, Frodo continued to look robust and energetic even in his forties, and dreamed of one day seeing mountains and wilderness; he often wondered what lay beyond the borders of the Shire, and as he grew older, he would travel further and further from home. His friends were worried, and suspected that he met [[Elves]] and other strangers that had begun to be more common sights in the Shire. These strangers bore strange tales of unrest from lands far-off.<ref name=""shadow"">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

Still, he lived in peace and respectability for seventeen years, until Gandalf returned with the dreadful revelation that the ""magic ring"" was really the [[One Ring]], weapon of [[Sauron]], a thing of evil power thousands of years old. Furthermore, the Dark Lord was now aware of its survival, and would be searching for it, as [[Gollum]] had revealed - under torture - that it was to be found in the Shire. After a long discussion and a test by fire, which revealed the [[Black Speech]] written upon the ring, the two agreed that Frodo would have to leave the Shire for his own safety. [[Samwise Gamgee]], the gardener, was selected to travel with him. Gandalf recommended Rivendell as a destination, as the road was likely safe and the valley well-protected. He told Frodo to take the alias [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] while abroad. Frodo was reluctant, but wisely followed the wizard's advice. He bought a house in [[Crickhollow]] as an excuse to head east.

Gandalf stayed for two months while Frodo worked out the details. At the end of that time the wizard left to ""get some news"", as rather disturbing tidings had come to his ears. He promised to be back for the farewell party. Meanwhile, Frodo was not aware that some of his closest friends were watching him - [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar ""Fatty"" Bolger]], his cousin [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck]], and Sam himself knew that Frodo and Gandalf were in some trouble concerning the Ring, and that Frodo was preparing for some adventure.

As autumn passed, Frodo was waiting for Gandalf, but did not return and Frodo grew quite anxious. Merry and Fatty drove the cart of Frodo's belongings ahead, while Frodo still waited for Gandalf. At the last possible day, he gave up waiting and departed with Pippin and Sam.

===Hobbiton to Crickhollow===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Last Sight of Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|220px|''Last Sight of Hobbiton'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Less than a day into their journey, Frodo, strangely nervous, requested that the threesome hide upon the approach of a [[Nazgûl|horseman]]. The rider was dressed in black, riding upon a black horse, and making queer sniffling noises. Frodo felt the urge to put on the Ring and vanish, but just as he was about to give in, the rider departed at a trot. Samwise then remarked upon the ""[[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]"" that had spoken to his father, [[Gaffer Gamgee]], some time earlier. This made Frodo wish that he had waited for Gandalf.

That night, they were again overtaken by a Black Horseman. This time it seemed to be able to sniff out their hiding place. But as it approached, it was driven away by the song of a group of [[Elves]]. Their leader, [[Gildor]], greeted the hobbits warmly, and lauded Frodo for his knowledge of their tongue. Frodo tried to get information from Gildor on the Black Riders, but the elf would tell him very little. Gildor foresaw that Frodo would have many dealings with the Riders in the future, and urged him to flee them whenever he met them. He and his party left the Hobbits before daybreak, while the three slept.

The next day the threesome agreed to stay off the road. After a brief scare when Sam sighted a Rider, they worried about losing their way. That evening they heard a terrible wail, and Frodo distinguished words in it. Before long they came to [[Bamfurlong]], the property of [[Farmer Maggot]]. Although Pippin knew Maggot, Frodo recalled a scare he had received at a young age after caught stealing the farmer’s mushrooms, being threatened with the dogs. He froze when the dogs came forth from the house, but Maggot's hospitality soon won him over. When Maggot told of a Black Rider who had stopped at his house asking for ""Baggins,"" and made several shrewd guesses, Frodo grew uncomfortable. Maggot took them to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon. There they joined up with Merry. As they were ferried across into [[Buckland]], they caught sight of a dark shape on the landing from which they had come.

===Crickhollow to Bree===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
When they reached the house in Crickhollow, the other hobbits revealed their knowledge of the One Ring and promised to stick with Frodo on the road to [[Rivendell]]. The next morning, leaving Fatty to housesit, they passed into the [[Old Forest]]. In time they were driven by the trees down to the [[Withywindle]], where they were ensnared by [[Old Man Willow]]. Rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], the hobbits came to his house. There they met Tom's wife, [[Goldberry]], and Frodo was moved to poetry over her loveliness. He was interested in Bombadil himself, and several times tried to learn who he was. That night he dreamed of a white-haired figure on a pinnacle of stone, borne away by an eagle.

The next day Frodo tried on the Ring, after finding it had no effect on Bombadil. Not subject to the Ring’s power, Tom nevertheless could see Frodo. That night Frodo dreamed once more, a dream he never forgot.

{{Blockquote|Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[Fog on the Barrow-downs]]""}}

After bidding Tom and Goldberry farewell, the Hobbits went on and traveled through the [[barrow-downs]]. Becoming lost in the mist, they were taken by the [[barrow-wights]], Frodo last of all. Frodo woke in the barrow to find the barrow-wight bending over his three friends. He rose and in a tremendous act of bravery and resilience took a sword and smote off the wight's hand. Then he summoned Bombadil with a [[Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!|song]] Tom had taught him. Bombadil drove the wight away and helped Frodo wake the others. Tom gave the hobbits ponies and escorted them all to the road before turning his face back toward the Withywindle. The hobbits continued along the road to Bree, where they took lodging at [[The Prancing Pony]] inn as Bombadil had recommended, with Frodo registering under the name of [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] as Gandalf had suggested.

===Strider and Weathertop===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Strider in The Prancing Pony.jpg|thumb|200px|''Strider in The Prancing Pony'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
While Merry went out to take a walk in the night air, the other hobbits came down to the common-room and were introduced by the landlord [[Barliman Butterbur]] to the gathering, Frodo under his alias. Frodo asked if Gandalf was present in Bree, only to learn that he had not yet arrived. While Pippin and Sam enjoyed the drink and conversation, Frodo remained withdrawn, soon falling into conversation with a curious [[Rangers of the North|ranger]] called [[Aragorn|Strider]], who gave him a warning about letting his friends talk to much. Pippin began to tell about [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Birthday Party]], and Frodo, at Strider’s encouragement and in an attempt to prevent the name of Baggins from being raised, began to sing ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]''. This proved popular with the gathering, but unfortunately, as Frodo relaxed, he fell from the table and the Ring slipped on his finger, causing him to vanish.

[[File:John Howe - Against the Shadow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Against the Shadow'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Frodo crawled over to Strider's corner and slipped off the Ring, and said that he had rolled quickly to the side. The suspicious Breelanders, however, grew angry or frightened, and eventually all left the common-room. Frodo and his comrades retired to their room, where they found Strider waiting to talk to them. Strider was honest and blunt, telling what he had overheard and what he knew of them, as well as warning them of the Black Riders and traitors in Bree. He urged them to accept his aide by inviting him into the company. Frodo was leaning to believe the ranger when Butterbur broke in, giving Frodo the long-awaited letter from Gandalf, undelivered by Butterbur’s forgetfulness. After some little bit of light was shed on the situation to the innkeeper, he swore to help the hobbits in any way he could, as a friend of Gandalf and one very much afraid of Mordor. Frodo, reading the letter, learned that Gandalf recommended Strider as one to whom Frodo could go for help. After some further debate, Frodo agreed to let Strider lead them to Rivendell.

Strider arranged for a deception, by moving them to a different room. The next morning, their ponies were gone and the room was ravaged. Butterbur paid for a [[Bill the Pony|replacement pony]], and the four hobbits and ranger set out into the Wilds. They passed through [[Chetwood]] and [[Midgewater Marshes]], and finally to the [[Weather Hills]] before coming up to [[Weathertop]]. Black Riders were sighted from the top of the cairn, and Strider counselled to remain where they were. Shortly after the Black Riders came, and Frodo was stricken down. In desperation he put on the Ring and saw the [[Nazgûl]] in their true forms. Frodo then tried to attack in [[Varda|Elbereth]]’s name, but their leader, the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], stabbed Frodo in the shoulder with a [[Morgul-knife]], before being driven away by Strider.

===Weathertop to Rivendell===
Because of a piece of the knife embedded in his shoulder, Frodo started to become ill, so his companions hurried to take him to the [[Rivendell|House of Elrond]]. After journeying for 12 days, they were found by [[Glorfindel]], one of the [[Calaquendi|High Elves]], who was sent by Elrond to help Frodo after he heard of him from Gildor. Glorfindel, seeing that Frodo was starting to fade, put him upon his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and ordered him to go on when the Ringwraiths approached. Asfaloth outran the steeds of the Nazgûl and bore Frodo across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, who was on the brink of becoming a [[Wraiths|wraith]], turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. The Riders, were driven into the [[Bruinen|River]] by Glorfindel, Strider and the three hobbits, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> As a sign that Frodo was shifting to the [[Wraith-world]], he could see the [[Unseen]] [[Light of Valinor|luminous form]] of Glorfindel.

Unconscious, Frodo was carried inside Rivendell, where Elrond removed the fragment of the knife from his shoulder. He awoke two days later, mostly recovered, and was delighted to find that Gandalf had arrived.  Frodo's recovery was celebrated with a feast during which he met [[Glóin]] and asked concerning the [[Dwarves of Erebor]]. Afterwards, Elrond led his guests to the [[Hall of Fire]], where Frodo found Bilbo, whom he hadn't seen in seventeen years. Bilbo asked to see the Ring and was saddened to see Frodo's negative reaction.  The two hobbits then enjoyed talking about Bilbo's [[Translations from the Elvish|works on lore]] and [[the Shire]].<ref name=""Meetings"">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

===Fellowship of the Ring===
{{seealso|Quest of the Ring}}
During the [[Council of Elrond]], it was decided that the Ring must be destroyed by casting it into the [[Cracks of Doom]]. Frodo volunteered to be the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and a [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] was formed to protect him; the fellowship included Gandalf, Aragorn (Strider's real name), [[Boromir]] of [[Gondor]], [[Legolas]] of the [[Woodland Realm]], [[Gimli]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and Frodo's friends Sam, Merry and Pippin.<ref name=""council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref> Before their departure, Bilbo gave Frodo his sword, [[Sting]], and his [[Mithril-coat]] to protect him on the perilous journey to [[Mount Doom]] that lay ahead.

On [[December 25]], the fellowship left Rivendell, and headed south along the west side of the [[Misty Mountains]]. They attempted to cross them by the Redhorn gate, but were thwarted by a fierce blizzard <ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> and had to go back. After surviving a [[Wargs|Warg]] attack, Gandalf persuaded the company to go through the abandoned [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] kingdom of [[Moria]]. Just before entering Moria, Frodo was attacked by the [[Watcher in the Water]] and barely escaped. During the journey through Moria, Frodo began to suspect that something was tracking them. Later, inside the [[chamber of Mazarbul]], the Fellowship was attacked by [[Orcs]], and Frodo was struck by an Orc spear but was saved by the mithril coat he wore. The company escaped the chamber, and were close to exiting Moria, when [[Durin's Bane]] appeared and pursued them to the [[bridge of Khazad-dûm]] where Gandalf held him off so the rest of the Fellowship could escape. After breaking the bridge, both he and the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] fell and disappeared into the chasm below, after which Aragorn took over as leader.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - The Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|''The Mirror of Galadriel'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Eventually they reached [[Lothlórien]], and were housed by the elves at [[Caras Galadhon]]. During their rest there, [[Galadriel]] allowed Frodo and Sam to look into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]], in which they saw many things.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> When leaving the Woods, Galadriel gave Frodo a [[Phial of Galadriel|vial]] with light from the [[Silmaril]] of [[Eärendil]].<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

They travelled down the [[Anduin]] river in boats given to them by the elves. On their trip down the river, Frodo confirmed his suspicion that they were being trailed by Gollum. At [[Amon Hen]], the Ring's corrupting power caused Boromir to try to take the Ring from Frodo, who escaped by putting it on. Seeing the corrupting influence of the ring on Boromir, he then decided to leave the Fellowship and go on alone, but he was thwarted in this when Sam discovered him attempting to cross the [[Nen Hithoel]], and insisted on accompanying him.

===Emyn Muil to Ithilien=== 
The two companions reached [[Amon Lhaw]] and toiled through the [[Emyn Muil]]. Soon after, they found Gollum following them, and they captured him with the [[Elven rope]]. 
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Through the Marshes.jpg|thumb|left|''Through the Marshes'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Frodo decided to trust Gollum to be their guide. He led the Hobbits out of the Emyn Muil and through the [[Dead Marshes]]. During their route, they were delayed several times by a [[Nazgûl]] flying on a [[Fell beasts|fell beast]]. The Hobbits reached [[Carchost]], the western [[Towers of the Teeth|Tower of the Teeth]], where Frodo had intended to enter Mordor, but Gollum persuaded Frodo to follow him to a safer entrance, the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]]. During the next night's march they passed into [[North Ithilien]], and by daylight of [[March 7]] they reached the stream of [[Henneth Annûn]].

Their camp fire attracted the [[Rangers of Ithilien]], and their leader, [[Faramir]] (Boromir's brother), considered them spies and questioned Frodo concerning their errand, who recounted the journeys of the Fellowship, but said nothing about the Ring. Faramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement. Faramir blindfolded the Hobbits and led them to Henneth Annûn, a secret Gondorian outpost, and questioned them further in private. After a meal, Sam accidentally revealed that Frodo had the Ring, but Faramir denied its lure, and thus gained the trust of the hobbits.

During the night, Faramir called Frodo and Sam to him, and showed them Gollum, who had found his way to Henneth Annûn, and (ignorant of their presence) was hunting for [[fish]]. Faramir, suspecting that Frodo had lied about Gollum's involvement in their quest, threatened to kill him for fear that he might reveal the location of their outpost to the enemy. Frodo confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, and begged Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. The following morning Faramir released the three travellers, warning them strongly against taking the pass of Cirith Ungol.

===Entering Mordor===
[[File:John Howe - Shelob About to Leap on Frodo.jpg|thumb|left|''Shelob About to Leap on Frodo'' by [[John Howe]]]]
After two marches they came to the valley of the [[Morgulduin]] and continued east. On the ""[[Dawnless Day]]"" Gollum lead them east to the [[Southward Road]] and reached the [[Cross-roads]] just as the sun was setting.<ref>{{TT|Journey}}</ref> They reached just opposite the north-facing gate of [[Minas Morgul]] and they saw the Morgul-host march forth.

In that night they ascended the [[Straight Stair]] and reached the top of the [[Winding Stair]] at dawn of [[March 11]] where they were woken by Gollum. He led the up the to the entrance to [[Shelob's Lair]]. Inside the tunnel Gollum betrayed Frodo and Sam to [[Shelob]] the [[Spiders|spider]], who stung Frodo after he left the tunnel. Sam saved Frodo from being eaten by Shelob, but thought him dead and took the Ring from him, resolving to continue the Quest alone. However Frodo (who was still alive) was captured by Orcs and taken to the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

===Cirith Ungol to Mount Doom===
[[File:John Howe - Mount Doom II.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Mount Doom'' by [[John Howe]] ]]
Learning of this, Sam rescued Frodo and on early [[March 15]] the Hobbits escaped and jumped into the ravine west of the [[Morgai]] and crossed the valley. The next day they attempted to climb the Morgai, but had to retrace their steps and reached the north end of the valley, and on [[March 18]] they  set out on the road that ran to the [[Carach Angren|Isenmouthe]]. There they were overtaken by an Orc troop and had to follow their trot.

As Sauron's troops moved at night, the hobbits continued their journey in daytime towards Mount Doom. During the morning of [[March 25]] they reached the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]] where, at the last moment, Frodo, under the influence of the Ring, claimed it as his own. However, at that moment he was attacked by [[Gollum]], who seized the Ring and then fell into the fire with it, thus destroying the Ring.

By then, this pressure of the ring reached its maximum, which was impossible, ""especially after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted."" Frodo had done what he could, and by then he was simply incapable of making a conscious decision to destroy the Ring.<ref>{{L|246}}</ref>

===Return home===
Frodo and Sam were rescued by [[Gwaihir]], [[Landroval]] and [[Meneldor]] and taken to [[Ithilien]]. After being healed and having rested for a month, the Ring-bearers were honoured on the [[Field of Cormallen]]. The following months the Hobbits witnessed the coronation of their companion Aragorn as King Elessar, and were present at his marriage to [[Arwen]] that summer. Arwen renounced her [[immortality]] and gave to Frodo her place to sail into the [[Uttermost West|West]]. She also gave to Frodo a white gem on a silver necklace that she claims would aid him when he remembers the fear and darkness of the toll the ring took on him.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

Frodo and his company left Minas Tirith on [[July 19]] for [[Edoras]] and the funeral of King [[Théoden]], then set out for the [[Hornburg]] and eventually [[Isengard]]. They parted there from Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn.

After overtaking Saruman and [[Gríma|Wormtongue]], they reached the [[Mountains of Moria]]; and when they approached [[Lothlórien]], [[Celeborn]] and Galadriel parted from their company. The hobbits, with Gandalf and other Elves, reached Rivendell on [[September 21]], where Frodo met Bilbo once again.

They stayed there until [[October 5]] and eventually visited the ''Prancing Pony'' in Bree before reaching the Shire. At the Buckland Gate Gandalf left them to go and have a talk with Tom Bombadil. Once in the Shire, they reached [[Frogmorton]] where they were arrested. The next day they reached [[Bywater]] where they defeated the [[ruffians]] who had overtaken their land. The leader of the ruffians was revealed to be Saruman, and Frodo decided to let him live, even after he had tried to stab him with a knife. But Saruman did not live much longer, for his servant, Wormtongue, killed him himself (before being killed by the hobbits), thus ending the [[War of the Ring]].

===Later years===
[[File:Francesco Amadio - Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|220px|''Grey Havens'' by [[:Category:Images by Francesco Amadio|Francesco Amadio]]]]
Over the next two years, the travellers reordered the Shire and their lives; but Frodo was still troubled by his wounds, falling ill every [[13 March]] and [[6 October]], clutching the white gem in a manner reminiscent of the One Ring. Frodo served as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] until [[Will Whitfoot]] was restored in {{SR|1420}}.<ref name=""chief"">{{App|Chief}}</ref> Having no family of his own, Frodo left his estate ([[Bag End]]) and passed on the [[Red Book of Westmarch|Red Book]] to Samwise Gamgee, who named [[Frodo Gardner|his son]] after Frodo.

On [[September 21]] of {{TA|3021}} Frodo set out for the [[Grey Havens]]. Going south to Woody End he met the [[Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings]], Elrond, Galadriel, and Bilbo. On [[September 29]] they came to the firth of [[Lhûn]] where Gandalf awaited them, and on the [[White Ship]]<ref name=""chief"" /> they crossed the [[Straight Road]] into the West. Frodo would spend the rest of his days in ""a period of reflection and peace"" on [[Tol Eressëa]], giving him the opportunity to truly understand his position in [[Arda]] before passing beyond the [[Circles of the World]].<ref>{{L|246}}: ""a gaining of a truer understanding of his position...""</ref>

==Legacy==
According to [[Elanor Gardner]], Sam followed Frodo across the sea on September 22, 1482 following the death of his wife [[Rose Cotton|Rose (née Cotton)]].<ref>{{App|B5}}: ""''Among them the tradition is handed down from Elanor...''""</ref>

At some point well into the [[Fourth Age]], the words ""''Frodos Dreme''"" appeared scrawled at the head of a poem, [[The Sea-Bell]], within the Red Book, possibly derived from the nightmares that Frodo had before passing into the West.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}: ""''It is the latest piece and belongs to the Fourth Age...''""</ref>

==Characteristics==
The only real description of Frodo's appearance was given only once by Gandalf in his letter to Barliman Butterbur, in which he was declared a ""stout fellow with red cheeks, taller than some (hobbits), and fairer than most"", with a cleft chin, a bright eye, and a perky personality.<ref name=""Strider"" /> Although Frodo was apparently fairly stout before his journey, he seemed to have lost a significant amount of weight on his trip from Hobbiton to Rivendell.<ref name=""Meetings"" />  Also, at a later point, Sam remarked that Frodo was ""too thin and drawn"" for a hobbit.<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}</ref>

Frodo carried a small Elven sword called [[Sting]] and wore a coat of Dwarven mail made of ''[[mithril]]'' under his clothes, both given to him by Bilbo. In [[Lothlórien]], [[Galadriel]] gave him an [[Elven cloaks|Elven cloak]] that helped him blend in with his natural surroundings and a phial carrying the light of the [[Star of Eärendil]] to aid him on his quest.

Before Frodo returned to the Shire after the Quest of the Ring was completed, Arwen Evenstar, wife of Aragorn and daughter of Elrond, gave Frodo a white gem on a silver necklace to wear around his neck.

Frodo is said to have shown great ""skill with foreign sounds"" and probably could pronounce [[Elvish]] correctly, more than other Hobbits (who pronounced long Elvish vowels as diphthongs).<ref>{{App|Vowels}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Frodo Baggins'' is an English translation of his [[Westron]] name '''[[Maura]] [[Baggins Family|Labingi]]'''. The name ''Maura'' has the element ''maur-'' (wise, experienced), which Tolkien equated to the Germanic element ''frod-'' of the same meaning. Frodo's name in [[Sindarin]] was '''''[[Iorhael]]''''' (""old-wise"") although in some instance he is mentioned as '''Daur''' (probably [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''[[taur]]'').

''Frodo'' is a real name, which comes from the Gemranic tradition with ''Fróda'' being its [[Old English]] form. It is obviously connected with the Old English word ''fród'', which means ""wise by experience"", but it was connected mythologically with legends of the Golden Age in the North.<ref>{{L|168}}</ref>

In the German translation he is called ''Frodo Beutlin'', in Spanish, ''Frodo Bolsón'', in French, ''Frodon Sacquet'', or ''Frodo Bessac'' (in the latest translation of the books), in Norwegian, ''Frodo Lommelun'', in Danish, ''Frodo Sækker'', in Faroese, ''Fróði Pjøkin'', in Finnish, ''Frodo Reppuli'', in Swedish, ''Frodo Secker'', in Portuguese, ''Frodo Bolseiro'', in Czech, ''Frodo Pytlík,'' and in Dutch, ''Frodo Balings''. In one of three Polish translations he is called ''Frodo Bagosz'', but he keeps his original name in the other two.

{{quote|Of all the children of Finwë he is justly most renowned: for his valour was as a fire and yet as steadfast as the hills of stone; wise he was and skilled in voice and hand; truth and justice he loved and bore good will to all, both Elves and Men, hating Morgoth only; he sought not his own, neither power nor glory, and death was his reward.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', ""[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]"", §94}}

'''Fingon''' was a [[Noldor]]in prince, and later second [[High King of the Noldor]], noted for his skill in battle and was thus named ""the Valiant"" by his cousin [[Maedhros]].

Fingon was the eldest son of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Anairë]], and he was the older brother of [[Turgon]], [[Aredhel]], and [[Argon]]. Fingon led the largest host in the [[Flight of the Noldor]] from [[Aman]] to [[Middle-earth]] where he then ruled over [[Dor-lómin]] and [[Hithlum]]. He ruled the Noldor as High King from {{FA|456}}, following the death of his father in single combat with [[Morgoth]]. However, Fingon is mostly remembered for his friendship with Maedhros, who he rescued from the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]], and for the manner of his death in battle with the [[Balrog]] [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. He was succeeded as High King by his brother [[Turgon]], who ruled the Noldor from [[Gondolin]].

==History==
===In Aman===
Fingon was born in the [[Year of the Trees 1260]],<ref>{{NM|P1xxii}}</ref> being the eldest child of [[Anairë]] and [[Fingolfin]], second son of [[King of the Noldor]] [[Finwë]].<ref name=Finwe/> Whilst in [[Aman]] he lived in [[Tirion]], home of the [[Noldor]] in [[Eldamar]].<ref name=""Eldamar"">{{S|Eldamar}}</ref>

In {{YT|1495}}, [[Morgoth]], with the help of [[Ungoliant]], destroyed the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]], stole the [[Silmarils]] from the fortress of [[Formenos]] and killed Finwë.<ref name=""AA"">{{AA|107-128}}</ref> In anger, Fingon's uncle [[Fëanor]] made a [[Speech of Fëanor|speech in Tirion]] and, with [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]], made [[Oath of Fëanor|an oath]] to recover the Silmarils and lead the Noldor in to Beleriand. Fingon did not support Fëanor, however he was moved by Fëanor's words, and he desired to see wide unguarded lands and to rule there a realm at his own will.<ref name=""Flight"">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

During the [[Flight of the Noldor]], Fingon led the largest host and his people supported Fëanor in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|First Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]]. Once the host reached [[Araman]] in {{YT|1496}} there was great debate about how to reach [[Middle-earth]]. Fëanor's people secretly took all the [[Swan-ships]] and passed over the sea to land at [[Firth of Drengist]]; [[Maedhros]] - who was friendly with Fingon - wanted to send the ships back first to retrieve ""Fingon the valiant"" but Fëanor burnt the ships at [[Losgar]].<ref name=""Flight""/> Fingon, with the rest of the Noldor of Fingolfin and his cousin [[Finrod]], had to cross the dangerous grinding ice of [[Helcaraxë]] with much loss of life. They arrived in Middle-earth in {{YT|1500}}, after Fëanor had been killed in the second [[Battles of Beleriand|battle]] of [[Beleriand]], [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]].<ref>{{GA|52}}</ref><ref name=""Return"">{{S|Return}}</ref>
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Speed now this feathered shaft.jpg|thumb|left|''Speed now this feathered shaft'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]

===Rescue of Maedhros===
In {{FA|1}}, soon after their arrival in Middle-earth following the rising of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the host of [[Fingolfin]] were attacked in the [[Battle of the Lammoth]]. Although victorious in battle against the [[Orcs]], Fingon's brother Argon was surrounded and killed.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 362</ref>

There was no great love between the Houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor following the latter's burning of the ships, causing the former to cross the Helcaraxë. Fingon resolved to rebuild the relationship between these two great houses of the Noldor, so in {{FA|5}} went on a noble quest to Thangorodrim to rescue his cousin and friend Maedhros who had previously been captured by [[Morgoth]]. Travelling alone, and unseen in the darkness, Fingon climbed across the cracks and crevices of Thangorodrim but could not find Maedhros. Then, in both despair and defiance, he took out his harp and sang a fair song of Valinor. Suddenly, above him,his song was taken up, and Maedhros sang among his torment. However, Fingon could not climb up to him and so Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow. But, as Fingon cried to [[Manwë]] to ""speed now this feathered shaft"", the great [[Eagles|eagle]] [[Thorondor]] swooped down and lifted Fingon up. Fingon could not break Maedhros's chains - being of evil design by Morgoth - and although Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, Fingon cut Maedhros's hand off at the wrist to free him. Borne back to [[Hithlum]] by Thorondor, Fingon's deed was praised as one of the most mighty amongst the Noldor. The hurt between the two houses was healed, and Maedhros waived the [[High King of the Noldor|High Kingship of the Noldor]] which then passed to Fingolfin.<ref name=""Realms"" />

[[Fingolfin]]'s people made their home in [[Hithlum]], mostly around [[Lake Mithrim]], and built the fortress of [[Barad Eithel]] to keep watch; in {{FA|7}}, at Maedhros's suggestion, Fëanor's sons moved to [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{GA|65-71}}</ref> The region of [[Nevrast]] was taken by Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] (until he moved to [[Gondolin]]), whilst the south-western region of Hithlum, [[Dor-lómin]], was given to Fingon to rule over.<ref name=""Realms"">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

===In Hithlum===
[[File:Victoria Clare - Fingon and Glaurung.jpg|thumb|''Fingon and Glaurung'' by [[:Category:Images by Victoria Clare|Victoria Clare]]]]
Following the great victory of the [[Noldor]] in the [[Dagor Aglareb]], the Glorious Battle, Fingon lived in a watchful peace known as the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name=""Return""/> In {{FA|155}}, [[Morgoth]] sent a force of along the coast to [[Drengist]] to attack [[Hithlum]] from the west. Having been seen by the [[Noldor]], Fingon heavily defeated the Orcs, causing Morgoth to realize that orcs alone were no match for the Elves.<ref>{{GA|155}}</ref> Over a hundred years later in {{FA|260}}, the great [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] came forth from [[Angband]] to attack the Elves;<ref name=""GA260"">{{GA|260}}</ref> although a new breed of [[fire-drakes|fire-drake]], Glaurung was still relatively young and only half-grown. The Elves fled to [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Dorthonion]] as Glaurung defiled the [[Ard-galen]], but Fingon led a troop of archers on horseback to attack Glaurung. He could not withstand their arrows and fled, and for the next 200 years the peoples of [[Beleriand]] enjoyed the [[Long Peace]] and grew prosperous.<ref name=""Return"" /> In {{FA|416}}, [[Fingolfin]] granted [[Dor-lómin]] to the [[House of Hador]], the third house of the [[Edain]], and Fingon presented [[Hador]] with a [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin|Dragon-helm]] which eventually passed to [[Túrin]].<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 228</ref><ref name=""Narn"">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>
[[File:Marya Filatova - Fingon and Rochallor.jpg|left|thumb|Fingon and [[Rochallor]] by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
In winter {{FA|455}}, rivers of fire suddenly sprang forth from [[Angband]], turning the Ard-galen into the [[Anfauglith]]. This began the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the Battle of Sudden Flame.<ref name=""Ruin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> The dragon Glaurung, now fully grown, led armies of [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]] in battle that resulted in the deaths of many Elves and Men. The remaining forces of the Noldor were scattered following this heavy defeat. Perceiving the ruin of the Noldor, Fingon's father Fingolfin challenged Morgoth to single combat. Fingolfin fought valiantly, and although he died in the battle, Morgoth himself was wounded and never again fought in single combat. Fingon then became [[High King of the Noldor]].<ref name=""Realms"" /><ref name=""Ruin"" />

Seven years later, in {{FA|462}}, Morgoth sent a force of Orcs to attack Fingon's people in Hithlum. Galdor, son of Hador, died defending [[Eithel Sirion]] and his son [[Húrin]] took up the [[Lords of Dor-lómin|lordship of Dor-lómin]] and served Fingon thereafter. To the west, battle took place in Hithlum, and Fingon would have succumbed had it not been for a force of [[Falathrim]] elves under the command of [[Círdan]] who sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]] and helped defeat the Orcs.<ref name=""Ruin"" />

===Nirnaeth Arnoediad===
[[File:Steamey - Fingon in a battle with the Balrogs.jpg|thumb|right|''Fingon in a battle with the Balrogs'' by Steamey]]
Following the success of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Maedhros]] saw that Morgoth was not unassailable and was emboldened to form the [[Union of Maedhros]] of Elves, Men and [[Dwarves]]. Maedhros would attack from the east and Fingon from the west. They planned to trap Morgoth between the two armies.<ref name=""Fifth"">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> Unlooked for, Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] unleashed a force of ten thousand Elves from [[Gondolin]]. On seeing this, Fingon cried:

{{blockquote|'[[Utúlie'n aurë!]] Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatári, utúlie'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: 'Auta i lómë! The night is passing!'|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Fifth Battle]]""}}

However, Maedhros' army had been delayed following the betrayal of [[Uldor]]. [[Morgoth]] therefore sent his Orcs swiftly over the Anfauglith to taunt Fingon and draw out his forces. They held firm until the Orcs brought forth [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]] and cut off his legs, arms and head before them. [[Gwindor]], Gelmir's brother, was enraged by this; and he, with Fingon, led the charge. Gwindor and the elves of [[Nargothrond]] reached the doors of Angband but they were all slain save Gwindor, who was taken captive, for Fingon could not come to his aid in time.<ref name=""Fifth"" /> 

On the fourth day, Fingon retreated and met his brother Turgon on the plains of Anfauglith. Some hours later, the banners of [[Maedhros]] appeared on the battlefield and the Elves were heartened, believing victory was in their grasp. However, Morgoth then unleashed [[wolves]], dragons and Balrogs led by [[Glaurung]], who separated the hosts of Fingon and Turgon from Maedhros. This battle, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, was the most grievous for the Elves. Fingon, with a host of Men from [[Dor-lómin]] led by [[Húrin]], was surrounded. Eventually, being pushed back, Fingon fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], lord of [[Balrogs]] in battle, but was killed by Gothmog's black axe after another Balrog bound him with a whip. They beat him into the dust with their maces, and his banner, they trod into the mire of his blood. This brought an end to Fingon's realm in [[Hithlum]], and his brother Turgon became High King of the Noldor,<ref name=""Fifth"" /> whilst Húrin was captured and tortured personally by Morgoth.<ref name=""Narn"" />

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Fingon.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Fingon'' is the [[Sindarized]] version of version of his [[Quenya]] [[father-name]], '''''Findecáno''''' (""Hair-shout""), from ''[[findë]]'' (""hair"") + ''[[káno]]'' (""commander""). It is said it was given by his father as an echo of ''Finwë'' and because it fitted him due his long dark hair, combed in great plaits braided with gold.<ref name=Finwe/>

Read as proper [[Sindarin]], ''Fingon'' is composed of ''[[fin]]'' (""hair"") + ''-gon'' (""lord, prince"").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3451802205.html|articlename=S. ''Fingon'' n.|website=Eldamo|accessed=21 March 2021}}</ref>

At some point, [[Tolkien]] considered and rejected the name as ''Fingorn'', from ''fin(wë)'' + ''[[gorn]]'' (""revered"").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 112-113</ref> 

In the [[Noldorin]] phase of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name contains the elements ''find-'' (""skill"") + ''-gon'' (""valour"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""[[KAN]]"", ""PHIN-""</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
===Earliest versions===
[[Christopher Tolkien]] observed that in the very earliest versions of the legendarium, there is no mention of Fingon (or Fingolfin, Finarfin or [[Finrod]])<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, p. 173</ref><ref>{{LT1|Xn}}, p. 243</ref> However, when he first appears in ""[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]"" in the 1920s he is named '''''Finweg'''''<ref>{{LB|1}}, p. 5</ref> (and on one occasion ''Fingweg''),<ref>{{LB|1e}}, 102</ref> a name he retains in the ""[[The Quenta]]"" of the early 1930s even though his story closely matches that of the published ''Silmarillion''. A more significant difference is that originally Fingon spoke against [[Fëanor]] at [[Tirion]],<ref>{{MR|Annals}}, pp. 121, 125</ref> whilst in the later 1951 version of ''Quenta Silmarllion'', Fingon and [[Turgon]] did not take part in the Kinslaying at [[Alqualondë]].<ref>{{MR|P3I7}}, p. 196</ref>

Fingon is renamed from ''Finweg'' the 1930s around the time of the ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'',<ref>{{SM|7Ic}}, p. 316</ref> and was firmly ''Fingon'' by the time [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] reworked the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' in 1937-8.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, passim</ref> In an [[Old English]] version of the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', Fingon's name is given as '''''Finbrand'''''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 213</ref>

===Later versions===
In the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Fingon was the father of [[Gil-galad]], which was a brief idea that Tolkien had, but this inclusion was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien who admitted it would have been better had his parentage remained obscure and that Gil-galad being the son of [[Orodreth]] was Tolkien's ""last word on the subject"". Furthermore, before his death Tolkien corrected the last of the genealogical tables, where Fingon's wife and chidren (including [[Erien]] and [[Finbor]]) were struck out, and thus in ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' Fingon was once and for all mentioned as wifeless and childless elf-lord.<ref name=Shibboleth/><ref name=Galad/><ref>{{WJ|Ruin}}, pp. 242-3</ref>

'''Indis''' was a [[Vanyar|Vanya]], the second wife of [[Finwë]]. She was renowned for her swiftness of foot as well as her skill at singing.<ref name=Later>{{MR|P3II4}}, §23-27 pp. 261-2</ref>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Indis was born at [[Cuiviénen]] before the [[Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to [[Aman]].<ref>{{NM|P1xvii}}, pp. 127/8 & 142</ref> She was close kin to [[Ingwë]], King of the [[Vanyar]] (see [[#Other versions of the legendarium|below]]).

=== Early years in Aman ===
At some point while the Noldor and Vanyar dwelt together in [[Tirion]], her heart turned towards Finwë, though he was wed to [[Míriel Þerindë]]. When Ingwë and the Vanyar left Tirion to dwell in the plains of [[Valinor]], Indis accompanied them and stayed near Ingwë's house on the western slopes of [[Taniquetil]]. During this time, Indis often wandered the fields of Valinor alone, singing.<ref name=Later/>

After the birth of [[Fëanor]], Míriel chose to die and refused to be reembodied or healed, leaving her husband Finwë in an unfair widowhood. Ingwë, seeing Finwë's grief, invited him to leave Tirion and dwell in the light of the Trees for a season, to bring him some distance from the memories of his loss. Initially Finwë declined this invitation, but later thought better of it and departed Tirion for the house of Ingwë. In his journey along the paths of the Mountain, Finwë chanced to encounter Indis; in that moment his heart turned towards her, and they recognized their mutual love.<ref name=Later/>

{{blockquote|When Indis saw Finwë climbing the paths of the Mountain, and the light of [[Laurelin]] was behind him as a glory, without forethought she sang suddenly in great joy, and her voice went up as a song of the ''lirulin''<ref group=""note"">The lark.</ref> in the sky. Then Finwë heard that song falling from above, and he looked up and saw Indis in the golden light, and he knew in that moment that she loved him and had long done so. Then his heart turned at last to her; and he believed that this chance, as it seemed, had been granted for the comfort of them both. 'Behold!' he said. 'There is indeed healing of grief in Aman!'|[[Morgoth's Ring]], ""Later versions of the Story of Finwë and Míriel"", §26 p. 262}}

With the [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel]], [[Manwë]] allowed Finwë to take a second wife and Indis thus became the stepmother to Fëanor. Indis bore four children to Finwë: [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], [[Írimë]], and [[Finarfin]]. Fëanor never became close with his stepmother or half-siblings, and dwelt apart from them as soon as he was of age to do so.<ref name=Laws>{{MR|P3II3f}}, pp. 238-9</ref>

=== Unrest of the Noldor ===
The unrest in the House of Finwë – and among the Noldor in general – was exacerbated by a seemingly trivial linguistic matter. The [[Quenya]] spoken by all three kindreds of the Eldar at the time of their arrival in Aman included the letter and sound ''þ''. The Vanyar and [[Falmari]] retained this, but at some point after the departure of the Vanyar from Tirion, the Noldor had chosen to exchange ''þ'' for ''s'' in both writing and speech. This change would have turned Míriel's mother-name ""Þerindë"" into ""Serindë,"" but Míriel herself desired that her name continue to be spoken and written with ''þ''.<ref name=Serinde>{{PM|XI2}}, p. 333-6</ref>

As long as Míriel lived – and while he retained hope that she might return from death – Finwë himself retained ''þ'' in his speech in deference to Míriel. However, after her conclusive refusal to return to life, Finwë also adopted the change to ''s''. By this time, the shift was nearly universal among the Noldor – except by Fëanor, who closely identified ''þ'' with his late mother.<ref name=Serinde/>

When Indis wed Finwë, she ceased the use of ''þ'', which was part of her native [[Vanyarin]] dialect, and adopted ''s'' out of loyalty to her husband and to show her loyalty to her new people, the Noldor. However, Fëanor believed she did so in belittlement of his late mother, and thus made ''þ'' into a dire personal and political matter. He demanded that his House and all his true supporters use ''þ''; his opponents (and alienated former supporters) therefore became all the more committed to ''s''. This became yet another source and symptom of unrest among the fractious Noldor.<ref name=Serinde/>

In {{YT|1490}}, tensions between Fëanor and Indis' children boiled over. In a quarrel, Fëanor drew a sword against his eldest half-brother [[Fingolfin]], and for this crime was exiled from Tirion by edict of the Valar. Finwë accompanied his eldest son into exile to [[Formenos]], leaving behind Indis and his other children. Fëanor's wife [[Nerdanel]] also declined to go into exile, instead remaining in Tirion to dwell with Indis.<ref>{{MR|P3II4}}, pp. 278-9</ref> 

=== Following the death of Finwë ===
In {{YT|1495}} Melkor destroyed the [[Two Trees]] and [[Darkening of Valinor|Darkened Valinor]]; shortly after he further raided Formenos to steal Fëanor's [[silmarils]] and slew Finwë in the process. In the [[Halls of Mandos]] Finwë was reacquainted with Míriel, and when she informed him of her desire to live again he pleaded with [[Vairë]] to forgo his own return to life in Arda in exchange for Míriel to be reembodied. At this Vairë alleged that in his pity for Míriel, Finwë had forgotten Indis and his children. Finwë responded that his love for each woman did not diminish that for the other, and that he had already been parted from Indis, having not seen her for many years. He further stated that even if he did return, it would be of little comfort to her: her love was most for Fingolfin, and though she may miss his (Fingolfin's) father, she did not miss the father of Fëanor. Further, he stated that above all Indis wished to return to the halls of Ingwë and the peace of the Vanyar. This request was ultimately accepted by [[Mandos]].<ref>{{MR|P3II3f}}, pp. 252–3</ref>

The last that was known of Indis was that she, along with Findis, did not go into exile, but went to abide among the Vanyar in grief until such time as it seemed good to Manwë to restore Finwë to life.<ref name=Descendants>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 343</ref><ref group=""note"">In the same text, it is noted that very little was known of Aman following the departure of the Noldor, as while Elves visited [[Númenor]] often, only a small part of its lore and history survived its [[Akallabêth|Downfall]].</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Indis'' is [[Quenya]] for ""Great or Valiant Woman,""<ref name=Descendants/> but it is also glossed as ""wife, bride.""<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""NDIS"", ""NETH""</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Other uses of the name ""Indis"" ===
The name ""Indis"" first appears in ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'' (c. [[1950]]-[[1951|1]]) in reference to the only wife of Finwë.<ref name=AAm3>{{MR|P2h}}, Notes 3 and 5, p. 87}}</ref> When Tolkien first revisited the ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' c. 1951, he discarded the name ""Indis"" entirely, with the wife of Finwë being named ""Míriel.""<ref name=LQ1>{{MR|P3I6}}, §46b, p. 185}}</ref> 

Following the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien returned to the matter of the First Age and began the work of ""remoulding"" the existing texts with a view towards publication. This began with ''The Earliest Version of the Story of Finwë and Míriel'' (c. [[1958]]).<ref>{{MR|P3II9a}}, ''Note on Dating'', p. 300</ref> In this tale, the name ""Indis"" was given to a new character, ""Indis of the Vanyar,"" the second wife of Finwë.<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 207</ref> This Indis would also appear in the essay ''Laws and Customs among the Eldar''<ref>{{MR|Laws}}, p.237</ref> and subsequent revisions to ''Finwë and Míriel''<ref name=Later/> that were developed in connection with the ""second phase"" drafts of the [[Later Quenta Silmarillion|Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']] (all c. 1958). References to this new Indis were also inserted into the text of ''The Annals of Aman'' during this period.<ref name=AAm4>{{MR|P2k}}, Notes 4, p. 101}}</ref> 

=== Relation to Ingwë ===
==== Sister of Ingwë ====
In the Later ''Quenta'' second phase material in which she first appears (see above), Indis is consistently identified as the sister of Ingwë. In several of these written and typed drafts, Tolkien initially wrote ""close kin"" but emended this to ""sister."" 

==== Daughter of Ingwë ====
In c. [[1959]]-[[1960|60]], Tolkien became interested in the subject of the Elves' increase in numbers from the first Elves of the [[Awakening of the Elves|Awakening]] and drafted a series of generational schemes exploring the time periods involved. In two of these schemes Indis is identified as the daughter of Ingwë, rather than his sister.

In the first scheme, Indis was born at [[Cuiviénen]] to Ingwë and his wife [[Ilwen]] before [[Oromë]] discovered the [[Elves]]. In this scheme she also had an older brother, [[Ingwil]], as well as an unnamed younger sibling.<ref>{{NM|P1xvii}}, pp. 127-8</ref>

In the second scheme, she was likewise born at Cuiviénen before the Elves were discovered by Oromë. However, in this scheme her mother is not mentioned, and she was the ''eldest'' child of Ingwë with her younger sibling being born just before the start of the [[Great March]].<ref>{{NM|P1xvii}}, p. 142</ref>

An entry in the ''Words, Phrases and Passages'' (c. late '50s) published in ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 17]]'' also identifies Fingolfin's mother as ""the daughter of Ingwi.""<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 39</ref> Elsewhere in that text, ""Ingwi"" is defined as the ""people of Ingwë"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 154</ref>

==== Niece of Ingwë ====
Tolkien revisited the subject of Indis' parentage for the last time in the essay ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' (c. [[1968]]), in which Indis is identified as ""Indis of the House of Ingwë.""<ref>{{PM|Case}}, p. 334</ref> In a contemporary excursus, ''The names of Finwë's descendants'', published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' as an appendix to the ''Shibboleth'', Tolkien stated that Indis ""is said to have been the daughter of King Ingwë's sister.<ref name=Descendants/>

==== Unspecified descendant of Ingwë ====
In a note on the above excursus, Tolkien stated that in the person of [[Eldarion]] ""the lines of all the Three Kings of the High Elves (Eldar), Ingwë, Finwë, and Olwë and Elwë were united and alone preserved in Middle-earth."" In an editorial comment on this note, Christopher Tolkien noted the apparent absence of direct descent from Ingwë to Eldarion, stating ""It is hard to know what my father had in mind when he wrote the opening of this note.""<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, Note 53, pp. 364-5</ref>

=== Fifth child ===
The Later ''Quenta'' second phase material names a fifth child of Finwë and Indis, [[Faniel]], who is not included in the list of Indis' chldren in the ''Shibboleth'' or ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Two positions in the birth order are attested for Faniel: in ''Laws and Customs''<ref name=Laws/> and the second draft of ''Finwë and Míriel'',<ref>{{MR|P3II4}}, Note 10, p. 265</ref> Faniel is the third child and [[Írimë]] is the fifth child. In the fourth and final revision of ''Finwë and Míriel'', Faniel is the fifth child and Írimë (here named ""Finvain"") is the third.<ref>{{MR|P3II4}}, author's footnote, p. 262</ref>

'''Angrod''' was a [[Noldor|Noldorin]] prince and son of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]]. He was born in [[Aman]], but joined the [[Exile of the Noldor]] and returned to [[Middle-earth]]. In [[Beleriand]], Angrod and his younger brother [[Aegnor]] ruled over [[Dorthonion]] as vassals of their elder brother [[Finrod]]. He was also the father of [[Orodreth]]. 

Angrod is most notable for his role as messenger between the Noldor and [[Thingol]]. He was the first Noldo to enter [[Doriath]] where he reported on the strength and array of the Noldor, and offered a glossed account of their return. When Angrod brought Thingol's decree on where the Noldor were permitted to settle to a [[Council in Mithrim|Noldor council]], it was not well received and [[Caranthir]] angrily deriding the sons of Finarfin acting as representatives of the Noldor, and even questioned their loyalty, causing Angrod to depart in wrath. Later, after Thingol learned rumour of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]], Angrod, still bitter from Caranthir's words, confirmed the story and further shared the full truth of the misdeeds of the [[House of Fëanor]]; in response, Thingol banned the speaking of [[Quenya]].

He, along with Aegnor, was slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (""Battle of Sudden Flame"").

== History ==
===Life in Valinor===
Angrod was born in Aman as the second son of Finarfin and Eärwen. Through his father, he was descended of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]], and [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]]; through his mother he was descended of [[Olwë]], King of the [[Falmari|Teleri of Aman]] and younger brother of [[Elwë]] (Thingol). Angrod was thus ¼ Noldo, ¼ Vanya, and ½ Teler. His elder brother was Finrod, and his younger siblings were Aegnor and [[Galadriel]].

Along with Finrod and Aegnor, Angrod was very close in friendship with the sons of [[Fingolfin]], as though they were all brothers.<ref name=princes>{{S|Princes}}</ref> He married [[Eldalótë]] and fathered [[Orodreth]].<ref name=descendants /><ref group=""note"">Orodreth being Angrod's son was a late development: in earlier legendarium material, including the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is Angrod's elder brother</ref>

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Angrod was present during [[Speech of Fëanor|Fëanor's speech]] where Fëanor claimed kingship and urged the Noldor to return to Middle-earth to win freedom and claim great realms. In this matter, Angrod stood with [[Fingon]] and Galadriel in a position of wishing to return to Middle-earth, but not accepting Fëanor as their leader. Finarfin in contrast urged caution to not act rashly and undertake deeds which could not be undone; at this Angrod held his peace and did not speak against his father.<ref name=flight>{{S|9}}</ref>

In the Exile of the Noldor, [[House of Finarfin|Finarfin's host]] marched in the rear, and were thus not present at the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. After a further great while, the hosts reached the borders of the empty wastes of [[Araman]] and heard the [[Doom of Mandos]]. At this, Finarfin and a great many of his people turned back, but his sons went forward as they would not forsake the sons of Fingolfin. After Fëanor stole the ships, the people of Fingolfin and Finarfin were stranded in Araman, and wondered long in misery until eventually venturing the cross the terror of the [[Helcaraxë]]. In this crossing, many were lost, and it was with a lessened host that they eventually arrived in Middle-earth.<ref name=flight />

===Life in Beleriand===
In {{FA|2}} the host of Fingolfin made camp on the north-shore of [[Lake Mithrim]] where there dwelt the [[House of Fëanor]]. Though Fëanor himself had since been slain, Fingolfin held [[sons of Fëanor|his sons]] to be accomplices, and there was peril of war between the Noldor until Fingon assuaged the hatred by his rescue of [[Maedhros]].<ref name=GA>{{WJ|One}}</ref>{{rp|§§58-61}}

In {{FA|6}}, due to their kinship, Thingol permitted those of Finarfin's house to pass through the [[Girdle of Melian]] and come to [[Menegroth]]. First of these was Angrod, who came as a messenger of Finrod. Angrod spoke at length with Thingol, and told him of the deeds of the Noldor, of their strength, and the ordering of their forces. However, deeming that the griefs had been forgiven, he did not speak of the misdeeds of Fëanor except for his valiant death. Thingol, in turn, gave Angrod a message to return to the Noldor: he gave them leave to dwell in [[Hithlum]], Dorthonion, and [[East Beleriand]], but he also cautioned that the Noldor properly conduct themselves, as he was the Lord of Beleriand and all shall hear his word. Lastly, he forbid any to enter [[Doriath]] except those he called as guests, or if he were sought in great need.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§63-64}}

In {{FA|7}} the Noldor held council in Mithrim. At this council Angrod came bearing the words of Thingol. The Noldor thought this to be a cold welcome, with the sons of Fëanor especially wroth at them. Caranthir, the harshest of the brethren, and who loved not the sons of Finarfin, angrily remarked on Angrod sharing so much information with Thingol, or even being a spokesmen of the Noldor at all; further he insinuated that they were forgetting that their father was a Noldo in favour of their mother's kin. At these words Angrod grew extremely wroth, and departed from the council.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§66-68}}

Following this, the Noldor partially encircled [[Angband]] on the west, south, and east. In the south, together with Aegnor, Angrod held Dorthonion as a vassal of Finrod. Their people were few as the land was barren and the great highlands behind were deemed a barrier that Morgoth would not lightly seek to cross.<ref name=Beleriand>{{S|14}}</ref> Among the people of Angrod were [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]].<ref>{{S|21}}</ref>

In {{FA|60}}, Morgoth issued a [[Dagor Aglareb|major attack]], with his main host set against Dorthonion. During this assault, Fingolfin and Maedhros led their own forces and hit Morgoth's host from either side, and it was destroyed utterly.<ref>{{LR|QS}}</ref>{{rp|102}} The Noldor then tightened their leaguer, establishing the [[Siege of Angband]].

In {{FA|67}}, Thingol was informed by [[Círdan]] of the whispered tales of the deeds of the Noldor before they came to Beleriand. It chanced that the sons of Finarfin were guests of Thingol at this time, having come to see Galadriel. Thingol spoke in ire to Finrod, chastising him for concealing so great a matter as the kinslaying, and coming to his board ""red-handed"" from the slaying of his own mother's kin, and seeking no pardon for it. Finrod, loath to defend himself by casting blame on the other princes of the Noldor, remained silent. Angrod, however, still bitter from the words of Caranthir, spoke openly against the sons of Fëanor, and told Thingol the truth of the kinslaying, the doom of Mandos, and of the burning of the ships at [[Losgar]]. Thingol was long silent before speaking. He commanded the sons of Finarfin to depart, as his heart was hot, but that they may in time return as he would not shut his doors forever against his kin. He stated he would also keep friendship with the folk of Fingolfin, as they had atoned for such ill as they did, and that in their mutual hate of Morgoth such griefs shall be lost. But, he also decreed that Quenya shall be held as the language of those who slay kin unrepentant, and thus banned all [[Sindar]] from speaking or answering to it.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§100-107}}

In {{FA|410}} the [[House of Bëor]] was granted the fiefdom of [[Ladros]] within Dorthonion.<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref>

In {{FA|422}}, with the strength of Men being added to the Noldor, Fingolfin pondered an assault against Angband; he knew they lived in danger while Morgoth was free to prepare and devise whatever evils he might and reveal them at his whim. But, because their lands had grown fair, and in such an attack many would surely perish, most of the Eldar were reluctant.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§133}} Of the Noldorin princes, only Angrod and Aegnor supported this, and it ultimately did not come to pass.<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

In {{FA|455}}, Morgoth [[Dagor Bragollach|broke the Siege of Angband]] and both Aegnor and Angrod were slain in following assault.<ref name=Fingolfin />

== Characteristics ==
Like his brothers and sister, Angrod had golden hair. Early in his life he developed hands of great strength.<ref name=descendants>{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>

When he first meets with Thingol he is described as ""being true and wisehearted"".<ref name=GA />{{rp|§63}}

== Etymology ==
''Angrod'' is the [[Sindarized]] form of '''''Angaráto''''', being a combination of ''[[ang]]'' (""iron"") and ''raud'' (“lofty, high, noble”).<ref name=pe17>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|49}}

== Other names ==
It is probable that Angrod's [[father-name]] was, like ''Findaráto'' (Finrod), originally just '''''Aráto''''' (""a noble”),<ref name=pe17 />{{rp|147}} and later differentiated.<ref name=descendants /> 

From his hands of great strength, he received the [[epessë]] '''''Angamaitë''''', being a combination of ''anga'' (""iron"") and ''[[maitë]]'' (""having a hand"", ""handed"").<ref name=pe17 />{{rp|110}}

Finarfin used Angrod's epessë as a differentiating prefix, and thus Angrod ended up with the father-name '''''Angaráto'''''. This name is given in the [[Telerin]] form, with the adjectival element placed second; in [[Quenya]], the more natural form would have been ''Artanga''.<ref name=descendants /> 

In ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]'', he was initially called '''Anrod'''.<ref name=""sketch"">{{SM|2}}</ref> 

In '' Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names'', he is called '''Angel''';<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> in Old English, this could mean either a ""fisherman's hook"", or the modern meaning of ""divine messenger"".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxondictio00tolluoft/page/40/mode/2up ''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary : based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]'', from the [[The Shaping of Middle-earth|fourth volume]] of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'',  ''Anrod'' was the third son of Finrod (Finarfin), following Felagund and Orodreth,<ref group=""note"">This was an emendation from him following Orodreth and Felegoth</ref> and preceding Egnor (Aegnor). During Fëanor's speech he, along with Orodreth and Egnor, sided with the sons of Fëanor. Following the breaking of the [[Siege of Angband]], Felagund and his brothers founded the realm of Nargothrond, aided by Celegorm and Curufin.<ref name=""sketch""/>

In ''[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor]]'', the friendship of Orodreth, Angrod, and Egnor is more specifically given to [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], who loved them in return. So great was their friendship that Orodreth, Angrod, and Egnor, alone among those not of the host of Fëanor, sailed to Middle-earth with Fëanor in the stolen ships. Angrod and Egnor eventually perish in the breaking of the Siege.<ref>{{SM|Valinor}}</ref>

In the 1937 ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', from the [[The Lost Road|fifth volume]] of ''The History of Middle-earth'', when Finrod (Finarfin) turned back from Exile, Angrod and Egnor went not with him as they would not forsake their friends Celegorm and Curufin.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>

In ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', from the [[Morgoth's Ring|tenth volume]] of ''The History of Middle-earth'', an earlier version had Angrod still standing by Fingon, but with Fingon supporting Fingolfin against Fëanor.<ref>{{MR|P2n}}</ref>{{rp|note 12}}

<center>{{Quote|But in after days he rose like a shadow of Morgoth and a ghost of his malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous path down into the Void.|''[[Valaquenta]]'': Of the Enemies}}</center> 

'''Sauron''' was a highly gifted [[Maiar|Maia]], originally an apprentice of [[Aulë]], who became skilled at crafting and making. Coveting the power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he joined with [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. As ""Gorthaur"" he became the most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth, being reckoned as the greatest of his allies and servants in the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars of Beleriand]]. From his fortress of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], Sauron was directly responsible for the death of [[Barahir]] and later the [[Noldor]]in king [[Finrod]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]]. He demonstrated the ability to take the form of a wolf, a serpent, and a vampire.

After the downfall of Morgoth, Sauron continually strove to conquer [[Middle-earth]] throughout the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages. In the Second Age, under the guise of '''Annatar''', he deceived the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]], who under his guidance had created the [[Rings of Power]], whilst he secretly forged [[the One Ring]] in [[Mount Doom]]. Thus Sauron became ""'''[[Lord of the Ring|the Lord of the Rings]]'''"". Failing to corrupt the Elves, he assaulted the [[Westlands]], beginning a period called the [[Dark Years]], the first time he became known as the '''[[Dark Lord]]'''. The arrogant [[Númenóreans]], contesting their rule on Middle-earth, challenged him, and Sauron accepted to be brought to [[Númenor]] as a captive; however his influence corrupted the Númenóreans further - leading to the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. His spirit escaped, as did [[Elendil]] and his sons, founding the Realms in Exile of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. Elves and the [[Dúnedain]], formed the [[Last Alliance]] and, in {{SA|3441}}, Elendil and Elven [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]] died fighting Sauron. Following Sauron's defeat, Elendil's son, [[Isildur]], severed his Ringed finger and took the One Ring for himself.

In the Third Age, Sauron the Enemy returned to Middle-earth and, as the '''Necromancer''', took the hill of [[Amon Lanc]] as his fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]; one of his foremost servants, the [[Witch-king]], formed the realm of [[Angmar]] in the north of [[Eriador]]. Following an attack by the [[White Council]] in {{TA|2941}}, the Dark Lord Sauron returned to his fortress of [[Barad-dûr]] in [[Mordor]], marshalling his armies and using his two-faced ally, the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]. By {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins]] was in possession of the Ring, and he was led by [[Gandalf]] as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. Whilst Sauron waged the [[War of the Ring]] against the [[Free peoples]] of Middle-earth, Frodo Baggins, [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gollum]] reached Mount Doom on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}, and the Ring was destroyed. The breaking of the Ring caused Sauron's fall, and his stepping on Morgoth's path down into the [[Void]], resulting in the start of the [[Fourth Age]] and the [[Dominion of Men]]. 

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Maureval - Mairon.jpg|thumb|left|''Mairon'' by [[:Category:Images by Maureval|Maureval]]]]
{{quote|For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.|[[Elrond]]<ref name=""lotr-coe""/>}}
As one of the most powerful [[Maiar]], Sauron was [[Creation of the Ainur|created]] by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=""Ainu"">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of [[Time]], he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name=""SVala"">{{S|IId}}</ref> Here he became one of the Maiar of [[Aulë]], among whose people he was deemed mighty and surpassed only by the Smith himself,<ref name=""SVala"" /> and was known as '''''Mairon'''''.<ref name=""PE17.1"">{{PE|17}}, p. 183</ref><ref group=""note"">Although it could be possible the name 'Mairon' was adapted by the Elves to [[Quenya]] originally from [[Valarin]] name with the same meaning much later, this pure Valarin form vanished in history.</ref>

Mairon's virtue was his love for order, planning and coordination, disliking confusion and chaos. But his obsession with order gradually overshadowed his love for the other intelligent beings of Arda, who would benefit from his planning; it became the sole object of his will, the end in itself. He started admiring [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s power to realize his designs quickly and masterfully.<ref name=""myths"" /> 

Early on, already by the blissful [[Spring of Arda]], he was ensnared by Melkor, becoming his spy on the isle of [[Almaren]], the dwelling-place of the Valar.<ref name=""Annals"">{{MR|P2a}}, p. 52</ref> While [[Tulkas]] was asleep, Melkor ruined the [[Two Lamps]], and when Almaren was also destroyed, the [[Valar]] moved to the [[Aman|Blessed Realm of Aman]], still not perceiving Sauron's treachery.<ref name=""Valinor"">{{L|131}}: ""''… Sauron was a being of Valinor perverted to the service of the Enemy …''""</ref> Soon Mairon left the Blessed Realm for [[Middle-earth]], [[Sleep of Yavanna|in a dark time]] where Melkor dominated limitlessly, and bent the knee before him as his greatest and most trusted servant.<ref name=""SRings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Thus he came to be known as '''''Gorthaur''''' by the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] and '''''Sauron''''' by others. Sauron initially was not as evil as Morgoth, as he was serving someone and not himself;<ref name=""SVala"" /> and unlike Melkor, who wanted to unmake and corrupt the world, Sauron wished to rule it and do what he wanted with it.<ref name=""myths"">{{MR|Myths}}, pp. 394-398</ref>

After [[Morgoth]] made his great fortress of [[Angband]] in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]], he appointed Sauron to be its commander.<ref name=""SCaptivity"">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

===First Age===
{{quote|Sauron was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion was torment.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]""}}
At some point after the [[Awakening of the Elves]], it was Sauron who first discovered them and their dwellings.<ref>{{NM|P1xiv}}, p. 107</ref> Following their subsequent discovery by [[Oromë]], the Valar [[Battle of the Powers|made war against Melkor]] to protect them and though they stormed Angband and Utumno, they failed to find Sauron.<ref name=""SCaptivity"" /> Thus Sauron continued his evil operations; during the [[Great Journey|Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to Valinor, it is said that he may have been responsible for the affliction upon the [[Atyamar|land of the Elves]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]], forcing the [[Elves]] to resume their journey.<ref>{{NM|P1vii}}, pp. 50-51</ref>

With the unchaining of Morgoth and his subsequent destruction of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], the [[Sun]] first rose and ushered in the awakening of [[Men]]. Leaving Sauron in command of the war, Morgoth left Angband in secret to find the second-born kindred of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and to corrupt them to his will.<ref name=""SWest"">{{S|West}}</ref>

After the [[Fall of Fingolfin]], Sauron launched an attack on [[Tol Sirion]]. Utter fear descended upon [[Orodreth]] and those who defended the isle. Sauron assailed [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] and turned it into a watch tower for Morgoth. Therein Sauron sat and Tol Sirion the fair became [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the Isle of Werewolves.<ref name=""SFingolfin"">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Upon hearing of the deeds of [[Barahir]] and his companions, Morgoth ordered Sauron to find and kill them. [[Gorlim]], one of Barahir's companions, was captured and brought before Sauron. Sauron promised that he would free Gorlim and his wife [[Eilinel]] in return for information. Under the terror of Sauron's eyes, Gorlim revealed everything he knew, and thus the hiding place of Barahir was betrayed to the enemy. Subsequently, Sauron revealed Eilinel was dead and had Gorlim put to death.<ref name=""Beren"">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

[[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]], promised to avenge his father's death. He wandered throughout [[Dorthonion]] as an outlaw and achieved great deeds that were heard far and wide. Morgoth set a high price on his head and Sauron, commanding a great army of [[werewolves]] and [[fell beasts]], sought for Beren.<ref name=""Beren"" />

Later, [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], Beren, and their ten companions left [[Nargothrond]] in search of the [[Silmarils]]. Despite their being disguised as Orcs, Sauron espied them as they entered into the vale between [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] and was suspicious, as Orcs passing were supposed to report to him. He had them captured and they were brought to him. There Finrod and Sauron fought in songs of power; the strength of both was great, but Sauron was more powerful. He then stripped them of their Orc disguises but failed to discern who they were. He had them thrown into a dark pit where one by one they were devoured by a werewolf. Withstanding this horror, they refused to betray one another.<ref name=""Beren"" />

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Huan Subdues Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|''Huan subdues Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When all of their companions were dead, Finrod and Beren were the last who remained alive in Sauron's pit. When a werewolf went to attack Beren, Finrod Felagund used all his power to defeat it. In this he was successful. However, he was critically wounded and soon passed away. In that dark moment, [[Lúthien]] came to the bridge of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] and sang. From his tower of Minas Tirith, Sauron saw Lúthien and knew that it was the famous daughter of [[Melian]] and [[Thingol]]. He desired to capture her and hand her over to Morgoth. Therefore, he sent a wolf to the bridge, but it was quickly and silently slain by [[Huan]]. He sent many more, and each one Huan killed. Finally, he sent [[Draugluin]], sire of the werewolves of Angband. The fight between Huan and Draugluin was fierce. Eventually Draugluin fled and, before dying, he told his master that Huan was there. According to prophecy, Huan would not die until he had encountered the greatest of all wolves, so Sauron contrived to take on that role and defeat the hound. Therefore Sauron took on the form of a werewolf, the greatest the world had ever seen then, and went towards the bridge. So great was the terror of his approach that even Huan momentarily recoiled. Sauron leaped to attack Lúthien, but she drew her magic veil over his eyes, afflicting him with fatigue and blindness. Then Huan sprang upon Sauron and there they fought. The force of Sauron's malice alone left Lúthien weak and nearly unconscious, and the fighting was brutal and prolonged; however, he could not subdue the hound of [[Valinor]]. He was trapped within Huan's jaws and could not break free, even when he took the form of a serpent and finally his own shape. Rather than leave his physical form, he yielded to Lúthien, giving her control of the isle in return for his release. He then took the form of a vampire and fled to [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], filling the forest with horror.<ref name=""Beren"" />

After the [[War of Wrath]], with the downfall of [[Morgoth]] and the destruction of [[Thangorodrim]], Sauron adopted a fair form and repented his evil deeds in fear of the wrath of the Valar. [[Eönwë]] ordered Sauron to return to [[Valinor]] in order to receive the judgement of Manwë. Sauron was not willing to suffer such humiliation, and he instead fled and hid himself in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""SRings"" />

===Second Age===
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Sauron-Annatar and the creation of the One Ring.png|thumb|right|''Sauron-Annatar and the creation of the One Ring'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
It was {{SA|500|n}} years into the [[Second Age]] when Sauron started to stir again.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> Sauron decided that the [[Valar]] had forgotten about [[Middle-earth]] and he once again turned to evil; many Men in [[East]] and [[South]], already corrupted by Melkor, fell under the [[Shadow]] by following him.<ref name=""SRings"" /> By {{SA|882}}, [[Gil-galad]] sensed a shadow arising in the East and sent a [[Gil-galad's letter|warning]] to [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> Around {{SA|1000}} Sauron was alarmed by the growing power of the [[Númenóreans]], and chose [[Mordor]] as a land to make into a stronghold. He began the building of [[Barad-dûr]], the Dark Tower, near Mount Doom.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" />

Although Sauron long knew that [[Men]] were easier to sway, he sought to bring the [[Elves]] into his service, as they were far more powerful.<ref name=""SRings"" /> After lying hidden and increasing his power in secret, in {{SA|1200}} Sauron put on a fair visage, calling himself '''Annatar''', the Lord of Gifts, an emissary from the Valar.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ""[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]"", ""Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn""</ref> He was never welcome in [[Lindon]] as [[Elrond]] and [[Gil-galad]] did not trust him and refused to treat with him, although they did not perceive who he truly was.<ref name=""SRings"" /> 

Elsewhere Annatar was gladly received, especially in [[Eregion]], where only [[Galadriel]] distrusted him. The [[Noldorin]] smiths there learned much from him in art and magic, as their thirst for knowledge was great.<ref name=""lotr-coe"">{{FR|Council}}</ref><ref name=""lotr-toy"">{{App|SA}}</ref> Under the tutelage of Annatar and the leadership of [[Celebrimbor]], grandson of [[Fëanor]], the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], became more skilled than anyone save Fëanor himself. In the year {{SA|1500}}, when they reached the very height of their power, the Elves began the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], which according to Annatar, would help them preserve their powers over Middle-earth.

But Sauron was ready to begin his own plans, and in {{SA|1600}} - ten years after the completion of the Rings of Power - he created [[The One Ring]] to control the bearers of the other Rings. He invested most of his own power into the Ring as he forged it, so that it would be more powerful than the others. With its power he completed the building of the Dark Tower.<ref name=""SRings"" /><ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> 

But the Elves were not so easily ensnared, and as soon as Sauron put on the One Ring they and Celebrimbor were aware of him, and realised they were betrayed.<ref name=""lotr-coe"" /><ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> They hid their Rings from Sauron and did not use them. Sauron demanded that the other Rings be given to him, for they would not have been made without his knowledge. The Elves refused, and the War was inevitable.<ref name=""SRings"" />

====[[Black Years]]====
During this time, Sauron constructed the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor to prevent invasion, and raised massive armies of [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and Men, chiefly [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]] whom he dominated as a king and god. He had them make many fortified towns, and armed those under him with iron.<ref name=""SRings"" /><ref name=""dm"" /> 

The [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began in {{SA|1693}} and was a bloody conflict which destroyed Eregion and devastated much of Eriador.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> Celebrimbor was slain and his body tied to a pole paraded at the head of Sauron's legions.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> The Elves were pushed back almost to the Blue Mountains, while their Dwarven allies (who had also rejected Sauron) retreated behind the walls of [[Moria]] where Sauron could not assail them.

Sauron was the [[Dark Lord]] of almost all of Middle-earth beyond the coasts, but the [[Númenóreans]] responded to the Elves' call for aid and sent a relief force. With united forces, Sauron's army was driven back and defeated near the [[Sarn Ford]] and withdrew to [[Tharbad]] where he was reinforced. But the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] had sent a fleet up the river Gwathló and Sauron's army was [[Battle of the Gwathló|attacked in the rear and utterly defeated]]. The Dark Lord fled back to Mordor with little more than his own bodyguard and a handful of Orcs.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

Nonetheless, while Sauron's subsequent power never quite matched the height it had during the War with the Elves, many of his most powerful enemies' homelands had been devastated. As the Númenóreans established dominions around the [[Westlands]] (c. {{SA|1800}}),<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> Sauron's empire continued to expand to dominate barbarian Men as servants and worshippers to the far south and east.<ref name=""dm"">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> 

As the Elves had failed him, he had decided to distribute the Rings of Power to three corrupted lords of [[Númenor]]<ref name=""Akallabeth"">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> and [[Khamûl|an Easterling king]] and other five Men, as well as lords of the Dwarves. The Dwarves proved too hardy and resistant to their effects; but the Men eventually faded and in {{SA|2251}} they appeared as [[Ringwraiths]], his greatest slaves.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" />

Believing he would dominate all of Middle-earth, Sauron assumed many glorious titles: '''King of Kings''',<ref name=""L131"">{{L|131}}</ref> '''King of Men''',<ref name=""Akallabeth"" /> '''Lord of the Earth''',<ref name=""SRings"" /> and even '''Lord of the World'''.<ref name=""L131"" />

====On Númenor====
[[File:Elena Kukanova - The Temple of Melkor.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Temple of Melkor'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
This offended the arrogant [[Númenóreans]] who had already started to fall under the [[Shadow]]. The proud Númenóreans came to Middle-earth with great force of arms, and Sauron's forces fled. Realising he could not defeat the Númenóreans with military strength, Sauron allowed himself to be taken as a hostage to Númenor by King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] in {{SA|3262}}.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> 

There, he quickly grew from captive to adviser and was known as '''Zigûr''', the Wizard;<ref name=""Defeated"">{{HM|SD}}, ''passim''</ref> he seduced the King and further corrupted the people.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> He converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Darkness, becoming High Priest of a Melkor cult. He had the [[Nimloth (tree)|White Tree]] cut down and in its place raised a great [[Temple]] in which he performed human sacrifices, persecuting those who were still [[Faithful]]. Finally, he convinced the king to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself, claiming they would gain immortality. [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], the supreme God, then directly intervened: Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed.

Sauron was on Númenor in the Temple of Melkor and was caught in the ensuing [[Downfall of Númenor|flood]]. However, his spirit survived, although severely weakened by the destruction, and it fled back to Middle-earth.

====Against the Faithful====
Sauron's spirit returned to Mordor in {{SA|3320}},<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> where he slowly rebuilt his strength, although he was unable to assume a fair shape. From this point on he started to rule through terror and force, largely filling the fearsome role left vacant by his former master.

Meanwhile, a few faithful Númenóreans, led by [[Elendil]], were saved from the flood, and they founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in Middle-earth. Sauron still considered them his hated enemies and he launched a pre-emptive attack on Gondor in {{SA|3429}}.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> 

In response, the Númenóreans formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with the Elven-king [[Gil-galad]]. Learning of them, Sauron dispatched some [[Orcs of Mordor]] to the [[Misty Mountains]] to ambush them.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, Note #20</ref> He also burned the [[Brown Lands|gardens]] of the [[Entwives]] against the advance of the Allies down the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Allies reached Mordor and defeated Sauron's forces in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] in {{SA|3434}} and finally laid siege before [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> 

The siege lasted for seven years until {{SA|3441}}, when Sauron left his fortress, engaging in direct combat. Elendil and Gil-galad fought Sauron and vanquished him, but both were killed.<ref name=""lotr-toy"" /> [[Isildur]], son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claimed it. Later, the Ring betrayed him and was lost for more than two thousand years. After his defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, Sauron lost his ability to form a physical body for a great while.

===Third Age===
Sauron's defeat released his subjects, like the [[Easterlings]], from his tyranny, but they fell into chaos. Their tribes and kingdoms battled against each other and some withdrew to the hated west.<ref>{{UT|6b}}, p. 259</ref> Weakened by his defeat and the loss of the One Ring, it is thought that he fled to the far east to regain his power and strength before returning. 

It was not until c. {{TA|1000}} that Sauron could again begin to take shape in a physical living body. Worried by this prospect, the [[Valar]] sent [[Wizards|five]] [[Maiar]] from the West to assist the peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, pp. 388-389</ref>

His power was enough that he began again to throw a shadow across portions of [[Middle-earth]]. Apparently, Sauron's spirit managed to move some Easterlings, who invaded [[Rhovanion]] and came to the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #60</ref> 

====The Necromancer====
These moves coincided with the coming of the [[Shadow]] to [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> Around {{TA|1050|n}} he chose [[Amon Lanc|a hill]] in southern Greenwood as a place to build the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. At first, the [[Wise]] thought that this ""Necromancer"" was one of the [[Nazgûl]] who had returned and taken up residence in southern Greenwood.<ref name=""TA"" />

The year {{TA|1300}} marked Sauron's increased power, evidenced by ""evil things"" who multiplied and grew bold again, like the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and some of the [[Dragons]], who attacked the [[Dwarves]]; and the return of the Nazgûl, with the founding of the evil realm of [[Angmar]].<ref name=""TA"" /> In the following centuries, Sauron's subjects in Angmar, the East and the South concentrated against his ancient enemies. Kings [[Araphant]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] realised that a single force was coordinating the attacks on both of their kingdoms and that they needed to work together to combat this evil. However, Angmar was successful in destroying Arnor, and soon after the Nazgûl gathered in Mordor and [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|conquered]] [[Minas Ithil]] to prepare for Sauron's return; their final success was ending the [[King of Gondor|royal line]] of Gondor.<ref name=""SRings"" /><ref name=""TA"" /><ref name=""gondor"">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> As his shadow deepened, [[Durin's Bane|a balrog]] awoke, causing the desertion of [[Moria]].<ref name=""TA"" /> 
[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'' by [[John Howe]]]]
By {{TA|2060}} the power of Dol Guldur grew so much that [[the Wise]] were alerted that Sauron was returning. [[Gandalf]] entered the fortress in {{TA|2063|n}} but the shadow fled before him. Returning to the [[East]],<ref name=""TA"" /> Sauron started corrupting the [[Easterlings]] and forging a strong alliance between their tribes.{{fact}} The period of his absence was known as the ''[[Watchful Peace]]'', because the Shadow on Mirkwood had lessened and the Nazgûl stayed quiet in Minas Morgul,<ref name=""TA"" /> using this period to prepare for Sauron's return.

====Return to Dol Guldur====
The Necromancer returned in {{TA|2460|n}} more powerful, with many Men in his service, and again took up residence in [[Dol Guldur]].<ref name=""TA"" /> His return coincided with the One Ring revealing itself [[Third Age 2463|three years later]], falling in the hands of [[Gollum|a Stoor]]. Sensing the danger, the [[Wise]] formed the [[White Council]].<ref name=""TA"" /> 

The Necromancer's aims remained to gather the Rings of Power, find news about the One Ring, and eliminate the [[Heir of Isildur]], if one remained in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=""TA"" /><ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> In {{TA|2475}} the [[Uruk-hai]] exited Mordor and briefly conquered [[Ithilien]]. [[Third Age 2480|Some years later]] the Orcs of the Mountains organised themselves, blocking the passes to the West; Moria had been depopulated centuries earlier by the Balrog, and Sauron sent Orcs and [[Trolls]] there.<ref name=""TA"" /> Also under his shadow were the [[Balchoth]], who invaded Mirkwood and cooperated with Orcs to attack Gondor.<ref name=""stew"" /> Sauron's servants captured the [[King of Durin's Folk|Dwarf King]] [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and took [[Ring of Thrór|one]] of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Dwarf rings]] from him.<ref name=""TA"" /> 

Still investigating the Necromancer, [[Gandalf]] snuck into Dol Guldur in {{TA|2850|n}} and met the dying Dwarf King, learning that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron. [[Third Age 2851|The next year]], Gandalf informed the White Council and urged an immediate attack upon the fortress, but [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] had learned of the presence of the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] near the [[Gladden Fields]], and he thought it best to allow Sauron to build up his strength in order to reveal its location so that Saruman could seize it himself. Following this strategy, Saruman opposed Gandalf.<ref name=""TA"">{{App|TA}}</ref>

As his power was growing and his arising came closer, his minions moved again against Gondor; his agents stirred the [[Haradrim]] to resume attacking Gondor, while [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Orcs of Mordor]] infested [[Ithilien]]<ref name=""TA"" /><ref name=""stew"" /> but never managed to pass beyond Anduin, further into Gondor.<ref name=""hunt"">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> All this time Sauron apparently had learned about the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] where his old enemy Isildur was killed, shortly after his own demise, almost three millennia ago. He sent his minions to look for the One Ring around [[Anduin]] near the [[Gladden Fields]], not knowing that it had been already in the possession of [[Gollum|a Stoor]].<ref name=""TA"" />

====Attack of the White Council====
Considering the situations, and the occupation of the dragon [[Smaug]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], Gandalf was worried that Sauron's military assault against the [[West]] was a matter of time, and that he would use Smaug in his force; Gandalf started considering a simultaneous attack both against Dol Guldur and against Smaug, to weaken Sauron.<ref name=""erebor"">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
In {{TA|2939}}, Saruman learned that Sauron was searching for the Ring, and worried that he would find it sooner than he. In {{TA|2941|n}}, he conceded with Gandalf to [[Attack on Dol Guldur|attack Dol Guldur]].<ref name=""TA"" /> Indeed, in the meantime Gandalf managed to eliminate Smaug, and the Orcs of the Mountains were decimated in the [[Battle of Five Armies|ensuing battle]], allowing the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and [[Dale]] to flourish again.<ref name=""erebor"" /><ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

Although Gandalf was weakening Sauron's potential grasp in the [[Wilderland|North]],<ref name=""erebor"" /> Sauron had been expecting the White Council's attack against Dol Guldur and fled from there.<ref name=""TA"" />

====Return to Mordor====
The [[Nazgûl]] had been preparing [[Barad-dûr]] for Sauron's return, so it was easy for Sauron to return secretly to his old stronghold [[Third Age 2942|a year later]]. Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951}}, sent three Nazgûl back to Dol Guldur and started rebuilding the Dark Tower, and once it was completed, the [[Mount Doom]] erupted.<ref name=""TA"" /><ref name=""stew"">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

From then on, Sauron stayed in Barad-dûr to conduct his war on the [[Free peoples]]. The shadow of Mordor caused despair and sickness to the Gondorians, like [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]], and in his desperation, the Steward [[Denethor]], Sauron's most immediate enemy, used the [[Anor-stone]] to gain knowledge. That ''[[palantír]]'' was directly linked to the [[Ithil-stone]] that the Nazgûl had taken from Minas Morgul, and when Sauron used it, he discovered Denethor was using his. Sauron attempted to wrench the Anor-stone to his will, but failed due to Denethor's strength of will and birth-right to the stone. But this stressed and wore out the steward, who lost his hope.<ref name=""stew"" /><ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>

By {{TA|3000}}, the shadow lengthened, and Saruman, who was residing in [[Orthanc]], had secretly found and decided to use the [[Orthanc-stone]]. As happened with Denethor, Sauron linked with his mind, managing to corrupt him;<ref name=""TA"" /> from one of his wisest enemies, Saruman became one of his greatest allies.

Around {{TA|3009}}, [[Gollum]], who formerly bore the One Ring and now pursued its thief, ventured into Mordor and was captured by Sauron's minions. Gollum was tortured and interrogated for the following years,<ref name=""TA"" /> and before releasing him, Sauron learned that the One Ring had been found by [[Bilbo Baggins]] of [[the Shire]].

Sauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with or enslaved Men from the east and south. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and he was able at that time to send out his will over Middle-earth, so that the [[Eye of Sauron]] became a symbol of power and fear.

====The War of the Ring====
Sauron was alarmed when the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] captured Gollum,<ref name=""TA"" /> so in June of {{TA|3018}} he dispatched the Nazgûl to hunt for [[the One Ring]] in secrecy. To disguise the crossing of the Nine over the Great River, Sauron staged an [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack on Osgiliath]]. This feint served two purposes: first, to test the strength and preparedness of Denethor, and second and more importantly, to present the Nazgûl as merely a military asset, concealing from the [[Wise]] their true mission.<ref name=""hunt"" /> Denethor's forces were stronger than Sauron hoped, but Sauron took the eastern half of the city nonetheless. This allowed the Nazgûl to cross the Great River and begin their hunt.<ref name=""hunt"" /> Now knowing the measure of his enemy, Sauron continued to amass his forces in Minas Morgul and Mordor in preparation for the siege of Gondor.<ref name=""TT|IV4"">{{TT|IV4}}</ref>

By September, the Nazgûl had failed to discover the Shire, and Sauron's wrath and fear were mounting. Via messenger, Sauron ordered the Nine to discard secrecy in favour of speed and go to Isengard to confront Saruman about his knowledge of the whereabouts of the Ring. At this time, Sauron also conveyed to the Nine such dire threats as to dismay even the Lord of Morgul.<ref name=""hunt"" /> The Nine ultimately failed in their mission, being defeated and unhorsed by the flood of the Bruinen. The Witch-king returned alone to Mordor in December of 3018 to Sauron's great fear, for Sauron perceived that his foes still had strength left in them, and luck seemed to be on their side.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, ""The Ring Goes South"", p. 262</ref>

Sauron's next glimpse of the Ring (or so he believed) would come in the late hours of [[5 March]] T.A. 3019, when Pippin looked into the ''palantír'' of Orthanc that he had recovered from the flood of Isengard. Sauron, unaware of Saruman's defeat at hands of the [[Ents]], assumed Pippin was the Wizard's prisoner, and was being forced to look into the ''palantír'' as a form of cruel sport. Rather than interrogate Pippin immediately, Sauron chose to torment him, and bid him tell Saruman that he would send for the prisoner immediately.<ref>{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> He was therefore deceived into thinking the Ring was finally within his grasp.

A few hours later, on the morning of [[6 March]], Sauron encountered one of his foes in the ''palantír'' of Orthanc: Aragorn looked into the Stone, revealing himself to Sauron as the Heir of Isildur and wielder of [[Andúril]], the Blade Reforged. Aragorn spoke no word to Sauron and with a great effort of will wrested control of the Stone from him. As Aragorn intended, this played on Sauron's gnawing doubts and filled him with fear, believing that Aragorn might have overthrown Saruman, seizing Pippin and therefore the Ring. Thus, he ordered the Witch-king to launch his long-planned assault on Gondor immediately, rather than wait for all preparations to be made, hoping to destroy his enemies before they had a chance to make full use of the Ring's power.<ref name=""RKV2"">{{RK|V2}}</ref>

The death of the Witch-king and the defeat of his army in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] were a setback to Sauron, but he still had a great force of arms held in reserve in Mordor, more than enough to eventually secure military victory against all of his enemies combined. After his encounter with Aragorn in the ''palantír'', Sauron believed that one of his foes in Minas Tirith held the One Ring and would soon attempt to use it. As such, Gandalf was able to exploit Sauron's false beliefs with an audacious plan: the army of the Free Peoples would march on the Black Gate as a feint, keeping Sauron's Eye fixed upon them and blind to all else that moved, as the true Ringbearer made his way to Mount Doom.<ref name=""RKV9"">{{RK|V9}}</ref>

For the next nine days, Gandalf's plan worked - as the Host of the West made its way east and north, Sauron kept his entire focus upon it and diverted the whole strength of Mordor to the Black Gate to meet them. Even when Shagrat brought news of an ""Elvish"" intruder in [[Cirith Ungol]], Sauron's belief that the Ring was with the Host of the West remained unshaken and he made no attempt to investigate further; he could certainly not imagine that his enemies were trying to sneak the Ring into Mordor. Frodo and Sam thus made it to the [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]] undetected, and Sauron did not become aware of them until the very moment that Frodo claimed the Ring for himself.<ref name=""RKVI3"">{{RK|VI3}}</ref> [[File:Ted Nasmith - The Shadow of Sauron.jpg|thumb|''The Shadow of Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Only then did Sauron finally perceive Frodo and, realising he had been tricked, was overwhelmed with wrath and fear. He instantly lost all interest in the ongoing [[Battle of the Morannon]] and dispatched the Nazgûl from the skies above the battle to Mount Doom with all haste. It was too late; Gollum fell into the Crack of Doom with the Ring, destroying it and himself. In the moment of the Ring's destruction, Barad-dûr and many other of Sauron's fortresses crumbled to ruin. Sauron's spirit emerged and rose above Mordor like a black cloud - he stretched out his hand towards the army of the West, but even as he did so, he was blown away by a great wind and vanished.<ref name=""RKVI4"">{{RK|VI4}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Thus Sauron's power was unmade, and his dominion in Middle-earth came to an end. According to Gandalf, Sauron was ""maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape.""<ref name=""RKV9"" /> Sauron's corporeal body that was in the Dark Tower died, and without the Ring, his spirit no longer had the power to create a new one. Though his indestructible mind and being were bound forever to [[Eä]], Sauron had lost all power to effect his will upon the world<ref>{{L|200}}</ref> and could never again grow in strength.<ref>{{MR|P5VII}}, section iii, p. 403 and note 11, p. 407</ref>

It is said of Sauron, in summary of his long career of wickedness in Arda, that ""he rose like a shadow of Morgoth and a ghost of his malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous path down into the Void.""<ref name=""SVala"" />

==Characteristics==
Sauron was a being of exceptional power, both in personal might and in sorcery, yet his greatest strength lie in his cunning, intellect, and charisma; through persuasion, deception, and coercion, he brought ruin to many mortal realms and united others unto himself, often without ever having to physically intervene, and he nearly cast Middle-earth into darkness several times throughout his existence. 

Much like his [[Morgoth|master]], pride in his own abilities was his greatest personal weakness, and this arrogance, coupled with an underestimation of his enemies, would ultimately doom him.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

===Physical form===
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|Tolkien's unfinished sketch of Sauron, apparently showing him just after the destruction of the Ring]]
At first Sauron appeared as a royal and commanding figure in a strong body. He was also able to veil his power and change his shape. Later, however, he could take only a terrible form, of a stature greater than a [[Men|Man]]'s, though not giant,<ref>{{L|246}}</ref> ""an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure.""<ref name=""Akallabeth"" /> [[Isildur]] recounted that at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], Sauron's hand was black with a deadly burning touch.<ref name=""lotr-coe"" /> Gollum would also call him ""Black Hand"", noticing he only had four fingers after Isildur cut one off.<ref name=""Closed"">{{TT|IV3}}</ref>

===Eye of Sauron===
The '''[[Eye of Sauron]]''', called by various names, was the symbol of Sauron the Dark Lord following the loss of [[the One Ring]]. This symbol was adopted to show his unceasing vigilance and piercing perception, and was displayed on the weaponry of his servants, or at least the [[orcs]].

Sauron's Eye as Frodo sees it in the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] is the only feature of his later form described in detail. It is yellow and rimmed with fire, with a slit pupil, ""a window into nothing.""<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> The colour is compared to that of a cat's eye, but because of the references to Sauron's Lidless Eye, it may also resemble that of a snake, such as an adder. Readers differ as to whether Sauron's eyes were literally lidless and resembled what Frodo saw, or instead the Eye was only a symbol that Frodo saw in the Mirror in an elaborate form. 

Sauron's gaze, even indirectly, was known to wither, exhaust, and weaken his foes, with [[Denethor II|Denethor]], [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]], and [[Gandalf]] all rendered weary and dreadful after confronting him.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> The sheer malevolence Sauron exuded through his presence alone was enough to render Lúthien frail and nearly unconscious.<ref name=""Beren"" />

==Etymology==
{{pronounce|Quenya - Sauron.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
'''''Sauron''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈsaʊron]}})<ref group=""note"">''Sauron'' is pronounced ""sour-on"" (''sour'' as in not sweet).</ref> is a [[Quenya]] name, said to mean ""the Abhorred"".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ""Sauron""</ref>

Several accounts of the origin of the name ''Sauron'' were suggested in different linguistic manuscripts:
*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' (""foul, evil-smelling, putrid"", from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[THUS#Other versions|THUS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""[[THUS]]-""</ref>
*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' (""foul, vile""; from root [[SAWA]]). The manuscript continues saying that ''Sauron'' ""could be a genuine [[Sindarin]] formation from ''[[saur]]''; but is probably from Quenya"". However, this origin appears to have been rejected, as it is followed by the comment ""No. [[THAW|THAW-]], cruel. ''[[Saura]]'', cruel"" in the manuscript.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 183-4</ref>
*deriving from the [[Primitive Quendian]] form ''þaurond-'' (formed from the adjective ''þaurā'' ""detestable"", from root [[THAW]]).<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 380</ref>
*deriving from '''''Thauron''''', which includes the [[Sindarin]] element ''[[thaur]]'' (""abominable, abhorrent""; also found in [[Sauron#Other names|''Gor'''thaur''''']]).<ref name=""Appendix"">{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''gor'', ''thaur''</ref>

==Other names==
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Gorthaur.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
{{pronounce|Quenya - Mairon.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
{{Pronounce|Annatar.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Gorthaur''''' was a name used of Sauron by the [[Sindar]] during the [[First Age]],<ref name=""SVala"" /><ref>{{WJ|15}}, p. 240</ref> which was composed of the elements ''[[gor]]'' (""horror, dread"") and ''[[thaur]]'' (""abominable, abhorrent""), thus meaning ""Terrible Dread"";<ref name=""Appendix"" /> an alternate variation of this name was '''''Gorsodh'''''.<ref>{{WJ|One}}, entry 455, §153, p. 54</ref> The Quenya equivalent was '''''Ñorsus'''''.<ref name=""PE17.1"" />

In some of Tolkien's notes from the 1950s, it is said that Sauron's original name was '''''Mairon''''' ([[Quenya|Q]], ""the Admirable""), but this was altered after he was suborned by Melkor. He continued to call himself Mairon the Admirable, or '''Tar-mairon''' (""King Excellent""), until after Númenor's downfall,<ref name=""PE17.1"" /> although he could not use that name in Númenor, as it was a Quenya name with royal implications. There he was called '''''Zigûr''''',<ref name=""Defeated"" /> meaning ""Wizard"" in [[Adûnaic]].<ref>{{SD|3vi9}}, p. 437</ref>

'''''Annatar''''' is Quenya for ""Lord of Gifts"", from ''[[anna]]'' + ''[[tar]]''.<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''anna'', ''tar''</ref> It can be noticed that Morgoth used a similar name when he seduced the first [[Men]]: ""Giver of Gifts"".<ref>{{MR|P4i}}, The '[[Tale of Adanel]]', p. 344</ref> In an isolated note, Tolkien gives other names used by Sauron when he seduced the Elves in the Second Age: '''''Artano''''' (""High-smith"") and '''''Aulendil''''' (""Devoted to Aulë"").<ref>{{UT|6}}, Notes, p. 254</ref>

Among his many titles and epithets were:
*The '''Base Master of Treachery''', used once by Gandalf to explain why the [[Mouth of Sauron]] should not be trusted.<ref name=""Mouth"">{{RK|V10}}</ref>
*The '''[[Black Hand]]''', used twice by Gollum.<ref name=""Closed"" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Since the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]], Sauron has undergone many changes. The prototype of this character was '''[[Tevildo]]''', lord of the cats, who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', ""[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]"". Morgoth also had another servant named '''[[Fankil]]''' who led evil [[Dwarves]] and notably acted as his lieutenant, a role assumed by Sauron in the final works. 

Tevildo later was transformed into '''[[Thû]]''', the Necromancer - the first proper iteration of the later Sauron. The name was then changed to ''Gorthû'', ''Sûr'', and finally to Sauron. ''Gorthû'', in the form ''Gorthaur'', remained in ''The Silmarillion''.

In the first version of the Fall of Númenor, Sûr (Thû) originally came to Númenor in the likeness of a great bird and preached a message of deliverance, and he prophesied the second coming of Morgoth. He spoke with the king (Angor) and queen (Istar) and promised them undying life and lordship of the Earth. They believed him and fell under the shadow, and the greatest part of the people of Númenor followed them. Angor raised a great temple to Morgoth in the midst of the land, and Sûr dwelt there.<ref name=""downfall1"">{{LR|P1II2}}</ref>{{rp|§5}} As Angor felt the oncoming of old age, Sûr convinced the king that that the gifts of Morgoth were withheld by the Gods, and that to obtain plenitude of power and undying life he must be master of the West. Sûr then aided the Númenóreans in making their great armament.<ref name=""downfall1"" />{{rp|§6}} Thû survived the destruction of the island and retreated to Middle-earth where he fought wars against the surviving Númenóreans, whose hearts were not crooked and hated Thû, that assailed his temples and servants.<ref name=""downfall1"" />{{rp|§13}} Eventually Amroth,<ref group=""note"">This Amroth is a predecessor to Eldendil, hence is a Man, not an Elf</ref> the King of Beleriand, took council with Elrond, and with what Elves remained they crossed over the mountains and assailed the fortress of Thû; Amroth himself was slain, but Thû was brought to his knees, with his servants dispelled and his dwellings destroyed, and he fled to a dark forest and hid himself.<ref name=""downfall1"" />{{rp|§14}}

Prior to the publication of ''The Silmarillion'', Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to Tolkien's notes. For example, in early editions of ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth|The Guide to Middle Earth]]'', Sauron was described as ""probably of the Eldar elves"".

===The Necromancer===
In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Necromancer is an obscure villainous entity mentioned fleetingly by [[Gandalf]] as one of the dangers of the wider world. He is peripheral to the plot of the book: explaining why the company takes the dangerous road through Mirkwood rather than going around, and providing a reason for Gandalf's absence for that section of the journey. Thematically the Necromancer, a truly 'terrible' force beyond the power of the main protagonists, gives the world of ''The Hobbit'' a greater level of reality which Tolkien felt was necessary for a ""fairy-tale"" to ring true.<ref name=""Letter17"">{{L|17}}</ref>

Despite the alias, it would appear that the Necromancer was always intended to stand for Sauron, a figure from the very earliest phases of his legendarium (as [[Tevildo]] in ""[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]""). Shortly after the publication of ''The Hobbit'' Tolkien wrote:

{{blockquote|Mr Baggins began as a comic tale among conventional and inconsistent Grimm's fairy-tale dwarves, and got drawn into the edge of it &ndash; so that even Sauron the terrible peeped over the edge.|[[Letter 19]]}}

Indeed, in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', [[Thû]] is called a ""necromancer"" who ""held his hosts of [[phantoms]] and of wandering [[ghosts]]"" (l. 2075) in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]].<ref>{{LB|C7}}</ref>

However, as ''The Hobbit'' was not originally intended to be integrated with Tolkien's wider mythology the Necromancer did not necessarily need to be consistent with his [[First Age]] counterpart Sauron, rather the two were loosely linked to add an 'impression of depth' to the narrative of ''The Hobbit''. With Tolkien's decision to merge the two 'worlds' and make Sauron the central antagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' came the need to reconcile the two figures and account for his whereabouts in the millennia between the end of the First Age and his dwelling in Bilbo's Mirkwood. This was largely achieved in the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'', with Sauron becoming a much greater figure after the fall of his master, one who arguably drove the history of the entire Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth.

Fans have noted that the alias ""Necromancer"" for Sauron is obscure, as in the context of neither ''The Hobbit'' nor ''The Lord of the Rings'' Sauron is ever specifically mentioned to use [[Wikipedia:necromancy|necromancy]], i.e. controlling the [[spirits]] of the dead.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/47756/why-is-sauron-called-the-necromancer|articlename=Why is Sauron called the ""Necromancer""?|dated=|website=Stackexchange|accessed=9 January 2020}}</ref>

A later essay mentions the practice of necromancy concerning the ''[[fëar]]'' of the [[Unbodied]] Elves, mentioning that Sauron possibly did so and also taught his followers,<ref>{{MR|P3II3c}}, p. 224</ref> although this reference is not given in the context of the story.

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Sauron is briefly shown in the prologue sequence as a shadowy figure in a horned helmet in a non-speaking role.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Sauron is played by [[Sala Baker]] and voiced by [[Alan Howard]]. In these films, he is depicted as a tall -yet not gigantic - armored warlord wielding a huge mace (a blend between his vague description by Tolkien and the more detailed appearance of [[Morgoth]] as described in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''). In the first film, he is depicted dispatching a number of Elves and Men with his mace, before killing [[Gil-galad]] (offscreen; the scene figured in the concept art done for the prologue, however) and then [[Elendil]] before being defeated by [[Isildur]] using his father's [[Narsil|broken sword]] to cut off the finger wearing [[the One Ring]], as well as three others on the same hand. This strangely causes his body to explode, producing a shockwave that knocks everyone on the battlefield off their feet.

:Later on, [[Saruman]] implies to [[Gandalf]] that Sauron was unable to retain his physical form and that the Eye was his astral form, a detail which is never brought up in the novel. It is unknown if Saruman was truthful with this statement, or if he was either misinformed or lying (since he was already corrupted by his yearning for power and Sauron's influence).

:For the portrayal of Sauron as a giant eye of fire in these movies, see [[Eye of Sauron#Portrayal in adaptations]].

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Sauron is played and voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], under his assumed identity as the Necromancer. In these films, it is stated that the White Council does not discover he is Sauron until much later, during the events of these films, previously believing him to be a human with skills in magic. In these films, Sauron initially appears as a shadowy figure before assuming his armoured form from the previous films. With him as the slit black pupil, he projects flames around him, creating the visage of the Great Eye.

'''2017: ''[[Wikipedia:The Lego Batman Movie|The Lego Batman Movie]]'':'''
:In the film, Sauron, appearing as a flaming eye from atop his tower, is among the villains recruited by The Joker to aid in his conquest of Gotham City. His powers of vision prove to be a hindrance to Batman and his companions, but he is eventually inadvertently destroyed by the Kraken's mouth projectile. He is voiced by Jemaine Clement.

===Television===

::It is revealed that Sauron was disguised as [[Halbrand]] (portrayed by [[Charlie Vickers]]) the entire time. After being supposedly ""split open"" by [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]], he took on the form of a mortal [[Men|Man]] and gave to himself the name Halbrand. At some point in time, he came upon the corpse of the last King of the [[Southlands]] and took up the crest because he thought that it suited him well.

'''Ecthelion''' was an [[Elves|Elf]]-lord of [[Gondolin]], leader of the [[People of the Fountain]] and slayer of [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs]]. He was also at one point the [[Warden of the Great Gate]] of [[Gondolin]]. Ecthelion had the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute of all the people of Gondolin.

==History==
[[File:Turner Mohan - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]
In the year {{FA|472}}, Ecthelion fought alongside [[Turgon]] in the battle [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat of the Noldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> Surviving the disastrous battle, Ecthelion returned towards the Hidden City where he next appeared as Warden of the [[Gate of Steel|Great Gate]].

Twenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by [[Elemmakil]] through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]], Ecthelion appeared before them. He is portrayed as great and lordly, all clad in silver and having a bright glance. Upon his helm there was a spike with a diamond point, and he bore a shield which shimmered as ""a thousand studs of crystal"". At first denying passage for Tuor, he allows it after the latter shows the arms of [[Vinyamar]] and mentions [[Ulmo]], saying that the Lord of the Fountains should not oppose the Lord of the Waters.<ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 50-51</ref>

In the year {{FA|510}}, [[Morgoth]] attacked the city. Ecthelion battled there against [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs]] in the [[Square of the Palace|Place of the Fountain]], where they slew each other.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> The battle was well detailed in ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', and long remembered by the elves.

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Ecthelion.mp3|Ardamir}}
With the development of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name ''Ecthelion'' had its own evolution. 

The early [[Gnomish]] conception meant ""Lord of the Fountains"",<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 31</ref> from ''ecthel'' (""issue of water, spring"").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry ""Ecthelion""</ref> Its [[Qenya]] cognate was '''''Ektelion'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>

In the [[Noldorin]] stage of the name, it is composed from ''[[ehtë]]'' (""spear"") and ''[[thela]]'' (""point"" of spear).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""EK-"", ""STELEG-""</ref> Put together they could be translated as ""Spear-point"" or ""Spear-head"".

The [[Sindarin]] version should have been '''''Ægthelion''''', derived from ''[[aeg]]'' (""sharp"") + ''[[Estel|thel]]'' (""intent, resolve"") + ''[[-on]]'' (masculine suffix). However, Tolkien wrote that the early ''Ecthelion'' sounded good and it had already been used in publication (with the name of two [[Ecthelion (disambiguation)|ruling stewards]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''), so he let it as a late colloquial form of the archaic Sindarin name ''Ægthelion''<ref name=""Maeglin"" />{{rp|318–9}}, which can be translated as ""One with Sharp Will"".<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 339</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
The most detailed text about Ecthelion and his deeds during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter ""[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]"", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. There it is told that he is the lord of the [[house of the Fountain]], one of the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]]. Its people found delight in diamonds and the silver of their arrays was most beautiful to the sight.<ref name=""Gondolin"">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}} 
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Death of Ecthelion, Lord of the Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|''Death of Ecthelion, Lord of the Fountain'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
During the siege of the city, Ecthelion led his folk into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes, and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|173}} He and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a war-cry to the [[Eldar]]. Valiantly fighting side by side with Tuor and his [[house of the Wing]], they drove away the [[orcs]] until the gate was almost regained. It is said that Ecthelion and his house of the Fountain slew more orcs than had ever been slain, in all the battles of elves and orcs combined. Ecthelion killed three [[Balrogs]] and his sword did ""hurt to their fire"". However, [[dragons]] reinforced [[Melko]]'s army. Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the [[Square of the King]].<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|180–2}} 

In that place the great [[Square of the Palace|Fountain of the King]] stood and Ecthelion regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand which was remembered as the most valiant ""in all the songs or in any tale"". There Gothmog lord of Balrogs beated down [[Egalmoth]], but Ecthelion came inbetween despite being pale as steel. During the duel, Ecthelion was wounded in the hand and lost his sword. Gothmog then was about to deliver a blow with his whip when Ecthelion jumped and drove the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. Twining his legs with the enemy's, both fell into the Fountain of the King. Gothmog died there with Ecthelion, sank because of his steel armor.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|183–4}} 

Later, during the escape of the [[Exiles of Gondolin]], the young [[Eärendel]] asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were there, ""''to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles! Perchance has he gone on ahead?''"" After he was informed of Ecthelion's death he ""wept bitterly"" and said that he cared no more to see the streets of Gondolin.<ref name=""Gondolin"" />{{rp|191}}

===Aredhel's escort===
While composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered Ecthelion, [[Glorfindel]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel when she left the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]] to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name=""Maeglin"" />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name=""Maeglin"">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|328}}

===A note from ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''===
In a very late note dated c. 1972-3, Tolkien seemed to imply that Ecthelion and [[Egalmoth]] were of royal lineage, since some [[Steward of Gondor|Ruling Stewards]] of [[Gondor]] were named after ""''renowned heroes in the '''royal lines of old'''''"".<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote, p. 189</ref>

{{Quote|But the delight and pride of Aulë is in the deed of making, and in the thing made, and neither in possession nor in his own mastery.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Ainulindalë]]""}}

'''Aulë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] and one of the [[Aratar]], also known as ''the Smith'' and ''Smith of the Valar'', concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft.

==Attributes==
Aulë governed the substances of the [[Ambar]] and he delighted in all works and crafts all of which he was master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> 

He enjoyed devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like [[Melkor]], as [[Ilúvatar]] gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Aulë had always been faithful to Eru and submitted all his creations to His will. He was never jealous of others' creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed the things he has created and in act of making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Melkor who envied him; Melkor always marred his work and Aulë always sought to repair them.<ref name=vala/><ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref>

He was the third most powerful of the [[Aratar]]. He was husband to [[Yavanna]], with whom he [[Mansions of Aulë|dwelt]] in central [[Valinor]].

Several [[Maiar]] are associated with Aulë: [[Sauron|Mairon]], before being corrupted by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and becoming Sauron; and [[Saruman|Curumo]], who later went to [[Middle-earth]] as an [[Istar]] to combat the darkness, only to be swayed by the willpower of Sauron.

==History==
In the [[Song of the Ainur]] Aulë thought most of the fabric of the Earth.<ref name=ai/> During the creation of [[Arda]], Aulë worked much with [[Manwë]] and [[Ulmo]];<ref name=ai/> Aulë fashioned the substances that composed [[Ambar]], and was most involved in building the continents and mountains. As he is much like Melkor, there was strife between them and he grew weary repairing the tumults and disorders caused by Melkor on his work.<ref name=vala/> One of his [[Maiar]], [[Mairon]], would be ensnared by his enemy in those early strifes.<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

When [[Ossë]] was also seduced by Melkor, Aulë pleaded with [[Uinen]] to calm and restrain him, and so the Maia returned to his master Ulmo.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Aulë and the Seven Fathers.jpg|thumb|left|''Aulë Prepares to Destroy His Children'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
He constructed [[Angainor]], the chain of [[Melkor]], the lamps [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]] and the vessels of the Sun and Moon. 

Aulë created his own race of beings, the [[Dwarves]], because he was unwilling to wait for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] to appear. [[Ilúvatar]] knew of this and even as Aulë was instructing them He chastened Aulë. Aulë humbly repented, offering his children to the will of Ilúvatar, whom He accepted as His adopted children. Since [[Ilúvatar]] had decided that the [[Elves]] were to be the first-born race, He put the Dwarves to sleep until the Elves [[Awakening of the Elves|woke]] on [[Arda]]. 

When the [[Elves]] came to [[Valinor]], the [[Noldor]] became the students of Aulë and his friends.<ref name=vala/> [[Fëanor]] was his greatest pupil, and from him learned the craft to make the [[Silmarils]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Aule.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Aulë'' is said to derive from [[Valarin]] '''''Aȝūlēz'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref>

In the earlier ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', the name apparently means ""invention"" in [[Quenya]], from [[root]] [[GAWA]].<ref name=Etymologies>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""GAWA""</ref>

==Other names==
In [[Khuzdul]], his name is '''''Mahal''''' (""[[The Maker]]"").<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>

Sometimes he was called '''''Návatar''''',<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, ""Notes"", p. 391, note 22</ref> probably meaning ""Dwarf-father"" in Quenya.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1320168069.html|articlename=Q. ''Návatar'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=2 February 2023}}</ref>

In earlier [[Noldorin]], his name is '''''Gaul''''', usually called ''Belegol'' (""great Aulë"") or ''Barthan'' (""World-artificer"").<ref name=Etymologies/>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Aule is referred to as ''Craeftfrea'' (""Craft-ruler"").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 208</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the early ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'', the [[Gnomish]] version of ''Aulë'' is ''Óli''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 249-250</ref> He is also given the title ''Talka Marda'' (""Smith of the World"") during the text.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 180, 186</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Aulë is frequently invoked by the dwarves, although due to the game not having the license to the ''Silmarillion'', he is referred to simply as ""The First Crafter"".

'''Eluréd''' and '''Elurín''' were the sons, and eldest children of [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]].<ref name=index>{{S|Index}}</ref>

== History ==
Eluréd and Elurín were [[twins]] and had a younger sister [[Elwing]], and all three had been born in [[Lanthir Lamath]] while their grandparents [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] lived there. However, after the host of the [[Naugrim]] had plundered [[Menegroth]], their father Dior brought his entire family to the Thousand Caves to renew the kingdom of [[Doriath]].

But soon, after not many years had passed, a messenger brought the [[Nauglamír]] to Dior, which told him that Beren and Lúthien were gone from the world. The news that the Necklace of the Dwarves, which bore one of the [[Silmarils]], was in Dior's keeping provoked the sons of [[Fëanor]] to attack Menegroth. 

In the ensuing conflict, both Dior and Nimloth were slain and Eluréd and Elurín were captured, while Elwing escaped with the Silmaril. The two young boys were then taken into the woods by the servants of [[Celegorm]], in retribution for their lord's death, and left to starve.

[[Maedhros]], the eldest son of [[Fëanor]], however repented and sought for the two but never found them and their fate remained unknown.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

It was afterwards said that the brothers were lost and died,<ref name=beor>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor</ref> however some accounts say that they were saved by wild birds, and eventually found their way in secret back to [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=GA>{{GA|5}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The [[Sindarin]] name of '''Eluréd''' is said to mean the same as the boy's father's name, [[Eluchíl]], that is, ""Heir of Elu"".<ref name=index/> Therefore it contains the name [[Elu]] and the [[Taliska|Bëorian]] word ''rêda'' ""heir"".<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, p. 369</ref>

The name '''Elurín''' in [[Sindarin]] means ""Remembrance of Elu"".<ref name=index/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
=== Eluréd ===
In an early stage, Eluréd was called ""[[Elbereth]]"", an [[Ilkorin]] name containing the word ''bereth'' ""valor"". During the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name was applied to [[Varda]], and the original meaning<ref group=note>Thus probably envisioned as *""star-valor""</ref> was struck out and the character was renamed ""Eldún"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries '''BARATH''', '''BER'''</ref>

He and his brother did die in {{FA|506|n}} but their father died in {{FA|511|n}}.  In commentary following the table, [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained the year of 511 for Dior's death was incorrect and that in later sources the two brothers were twins born in {{FA|500}}.<ref name=beor/>

=== Elurín ===
In an early stage, Eluréd was called ""[[Elboron]]"", and his brother ""[[Elbereth]]"", both [[Ilkorin]] names. During the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name ''Elbereth'' was applied to [[Varda]], and the brothers were renamed as ""Eldún"" and ""Elrún"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries '''BARATH''', '''BER''', '''RO'''</ref><ref group=note>As the name appears in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' under the stem RO, it is possible that the name means *""star-rise""</ref>

According to ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', the brothers were saved by wild birds after being abandoned in the woods of [[Doriath]], and eventually found their way in secret back to [[Ossiriand]],<ref name=GA/>

In the genealogical table of the [[House of Bëor]], ""Elrún""'s date of birth was given as {{FA|495}} (and he was not a twin).

The '''Lonely Troll''', or the '''Troll''', was an old inhabitant of [[Faraway]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name=""Perry"">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

This was a very unusual [[Trolls|Troll]]: He wanted friends, he did not steal, drink beer, or even eat meat, and most amazingly of all, he was a very good cook. The Lonely Troll lived in the hills of Faraway, which seems to have been somewhere in [[Eriador]], for he was the last troll ""from [[Weathertop]] to the [[Belegaer|Sea]]"".<ref name=""Perry""/>

One day the Lonely Troll decided to seek friendship in [[the Shire]]. When he came to [[Delving]], though, the [[Shire-hobbits]] ran and hid. The old troll sat down outside of the [[Lockholes]] and wept. It was then that a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] lad, [[Perry-the-Winkle (hobbit)|Perry-the-Winkle]], came up and befriended him. The happy troll took Perry home for [[tea]] and fed him generously.<ref name=""Perry""/>

When the other hobbits learned that Perry-the-Winkle had been so handsomely fed they all went to the Troll's house to demand food for themselves. The Lonely Troll refused to feed them though since they had refused to be his friend. Instead he invited Perry to [[tea-time]] [[Mersday|Every Thursday]] and taught him to be a great [[Baker]].<ref name=""Perry""/>

==Background==
[[File:The Bumpus (no. 105, text A).jpeg|thumb|150px|""''The Bumpus''"" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].]]
In the first version of the poem, entitled ''The Bumpus'', in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was unconnected to the [[legendarium]], the Lonely Troll was a being known only as the '''Bumpus'''. On the manuscript of the poem, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] drew an unintentionally sinister<ref name=collectedpoems/> sketch of the Bumpus.<ref name=commentary/> On [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> the Bumpus became part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of Tolkien's ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series<ref name=commentary/>.<ref name=guide>{{CG|RG}} p. 754 (entry ""''Perry-the-Winkle''"")</ref>

In the third version of the poem, entitled ''William and the Bumpus'', Tolkien added an extra 111 lines,<ref name=collectedpoems/> which incorporated the scene where the Bumpus/Lonely Troll teaches William/Perry the art of baking, bringing the poem more in line with the final version.<ref name=commentary/>

In early [[1961]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> when Tolkien revised the poem for inclusion within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', the Bumpus was changed to the '''Lonely [[Worm]]'''<ref name=collectedpoems/> and then to the Lonely Troll. Despite the name change of the protagonist, Tolkien included the place-name [[Bumpus Head]] in the published version of ''[[The Dragon's Visit]]''.<ref name=commentary/>

The '''Three Trolls'''<ref>{{H|Mutton}}, Illustration: [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Three Trolls are turned to Stone.jpg|""The Three Trolls are turned to Stone""]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]</ref> ('''William ''Huggins''''', '''Tom''', and '''Bert''') were a group of [[trolls]] that captured [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|dwarves]] during the [[Quest of Erebor]].

==History==
They lived in a [[Trolls' lair|cave]] in the [[Trollshaws]], west of [[Rivendell]]. In the spring of {{TA|2941}}, they had journeyed down out of the hills in search of food, having been led by William to the area. They had already eaten their way through a village or two before stopping for the night in the woods not far from [[East-West Road|Great Road]].<ref>{{H|Mutton}}, p. 70</ref>

The light of the trolls fire was spotted by [[Balin]] who alerted the rest of the company, and on [[Thorin]]'s urging, it was Bilbo that approached and first encountered the three trolls, who were drinking, eating mutton and bickering.

Bilbo was captured while trying to pickpocket William's purse and when the rest of the company came to investigate what had happened to Bilbo they too were captured. Only Thorin put up a fight, putting out Bert's eye with a flaming branch and then hitting Tom in the face, knocking out a tooth. William caught Thorin and so all the dwarves were captured in sacks.

Gandalf, however, had returned unnoticed and throwing his voice, caused the trolls to argue amongst themselves for so long that the sun rose and turned all three of them to stone.

On [[18 October]] {{TA|3018}}, Strider and the [[Travellers|four hobbits]] came across the stone statues of the three trolls whilst travelling to Rivendell with the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 205</ref>

==William's ""pity""==
William twice stated that they ought to let Bilbo go rather than eat him, calling Bilbo a ""poor little blighter"", which leads to a row with Bert. William's comments are curious as trolls are evil by nature, having been created by [[Morgoth]] in the twilight of the [[Elder Days]]. William, however, is noted to have ""already had as much supper as he could hold; also he had had lots of beer.""<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref>

In an unsent [[Letter 153|letter]] to Christian book shop owner [[Peter Hastings]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] responded to this subject:

{{blockquote|There is no more 'pity' here than in a beast of prey yawning, or lazily patting a creature it could eat, but does not want to, since it is not hungry. Or indeed than there is in many of men's actions, whose real roots are in satiety, sloth, or a purely non-moral natural softness, though they may dignify them by 'pity's' name.<ref>{{L|153}}</ref>}}

'''Bingo Baggins''' ({{SR|1264}}-{{SR|1360|n}}) was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Bingo was the youngest of the five children of [[Mungo Baggins]] and [[Laura Grubb]], and an uncle of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He married [[Chica Chubb]], and their son [[Falco Chubb-Baggins]] was born in {{SR|1303}}.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name ''Bingo'' was used of the character that would later be named ''[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]''; first he was Bilbo's son, then ""Bingo Bolger-Baggins"" his adopted cousin.<ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, pp. 28, 34 (note 1)</ref><ref name=rc/>

==Inspiration==
It is believed that the original use of the name (for the character that would become ''Frodo'') was inspired by a family of toy koala bears of the Tolkien children, called ""the Bingos"".<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. xix</ref>

{{Quote|Gandalf was shorter in stature than the [[Elrond|other]] [[Glorfindel|two]]; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his eyes were set like coals that could suddenly burst into fire.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[Many Meetings]]""}}

'''Gandalf''' was one of the five [[Order of Wizards|Istari]] sent to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. In [[Valinor]] he was known as Olórin. Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of [[Sauron]] in {{TA|3019}}, chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey, and second to [[Saruman]] in the Order of Wizards. After his fall in [[Moria]], Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head of the Order, robed in white. He was noteworthy for his keen interest in [[Hobbits]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien.jpg|thumb|left|''Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien'' by [[:Category:Images by Kip Rasmussen|Kip Rasmussen]]]]
The wisest of the [[Maiar]], Gandalf was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=""Ainu"">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of [[Time]], he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name=""SVala"">{{S|Vala}}</ref> In his ""youth"" he was known as '''''Olórin''''' and lived in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.<ref name=""vala"">{{S|IIc}}, p. 316</ref> He became one of the [[Maiar]] who served [[Manwë]], [[Varda]], [[Irmo]], and [[Nienna]]. He was associated with light and fire, much like [[Varda]].

After the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Olórin was sent there as one of the [[Five Guardians]] to guard the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]]. But it is said he loved the Elves, and throughout his early life, he walked [[Unseen]] among them, or wore a [[Fana]] that appeared like an Elf, and he sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, taking pity on the sorrows of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and driving those who listened to him out of despair.<ref name=""vala"" />

It is possible that Gandalf, as Olorin, came to Middle-earth in the Second Age. While Galadriel ""dwelt now under the trees of Greenwood the Great"" Olórin once had a conversation with her.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 255</ref> It is possible that this was just after the year 1200, but it is said that ""only those Wise could say who are now gone"" could attest to the truth of this conversation.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 268</ref>

===Third Age===
====Arrival in Middle-earth====
During the [[Third Age]], while [[Sauron|Sauron's]] 'dark spirit of malice' was increasing over [[Middle-earth]], the Valar chose the [[Istari]], missionaries from among the Maiar, to go to Middle-earth and help the [[Portal:Characters|peoples]]. [[Manwë]] selected Olórin, who, at first, did not wish to go, as he feared Sauron. However, Manwë said that it was all the more reason why he should go.<ref name=""Istari"">{{UT|13}}</ref> Furthermore, [[the One Ring]], the location of much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere in Middle-earth. 

Olórin submitted to the will of Manwë and departed Valinor to [[Mithlond]] in the year {{TA|1000}}.<ref name=""Istari"" /> He arrived shortly after two other Istari, [[Curumo]] and [[Aiwendil]], at about the same time the [[Necromancer]] appeared in [[Mirkwood]]. Like the other Wizards, he took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey. 

At Mithlond, he was welcomed by [[Glorfindel]], his friend from Valinor who was sent to Middle-earth earlier on a similar mission, and [[Círdan]] the shipwright, who possessed [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings|Three]] Elven [[Rings of Power]]. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged old man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours. Then Círdan said ""''But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails. I will await you.''""<ref name=""ThirdAge"">{{App|B2}}</ref>

[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Gandalf then began his sojourn in Middle-earth, going about as a wanderer and counsellor. Unlike Saruman, Gandalf did not take up a single permanent residence. Gandalf never went to the [[east]]<ref name=""TT Window p. 670"">{{TT|Window}}, p. 670</ref> and apparently restricted his activities to the [[Westlands]] of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the [[Dúnedain]] and the [[Eldar]] remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he remained in Middle-earth: Elves named him ''Mithrandir'', the Grey Pilgrim, while the men of [[Arnor]] named him '''Gandalf''', which became his most common name. He was also known as ''Incánus'' in the south, and ''Tharkûn'' to the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=""Istari"" />

A legend says that Gandalf was given the [[Elfstone]] of [[Eärendil]] by [[Yavanna]] to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth; this was to be a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to [[Galadriel]], and remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it to an individual who would also be called [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

====Early vigilance====
Around {{TA|1100}},<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> the Istari and the Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided at [[Dol Guldur]] in Mirkwood. Dark shapes moved in the forest and evil began to multiply in the woods. Some thought a [[Nazgûl]] had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising.  Gandalf was unsure, and feared that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.<ref name=""Rings"">{{S|Rings}}</ref>
[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Over the next two hundred years the evil continued to grow, as well as the source directing it. [[Orcs]] were multiplying in the [[Misty Mountains]] and elsewhere. The [[Witch-king]], the mightiest of the Nazgûl, had built a fortress in [[Angmar]] in the Northern wastelands and waged unending war against the Kingdom of [[Arnor]]. Meanwhile [[Moria]] and [[Minas Ithil]] fell under a shadow, while other wars, plagues, and catastrophes occurred across Middle-earth. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in {{TA|2063|n}} to discover its secret.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> An entity known only as the '[[Necromancer]]' fled before him preventing Gandalf from identifying him.<ref name=""Rings"" /> After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.

That peaceful period was known as the [[Watchful Peace]] and lasted for almost four hundred years. However, the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, which occurred in {{TA|2460|n}}.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> Realising the returning evil, the [[Wise]] formed the [[White Council]] three years later. [[Galadriel]], bearer of one of the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; Saruman took this place because of his vast knowledge.<ref name=""Rings"" />

During his wanderings in [[Eriador]], Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the [[Hobbits]] in their country, [[The Shire]]. During the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758|n}} Gandalf came to their aid.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.<ref name=""Erebor"" /> 

When King [[Thráin|Thráin II]], a dwarf of the royal line of [[Lonely Mountain]], disappeared on a journey to [[Erebor]], Gandalf looked for him. At some point after {{TA|2845|n}} he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm. After his vain search, the Wizard exited through the [[Doors of Durin]]; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.<ref name=""journey"">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

In {{TA|2850|n}}, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to Erebor.<ref name=""Durin"">{{App|Durin}}</ref> Most importantly, Gandalf found that the Necromancer was no Nazgûl, but was Sauron himself, and he had taken [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] from the Dwarf King. Sauron was gathering the remaining [[Rings of Power]] and possibly searching for his lost [[The One Ring|One Ring]].

Gandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.<ref name=""Rings"" /> After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and Sauron's power immature. But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait, and that the One Ring had long ago rolled from [[Anduin]] to the Sea.<ref name=""Rings"" /> The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. [[Elrond]] Half-elven, a powerful member of the council, later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the [[Ages|Age]] was coming. Indeed, he added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many ""strange chances,"" and that, ""''help oft shall come from the hands of the weak when the Wise falter''"".<ref name=""Rings"" /> Gandalf did not yet realise that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of the river Anduin.

====Quest for Erebor====
Gandalf would visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the [[Midsummer]]-eve parties of the [[Old Took]] where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about [[Dragons]], [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and princesses.<ref name=""Erebor"" /> He was thus known to be ""responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures"". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named [[Bilbo Baggins]] although he was far from ""adventuresome.""<ref name=""Party"" />

Gandalf was concerned about the weak state of the North. [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] had destroyed both the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the town of [[Dale]], and Gandalf feared that [[Sauron]] might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf [[King of Durin's Folk]] [[Thorin Oakenshield]] planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> while staying the night in [[Bree]], Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.<ref name=""Erebor"">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. Gandalf was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through [[the Shire]] on his way to the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]]), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Smaug with Thorin.
[[File:David T. Wenzel - Good Morning Mr. Baggins.jpg|thumb|''Good Morning Mr. Baggins'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]
Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a ""burglar"" of Gandalf's own choosing.  Gandalf had a feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, and he remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only [[Holman Cotton]] as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the [[Yestare|Elven new year]], something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.<ref name=""Erebor"" /> He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.<ref name=""Party"">{{H|Party}}</ref> In the end Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. 

Gandalf accompanied [[Thorin and Company]] to [[Rivendell]]. Gandalf saved them from a trio of [[Stone-trolls]], and later obtained the legendary sword [[Glamdring]] from their [[Trolls|Troll]]-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.<ref name=""Mutton"">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> He also helped Thorin and Company through the [[Misty Mountains]]. When they unknowingly camped in the [[Front Porch]] of the [[Goblin-town]], the Goblins captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later by killing the [[Great Goblin]] and then rescuing the Dwarves and leading them to the exit.<ref name=""Hill"">{{H|Hill}}</ref> It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a ""magic ring"".<ref name=""Riddles"">{{H|Riddles}}</ref> The hobbit initially claimed he ""won"" it from the creature ""[[Gollum]]"" while the company was under the Misty Mountains,<ref name=""Pan"">{{H|Pan}}</ref> and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time. 
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Lord of the Eagles.jpg|thumb|''The Lord of the Eagles'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]
On their escape out, the Company was saved by the [[Eagles]] of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the [[Great Eagle]] from a poisoned wound,<ref name=""Pan"" /> and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up and flew them to their eyrie. The next day, they dropped them to the other side of the Mountains.<ref name=""Pan"" />

Gandalf then sought the hospitality of [[Beorn]], persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his [[Beorn's Hall|hall]]. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the [[Forest Gate]], he gave them some final advice (but little did he know that the lands had changed by then) before they entered [[Mirkwood]], and went to attend other obligations.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> The [[White Council]] had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing [[Dol Guldur]], ridding [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to [[Mordor]].<ref name=""ThirdAge"">{{App|B2}}</ref> When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and he realised that the instructions he gave them did not help; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]], who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Meanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,<ref name=""Fire"">{{H|Fire}}</ref> but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|the Iron Hills]] preparing for an attack by the [[Lake-men]] and the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. He was with [[Bard]] and [[Thranduil]] and revealed his presence trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] were coming to claim the treasure. He invited [[Dáin Ironfoot]] for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref name=""Burst"">{{H|Burst}}</ref> 

King Thorin was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf left Erebor for the Shire; on the way, they celebrated [[Yule]] at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where Gandalf discussed with [[Elrond]] the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.<ref name=""Erebor"" /> But they both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name=""H19"">{{H|19}}</ref>

As Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they recovered the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried.<ref name=""H19"" /> 

Gandalf was amazed by the hobbit; until then he had paid no attention to hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family. [[Third Age 2949|Years later]], he and Balin paid a visit to Bilbo, discussing the news from Erebor and Dale.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /><ref name=""H19"" />

====Return of the Shadow====
Despite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in {{TA|2951|n}} and rebuilt [[Barad-dûr]]. The White Council met for one last time in {{TA|2953|n}} to debate about the [[Rings of Power]]. Saruman quieted his peers, claiming to have knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the [[Belegaer]]. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as from this, Saruman discovered their existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire. As a result, he started sending agents to [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name=""ThirdAge"" />

[[Gollum]] had come to Gandalf's knowledge, having left his hideout. He was looking for the thief of his ring: Bilbo. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] had informed Gandalf that Gollum was traversing the forest. Then, coinciding with Sauron's declaration, Gollum apparently turned towards [[Mordor]] and was lost. Gandalf neglected the matter because he ""had much else to think of at that time"" and still trusted Saruman's knowledge. Later, Gandalf would regret this.<ref name=""shadow"" />

Meanwhile, Sauron began reassembling his forces for the final blow against the West. [[Easterlings]] from [[Khand]] and beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], joined by men from [[Harad]] reinforced his stronghold in [[Mordor]]; Orcs, trolls, and other foul beasts were multiplying while his minions were searching the Anduin for any sign of his precious One Ring.

Gandalf met [[Aragorn]], the hidden [[Heir of Isildur]] in {{TA|2956|n}}, and soon became friends with him.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> From that point on, Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.

He visited [[Minas Tirith]] and was welcomed by [[Faramir]], the son of the [[Ruling Steward]] [[Denethor]], and taught him from his wisdom. This displeased Denethor, who didn't trust Gandalf.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

[[File:Michele Mantoani - Gandalf.jpg|thumb|""Gandalf"" by [[:Category:Images by Michele Mantoani|Michele Mantoani]]]]
During this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger cousin, [[Frodo Baggins]]. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious ""[[The One Ring|magic ring]]"" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own — Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from [[Gollum]]. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was very preoccupied with the ring. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions. In {{TA|3001|n}} he organised [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], and before leaving the Shire, he convinced Bilbo to leave the Ring for Frodo. He then emphatically warned Frodo not to use it; Gandalf had begun to suspect that the ""magic ring"" was indeed a [[Ring of Power]].<ref name=""party"">{{FR|Party}}</ref> Around that time, Gandalf became unpopular in the Shire; he was blamed for Bilbo's disappearance, and was even accused of plotting with Frodo to get a hold on Bilbo's wealth.<ref name=""shadow"">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref><ref name=""party"" />

Gandalf was keen to find out more about Bilbo's ring, so he left the Shire,<ref name=""party"" /> and resumed his search for Gollum. In this, he sought the help of [[Aragorn]]. The [[Rangers of the North]] were put to guard the Shire more closely.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> Gandalf showed up only [[Third Age 3004|three years later]] to check on Frodo and the Shire, and continued for the next four years always turning up unexpectedly and disappearing before dawn. In {{TA|3009|n}} he renewed the hunt for [[Gollum]] with Aragorn, searching in the [[vales of Anduin]], [[Mirkwood]], [[Rhovanion]], and even to the edges of Mordor. The search lasted eight years, for Gandalf did not know that Gollum had been captured by Sauron.<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> Gandalf regretted ignoring Gollum for so many years, as his trail had become cold, resulting in many dark and dangerous days for Gandalf.<ref name=""shadow"" />

Studying the records in [[Minas Tirith]], Gandalf found the [[Scroll of Isildur]] in {{TA|3017|n}}, and from this, pieced together the missing history of the One Ring. On his way back to the Shire, he got word from the [[Galadhrim]] that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum<ref name=""ThirdAge"" /> and so he went to [[Mirkwood]] to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already knew. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to [[Barad-dûr]]. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned of the ""magic ring"", as well as the names ""Shire"" and ""Baggins"". The effects that Gandalf had seen on Gollum and Bilbo convinced him that Bilbo's Ring was not simply one of the [[Rings of Power]]: it was the ''[[The One Ring|One Ruling Ring]]'' of Sauron. Gandalf then returned in haste to the Shire.<ref name=""shadow"" /><ref name=""council"">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

====War of the Ring====
[[File:Alan Lee - The Shadow of the Past.jpg|thumb|''The Shadow of the Past'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Gandalf returned to the Shire on [[12 April]] {{TA|3018}} and proved to Frodo that Bilbo's ring was the ancient [[One Ring]] which the Dark Power of [[Mordor]] was looking for. He told Frodo that he gathered much of this information by interrogating the creature [[Gollum]]. Frodo exclaimed that Gollum should have been killed, however Gandalf speculated that perhaps Gollum would have a part to play before the end, and in any case, it was not for Frodo to decide who should live and who should die.<ref name=""shadow"" />

Gandalf suggested that he should leave the Shire soon and take the Ring to [[Rivendell]]. Frodo decided to leave on his next birthday, pretending to be moving to [[Buckland]], to which Gandalf agreed. The wizard stayed in the Shire for over two months,<ref name=""three"">{{FR|Three}}</ref> during which time, on [[1 May]] he went to [[Sarn Ford]] and met again Aragorn, informing him of Frodo's plans.<ref name=""FR|Strider"">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> He had a sense of foreboding and heard [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|disturbing news about war]] in [[Gondor]] and a [[Black Shadow]].<ref name=""council"" /> He decided to leave for the South and left Frodo, promising to return for his birthday-farewell party in autumn, so that they would go to Rivendell together.<ref name=""three"" /> 

He wandered around [[Eriador]] hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met [[Radagast]] who brought a message from [[Saruman]] that he must seek him at once, and a warning that the [[Ringwraiths]] were looking for the Shire.<ref name=""council"" /> Gandalf went to [[the Prancing Pony]] at [[Bree]]. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote [[Gandalf's letter|a letter]],<ref name=""council"" /> urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek someone named ""Strider"", whose real name was Aragorn, with a [[Riddle of Strider|riddle]] to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when he could. He instructed [[Barliman Butterbur]] to send the letter to [[Hobbiton]] and to expect a Mr. [[Baggins]] to arrive at the inn under the name of ""[[Mr. Underhill]]"". He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.<ref name=""FR|Strider"" />

=====Treachery of Saruman=====
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Soon thereafter, Gandalf arrived at Isengard. At their meeting, Saruman at last revealed his desire for the One Ring.<ref name=""council"" /> He offered to his ""''old friend and helper''"" that they take the Ring for themselves and seize power from Sauron.  Gandalf rejected this with horror, and was imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. [[Gwaihir]], chief of the Eagles, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape.<ref name=""council"" /> Gandalf knew he needed to return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the Ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's Nazgûl and Saruman's treacherous desire for the Ring.

Gandalf hurriedly went to [[Rohan]], desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained [[Shadowfax]] from King [[Théoden]], who later resented the gift.<ref name=""council"" /> This lord of horses and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.

Gandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf,<ref name=""council"" /> and was seeking [[Rivendell]]. Upon his arrival, Gandalf learned that the Nazgûl, arrayed as [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter,  and was worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. But for Gandalf, this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, Gandalf slept the night at the inn and in the morning left for [[Weathertop]], a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.<ref name=""council"" /> 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fire on Weathertop.jpg|thumb|''Fire on Weathertop'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
There he was assaulted at night by the Nazgûl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame.<ref name=""B3"">{{App|B3}}</ref> These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, although they were unaware that Gandalf was involved.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> Before leaving Weathertop, he marked some stones with the [[cirth|certh]] G for them to find. The next day he escaped to the north, followed by four Riders.<ref name=""council"" />

He then went directly to Rivendell, arriving a few  days sooner than [[Aragorn]].<ref name=""B3"" /> But when they arrived, Gandalf and Elrond joined their powers to cause a flood in [[Bruinen]] to drown the Riders, allowing Frodo some time to reach Rivendell.<ref name=""council"" /> Then they welcomed Glorfindel, Aragorn and the hobbits upon their arrival. Frodo was sick with a [[Morgul-wound]], but was still in possession of the Ring.

=====Fellowship of the Ring=====
Elrond called a [[Council of Elrond|Council]] after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision of what would be done with the Ring. By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples were in Rivendell for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of [[Orodruin]], where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but they eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazgûl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included [[Aragorn]], [[Boromir]], [[Legolas]] the Elf, [[Gimli]] the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo Baggins, who was named the [[Ring-bearer]], and [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref name=""council"" />

Several obstacles stood in the company's way. The vast [[Misty Mountains]] had to be crossed, for Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near [[Isengard]]. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the [[Redhorn Pass]] and there to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] near [[Caradhras]], thereby traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard.<ref name=""The Ring Goes South, p. 283"">{{FR|South}}, p. 283</ref> When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarven city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] were now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loath to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of orcs and something known only as ""Durin's Bane"".

At the [[Doors of Durin]] on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], where Gandalf read the [[Book of Mazarbul|Book of Records]], which revealed the fate of [[Balin]], the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then, Gandalf was well aware of their location and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.
[[File:John Howe - Gandalf Falls with the Balrog.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf Falls with the Balrog'' by [[John Howe]]]]
However, [[Durin's Bane]] caught up to the group at the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]]. Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge upon which they both stood, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm.  But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted ""Fly, you fools"" and vanished into the abyss.<ref name=""bridge"">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

Yet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fought long in the bowels and deep places of [[Arda]]. After restless pursuit over the course of eight days, Gandalf and the beast finally came to the summit of the [[Endless Stair]] upon the peak of [[Celebdil]]. There, he [[Battle of the Peak|fought the demon]] for two days and nights. The Balrog had burst into flame anew when it exited the stairs; ice, wind, and smoke swirled about them as they duelled. Gandalf used his last measure of strength to slay the Balrog, throwing him down the mountainside in ruin. Gandalf's spirit then left his body, having sacrificed himself to save the Fellowship.

=====Gandalf the White=====
But Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin was sent back to mortal lands by [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to ""reveal"" more of his inner [[Maiar]] strength.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref> This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his ""unveiled"" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Returns.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Returns'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
As he lay on the mountaintop, the great eagle [[Gwaihir]] came up and bore him to [[Lothlórien]], where he was clothed and replenished, and given a new staff by [[Galadriel]]. Gandalf soon learned that Frodo had left the Fellowship and was travelling to Mount Doom. As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to [[Fangorn Forest]], where he met the [[Three Hunters]]: [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], and gave them messages from Galadriel. From them, he learned that Sam went with Frodo, and he was pleased with this.<ref name=""TT White"" />{{rp|496}} Then he called forth [[Shadowfax]], and rode with them to [[Edoras]]. There he found that Saruman's spy [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had deceived King [[Théoden]] into hopeless impotence. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and encouraged Théoden to ride west to war against [[Saruman]]. By now, Gandalf was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Saruman conquered Rohan, then Gondor would be alone with enemies on all sides.

At Gandalf's encouragement, King Théoden went west to Helm's Deep where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for [[Erkenbrand]] and the forces of the [[Westfold]], which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the [[Ents]], along with the hobbits Merry and Pippin, moved against Saruman and sent [[Huorns]] against the orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of [[Isengard]] and the complete annihilation of Saruman's orcs. After the battle, Gandalf went to [[Orthanc]] with Théoden, Aragorn, and a small group. There Saruman rejected Gandalf's offer of forgiveness with contempt. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order and the Council.<ref name=""TT Voice"" />{{rp|583}} Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised King Théoden to ride to Gondor's defence as soon as possible. The wizard's mind had already turned to Gondor and the coming climactic battle in the east.

=====Siege of Minas Tirith=====
[[File:Donato Giancola - The White Rider.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|''The White Rider'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]] 
As a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a [[Palantíri|palantír]], Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to [[Minas Tirith]], the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted [[Denethor|Denethor II]], the [[Ruling Steward]], and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, [[Boromir]]. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed: the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated him with disrespect and suspicion. When [[Faramir]], the Steward's younger son, returned from [[Osgiliath]] and was attacked by Nazgûl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him. Later, Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.<ref name=""RK Siege"">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>{{rp|812}}

The city was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the [[Witch-king]]. An ill-advised counterattack resulted in Faramir receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence.  But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor then lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death. He abandoned his leadership of the city, and Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defence of the city. When the gigantic battering ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the [[Riders of Rohan]], the Witch-king departed.

However, Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to burn himself and his son Faramir to death on a pyre like the heathen kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this, and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf then learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: the Steward clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned.

Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. [[Éowyn]] of Rohan and Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large host of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the [[Elder Days]], had defeated Sauron's first move.

=====Last battle=====
But the attack against Minas Tirith was only a part of Sauron's plan to devastate the West and make himself the ruler of Middle-earth. Other armies moved in the north against [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Kingdom of Thranduil, as well as against Lothlórien and other points along the [[Anduin]]. Still commanding vast armies of orcs and men, the Dark Lord soon would move against Gondor again; the remnants of the Edain and their allies had little hope against his almost limitless resources. 

In Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, [[Imrahil]], and [[Éomer]] (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the West would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the [[Morannon]], thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan would likely result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.

Led by Gandalf and Aragorn, the army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming, and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul [[Mouth of Sauron]] rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's [[Mithril-coat]] and [[Barrow-blade]] and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of orcs and trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.

Yet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom. Even as the Battle of Morannon began, Frodo stood at the [[Crack of Doom]]. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Shadow of Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Shadow of Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
But Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with ""his precious,"" unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of [[Barad-dûr]] and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] began to collapse, their foundations crumbling. The Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again.

With Sauron gone, his forces scattered; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the [[Ring-bearer]] and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled.  Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted [[Gwaihir]] the Eagle for the third time, and set out for Mount Doom in search of Frodo and Sam. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>{{rp|948–51}} The great quest was over.

====End of the Order====
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], Gandalf, at Aragorn's request, set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared ""''Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the [[Valar]] endure!''"". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of men.

After the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to [[Arwen]], Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand to Arda had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle the affairs of the Shire themselves, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>{{rp|996}}
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - At the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|""At the Gray Havens"" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
What Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his ""''long talk''"" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on [[29 September]] {{TA|3021|n}}, he met [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] at [[Mithlond]], ready to take the [[White Ship]] over the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Aman]].  He wore [[Narya]] openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] (the later two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel. The ship passed west upon the sea,<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and then took the hidden straight path to [[Valinor]]. Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of [[Irmo]]. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the [[free peoples]] of Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. <!--In a large way, it was his victory.-->

==Characteristics==
===Personality===
[[File:Roger Garland - Gandalf.jpg|left|thumb|The Grey Pilgrim relaxing. Art by [[Roger Garland]]]]
Gandalf is often described in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh.<ref name=""Lorien"">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> He had great pity and patience, even extending to the servants of his enemies. He is said to have learned both from Nienna in Valinor.<ref name=""vala"" />
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - G for Gandalf.png|thumb|Gandalf's signature, the [[cirth|rune]] ""G"".]]
Keen observers of Gandalf often detected a veiled power, usually revealed in his eyes, which appeared deep and wise.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>{{rp|757}} He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Gandalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.

Hobbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he often went to the Shire for respites from his errands. It may be that he was amused by their nature. It may also be because they were untouched by the great evils of the world, and were more in touch with nature than Men; perhaps their agrarian lifestyle appealed to Gandalf's innate spirit and reminded him of the gardens of Valinor.

[[Círdan]] the Shipwright divined in him ""the greatest spirit and the wisest"" out of all of the Wizards that came from the West, and so he entrusted the care of [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, to Gandalf rather than to Saruman.<ref name=""Istari"" />

===Appearance===
[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]

The first description of Gandalf is preserved in the initial pages of ''The Hobbit'', written in the early 1930s. Gandalf's fame is alluded to even before his physical description (""Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion""), while the protagonist's (""unsuspecting Bilbo"") impression is that of:
{{Blockquote|...an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', ""[[An Unexpected Party]]""}}

Later, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote: 
{{Blockquote|...a figure strongly built and with broad shoulder, though shorter than the average of men and now stooped with age, leaning on a thick rough-cut staff as he trudged along... Gandalf's hat was wide-brimmed [...] with a pointed conical crown, and it was ''blue''; he wore a long ''grey'' cloak, but this would not reach much below his knees. It was of an elven silver-grey hue, though tarnished by wear - as is evident from the general use of grey in [[The Lord of the Rings|the book]]... But his colours were always white, silver-grey, and blue - except for the boots he wore when walking in the wild...Gandalf even bent must have been at least 5 ft. 6... Which would make him a short man even in modern England, especially with the reduction of a bent back.<ref name=""MB"" />}}

Although some of the Wise knew his true nature, his ""wizard-like"" appearance caused many to mistake him for a simple conjurer. After his return, his ""signature colour"" changed from grey to white, for he had been sent back to replace the corrupt Saruman as the chief of the Wizards. In the book, he claimed that, in some ways, he now ""was Saruman"", or rather Saruman as he should have been.<ref name=""TT White"" />{{rp|495}}

===Powers and abilities===
[[File:Roger Thomasson - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[Roger Thomasson]]]]
Gandalf demonstrated extensive knowledge of the land and an assortment of magical abilities from trivial to essential. 

Gandalf was the bearer of [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and described himself as the ""servant of the [[Secret Fire]]"" and ""wielder of the [[flame of Anor]]"".<ref name=""bridge"" /> Many of Gandalf's displays of power were related to fire in some way. It is not known, though, whether or to what extent his possession of Narya affected his abilities.

He created blinding flashes and other pyrotechnics to distract the [[Orcs|goblins]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] during Thorin and Company's escape from [[Goblin-town]]. On the eastern slopes, he turned pine cones into flaming projectiles that threw hot sparks and started fires that would not easily go out.

When the Fellowship was attacked by [[Wargs]] in [[Eregion|Hollin]], Gandalf spoke words of power to inflame the trees on the hillock where the company had camped. While crossing the Misty Mountains with the Fellowship, he was able to start fires under blizzard conditions. On the journey through Moria he created lights of varying intensity, magically secured doors, and broke the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. He fought and killed the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog of Moria]], although he did not himself survive the battle.<ref name=""bridge"" />

Sent back to [[Middle-earth]] as Gandalf the White, he possessed greater charisma and a limited degree of clairvoyance, although he was unable to peer into the land of [[Mordor]] to see the progress of Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. His power and authority had increased so that he could break [[Saruman]]'s staff with a spoken command, throw the treacherous wizard out of the order.<ref name=""TT Voice"">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>{{rp|583}} He also prevented Sauron's Eye from locating Frodo.<ref name=""TT White"">{{TT|White}}</ref>

He frequently used his powers for entertainment. He blew glowing smoke rings that moved around the room at his direction, and was known among Hobbits for his fireworks displays,<ref name=""Erebor"" /> for example at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name=""party"" />

When angered or aroused for battle, he seemed to grow in height and assume a terrifying aspect.<ref name=""party"" />{{rp|34}} 

Though not as keen as [[Elves]], his eyesight was sharp enough to see in darkness, and into the [[Unseen]].

===Special equipment===
It is unknown whether Gandalf required his staff to exercise certain powers. At times it appeared to focus or extend his powers, such as its emanation of light. [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] tried to forbid Gandalf from bringing it into [[Edoras]] in a clear attempt to limit his powers.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>{{rp|514}}

When he arrived in Middle-earth, Gandalf received the Elven ring [[Narya]] from [[Círdan]].<ref name=""Istari"" /> Gandalf wore it from that time to the end of the Third Age, but how he used its powers is not known.

In {{TA|2941}}, Gandalf acquired the Elven sword [[Glamdring]] from the treasure hoard of a band of trolls.<ref name=""Mutton"" /> He continued to wield this weapon throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', in particular during his fight with the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] in Moria.

Throughout his time in Middle-earth Gandalf was often seen with a pipe which he used to smoke [[Old Toby]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gandalf.mp3|Ardamir}}

''Gandalf'' is a [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] name and supposedly means ""Elvish wight with a (magic) staff"", for it contains the element ''gandr'' (""a staff, especially one used in 'magic'""). It is a substitution in the English narrative for an unknown [[Westron]] name (on the same lines as the treatment of Hobbit and Dwarf names).<ref>{{UT|13}}</ref><ref group=note>Since the name ''Gandalf'' is attributed to ""the North"" in general, it probably represents a Westron name, but one made up of elements not derived from Elvish tongues.</ref>

The Men of the North called him so because they incorrectly thought that he was of Elven-kind<ref name=""essay"">{{UT|Istari}}, citing from the essay on the Istari</ref> and because they knew his alliance and friendship with Elves well<ref name=""long note"">{{UT|Istari}}, citing from a long note from before the publication of the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1966</ref>.

Gandalf is also the name of a dwarf in the [[Völuspá]], one of the poems of the [[Poetic Edda]]<ref>{{UT|13a}}, ""12""</ref>, from where Tolkien got many of the Dwarven names used in his books.

==Other names==

*'''''Incánus''''': Gained during his long travels ""in the south"" (likely meaning no further south than [[Gondor]] or the [[Near Harad]]<ref name=""Istari"" />) of [[Middle-earth]] in the mid-[[Third Age]].<ref name=""TT Window p. 670"" /> Although ''Incánus'' seems to be of unclear language and meaning, a note in the [[Thain's Book]] says it is a [[Quenya]] form simply adapted from a word in the tongue of the [[Haradrim]]: ''Inkā-nūsh'' (or possibly ''Inkā-nūs''), meaning ""North-spy"".<ref name=""Istari"" /> <br />''Incánus'' in Latin means ""grey-haired"". However, [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the ""coincidence in form"" might be an ""accident"",<ref name=""Istari"" /> his father wrote ""Incánus Latin"" in a later published manuscript,<ref name=""PE1788"" /> suggesting that the similarity was perhaps more than a coincidence. <br />Tolkien also changed his mind several times about the meaning of ''Incánus'', besides the etymology given above his other variations were: 
**An archaic [[Quenya]] word meaning ""Mind-ruler"", from ''in(id)''- (""mind"") and ''cáno'' (""ruler, governor, chieftain"").<ref name=""Istari"" />
**An adaptation from Quenya ''incānus(se)'', meaning ""mind mastership"".<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q ''incānus(se)'', p. 88 and entry √'''IN-''', p. 155</ref>
**A possible [[Westron]] invention meaning ""Greymantle"".<ref name=""Istari"" /> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', different names used were ''Forlong''>>''Fornold''>>''Incânus''.<ref name=""WR2V"" />

*'''Láthspell''': The name given to Gandalf by [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] when the former arrived at [[Meduseld]]. It means ""Ill-news"".<ref name=""King"">{{TT|King}}, p. 513</ref> It is a modernized form of [[Old English]] ''lad-spell'' (""a painful grievous story"") from ''lad'' (""causing hate, evil, injury"") and ''spell'' (""story"", ""message"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 404</ref> In earlier drafts, it is actually Théoden who refers to Gandalf as Láthspell.<ref name=""TIKing"">{{TI|King}}, p. 444</ref>

*'''''Mithrandir''''': His [[Sindarin]] name ({{IPA|[miˈθrandir]}}), used in [[Gondor]] and meaning ""Grey Pilgrim"" or ""Grey Wanderer"", from ''[[mith]]'' (""grey"") + ''[[randir]]'' (""pilgrim, wandering man"").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 320</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Mithrandir''', p. 60</ref>

*'''''Olórin''''': His original name in [[Valinor]]. It is [[Quenya]], and its meaning is associated with the Quenya word  [[olos|''olos'' or ''olor'']], meaning ""dream"" or ""vision / of mind"".<ref name=""Istari"" /><ref name=""PE1788"">{{PE|17}}, Q '''Olórin''' , p. 88</ref> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', occurs the spelling ''Olórion''.<ref name=""WR2V"">{{WR|2|V}}, p. 153</ref>

*'''''Tharkûn''''': The name given to Gandalf by the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=""TT Window p. 670"" /> ''Tharkûn'' is [[Khuzdul]], meaning either ""Grey-man""<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry D '''Tharkûn''', p. 88</ref> or ""Staff-man"".<ref name=""Istari"" /> The word possibly derives from the unattested word ''thark'' (""staff"") + a nominal ending ''-ûn''.<ref>Mellonath Daeron, ""[https://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish]"" (accessed [[11 October]] [[2010]])</ref> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', occurs the spelling ''Sharkûn''.<ref name=""WR2V"" />

*'''The White Rider''': The name given to him by Aragorn when he rides the great horse [[Shadowfax]].<ref>{{TT|White}}, p. 500</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name ''[[Bladorthin]]'' was used by Tolkien for the character who later would be named ''Gandalf''. The name ''Gandalf'' was instead used for the character known as [[Thorin]] in the published works.<ref>{{HH|Intro}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[File:Georg von Rosen - Oden som vandringsman, 1886 (Odin, the Wanderer).jpg|thumb|''Oden som vandringsman'' (''Odin the Wanderer'') by Georg von Rosen]]
[[File:Josef Madlener - Der Berggeist.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Der Berggeist]]'' by [[Josef Madlener]]]]

''Gandalfr''<!-- this is the nominative, not a typo!-->
appears in the list of dwarves in the ''[[Völuspá]]'' of the Elder Edda, the name means ""Cane-elf"". Tolkien took the name along with the other dwarves' names when he wrote ''The Hobbit'' in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this ""rabble of eddaic-named dwarves [...] invented in an idle hour"",<ref>{{TI|Runes}}, p. 452</ref> since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in [[Third Age]] Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that [[Old Norse]] was a ''translation'' of the [[language of Dale]]. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as ""the Wanderer"", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff: Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an ''""Odinic wanderer""'' in a letter of 1946.<ref>{{L|107}}</ref>

Tolkien had a postcard labelled ''[[Der Berggeist]]'' (""the mountain spirit""), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote ""the origin of Gandalf"" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands.
[[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s.<ref>[[Manfred Zimmermann]], ""The Origin of Gandalf and Josef Madlener"", in ''[[Mythlore]]'' [[Mythlore 34|34]] (Winter [[1983]])</ref> Carpenter concluded that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself. Tolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at a time when ''The Hobbit'' had already begun to take shape.

Later, Frodo recieves [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]] as a birthday present and asks Gandalf about its purpose, having previously seen Biblo disappear with it. Gandalf tells Frodo of the forging of 20 magical rings and asks whether there are any marks on Bilbo's. Gandalf throws it into the fireplace, which reveals [[Ring-inscription|text]] on the ring, confirming Gandalf's suspicion that Bilbo's ring is indeed [[The One Ring]]. He encourages Frodo to bring the ring to [[Rivendell]] and participate in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He was imprisoned by [[Saruman|Saruman the Whute]] on [[Orthanc|his highest tower]] and was able to escape by sending a message to the birds and being rescued by the [[Eagles|Eagle]] [[Gwahir]]. He flys to [[Rohan]] and is dropped off. Gandalf is given permission by [[Théoden|the king]] to take a horse for himself. When looking for one, he discovers a a majestic white horse, named [[Shadowfax]] by the [[Men]] of Rohan. Gandalf notes his beauty, speed and the fact that that no man had ever rode him. Gandalf tames him and rides him to the Shire. He narrowly misses the Hobbits who are in the [[Old Forest]]. Gandalf, unable to meet with the Frodo, and his Hobbit friends who agree to accompany him, at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]'', writes Frodo a letter, confirming that the man known as Strider is called [[Aragorn]] and is a man to be trusted. Finally arriving at the Prancing Pony, he hears word that Frodo had set off and he spends the night. The next day, [[Bree]] is stormed by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and Gandalf pursues them on Shadowfax to [[Weathertop]]. He arrives at Rivendell 3 days before Frodo. When Frodo arrives, he is comatosed by his encounter with the Black Riders. He greets Frodo when he recovers, 4 days after the Hobbit's arrival in Rivendell. He reunites with the Hobbits at the Council in Rivendell and tells the Council members of his journey. He agrees to join the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which aims to bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. The Fellowship sets off with Gandalf leading the group. They take one final look at the House of Elrond and depart.

:His involvement in the storyline is notable for major differences from the original tale. First of all, Gandalf survives his encounter with Balrog, defeating him at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and continues the journey with the Fellowship - by the time of arrival in Lothlorien he already appears as Gandalf the White. He is present during the ambush at [[Amon Hen]], where thanks to his involvement Boromir is saved from certain death. Merry and Pippin are captured regardless and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir give chase, while Gandalf departs them to see to dealings in Rohan, including freeing of King Théoden from the spell. Following the Battle of Helm's Deep he travels to Minas Tirith along with both Pippin and Boromir, where they participate in the Siege of the city.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a hero for the ""Men of the West"" faction. Similar to the first game, he appears as Gandalf the Grey initially and Gandalf the White after level 5. He plays no part in the main storyline, but appears in the alternate ""evil"" campaign: after Sauron reclaims the Ring and lays waste to southern lands, Gandalf and few other survivors meet their end during a last stand in Rivendell.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a non-playable character voiced by [[Harry Chase]], who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the original game, before the first expansion. He first meets the Dwarven characters in Ered Luin in {{TA|2941}}, shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, characters of all races meet him in Bree in October of {{TA|3018}}, but he is too busy with concerns for Frodo and the Ring and merely sends them away to find Radagast. Finally, the players have a chance to have a proper conversation with him in Rivendell, following the Council of Elrond. During that time, Gandalf is involved in several quests, including helping the player wreck havoc among the Goblins stirring at the [[High Pass]]. After the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, players are able to retrace many of their steps, including the marks left by Gandalf such as the Burnt Top in [[Eregion]] and the remains of his fire at the pass of [[Caradhras]]. Later, Lady [[Galadriel]] bids the player to find the signs of Gandalf following his fall from the Bridge of Khazad-dum - said signs include his burnt hat at the Foundations of Stone in Moria and the signs of his struggle with the Balrog at the [[Endless Stair]] - those allow Galadriel to discern that Mithrandir is not truly dead. Players later meet him as Gandalf the White in [[Caras Galadhon]] shortly after the Fellowship has departed Lothlorien. During that time, he engages into a spiritual battle with a Gaunt-Lord Gortheron the Doom-Caller; his display of his new abilities encourages the band of Free People players and allows them to defeat the servant of Sauron.

:Gandalf is also present in several historic ""session plays"", during which players witness the important events their characters were not present for. Such events include Gandalf infiltrating [[Dol Guldur]] with the help of an Elf named Raddir, first meeting between Gandalf and Aragorn on the outskirts of Lothlorien and Gandalf's imprisonment atop Orthanc by Saruman.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:[[Martin Jarvis]] provides the voice of Gandalf. He is a playable mage hero and has three special powers: ""Healing Wisdom"", ""You Shall not Pass!"" and ""Cleansing Fire"". In the good campaign he appears at the end of the Isengard mission, where he has to kill Saruman in [[Orthanc]]. In Moria he can be played to destroy the [[Balrog]] and in Minas Tirith he has to defend the gates of the second ring. He is also one of the four playable heroes in the last mission, [[The Battle of the Morannon|the battle of the Black Gate]]. He appears as well at the end of the last mission, the Shire, of the evil campaign, in which he is defeated by [[Sauron]].
:He is also playable in the Shire, Isengard, Minas Tirith and Moria with the ''Conquest'' Mode, in Isengard and Minas Tirith in the ''Team Deathmatch'' mode, the citadel of Minas Tirith in ''Capture the Ring'' mode, and at the Black Gate, Minas Morgul, Mount Doom and the Shire during ''Hero Team Deathmatch'' mode.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Gandalf is voiced by [[Tom Kane]], who also narrates the introduction of the game. He tells that heroes like ""[[Aragorn|Aragorn the King]]"", ""[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo the Ringbearer]]"" and ""'''Gandalf the Wizard'''"" are rightly honoured, but that without a few heroes - [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] - the north of [[Middle-earth]] would have been lost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>
:He also appears in [[Rivendell]] later in the game. Players can interact with him and learn of various important events, yet the conversations do not unlock any side-quests and do not affect the main story in any way.

'''2012: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a mage-type ""guardian"" with four abilities: ''Narya's Power'', ''Flame of Anor'', ''Fireworks'' and ''Gandalf's Might''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.co.uk/guardians/gandalf|articlename=''Guardians of Middle-earth'': Gandalf|dated=|website=[http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.com/ ''Guardians of Middle-earth'' official website]|accessed=16 July 2012}}</ref>

'''Húrin Thalion''' (""the Steadfast"", ""the Strong""),<ref name=""CH3"">{{CH|3}}</ref> was the last [[Lord of Dor-lómin]] and one of the great heroes of [[Edain|Men]] during the [[First Age]]. He was the eldest son of [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] and [[Hareth]], and the older brother of [[Huor]]. He was the father of [[Túrin]], [[Urwen]] and [[Nienor]].

Húrin was regarded as ""the mightiest of warriors of mortal Men"",<ref name=""TS22"">{{S|22}}</ref> but also known for being the titular character of the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'', ""the Tale of the Children of Húrin"". In the tale he was captured by [[Morgoth]] at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] and the Dark Lord attempted to convince him to reveal the secret location of [[Gondolin]]. He refused, and in response the Dark Lord cursed his kin and imprisoned him on [[Thangorodrim]]. He was forced to watch the curse befall his children.<ref name=""CH3"" /> The curse led to some of the greatest successes and tragedies of the First Age.

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin.jpg|thumb|left|''Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]
Húrin was born in {{FA|441}} in [[Hithlum]].<ref>{{GA|141}}, p. 51</ref> His father was [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] and his grandfather [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]], founder of the [[House of Hador]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref> His mother was [[Hareth]] of [[Brethil]] who was the daughter of [[Halmir]] the lord of the [[Haladin]].<ref name=""TS18"">{{S|18}}</ref> In his youth, him and his younger brother [[Huor]] were raised in the forest of Brethil by [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]] their uncle. In {{FA|458|n}},<ref>{{GA|161}}, p. 57</ref> the brothers joined a company of scouts but were separated from them after an [[Orc]] ambush. They were pursued to the ford of [[Brithiach]] and were saved by the Vala [[Ulmo]] who caused a mist to rise and the two escaped into [[Dimbar]]. From there, [[Eagles]] flew them to the hidden city [[Gondolin]]. King [[Turgon]] welcomed the brothers, remembering their grandfather Hador who was an [[Elf-friend]] as well as the words of Ulmo who told him to deal kindly to the House of Hador. Húrin remained with Turgon for a time until he and his brother wished to return to their people. Turgon was reluctant to let the brothers leave but the king granted their wish and the brothers swore oaths of secrecy.<ref>{{CH|1}}, pp. 35-7</ref> They returned to Dor-lómin sometime before {{FA|462|n}}.

===Lord of Dor-lómin===
[[File:Steamey - Hurin.jpg|thumb|left|''Húrin'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]
In {{FA|462}},<ref>{{GA|170}}, pp. 59-60</ref> orcs [[Assaults on Hithlum|invaded]] Hithlum and Galdor was slain defending the fortress of [[Eithel Sirion]]. Húrin who had newly come to manhood took command and drove off the Orcs. He returned to rule as the third [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. Two years later he married [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]] of the [[House of Bëor]].<ref name=""TS18"" /> Their son Túrin was born shortly thereafter, followed by a daughter, [[Urwen]]. Urwen, better known as ''[[Lalaith]]'' (""Laughter""), died of the plague when she was three.

In {{FA|472|n}}, the alliance known as [[Union of Maedhros]] led Elves, Dwarves, and Men to assault Angband. Húrin led his folk to join the host led by the High King [[Fingon]]. In the battle, later named the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or Battle of Unnumbered Tears, the Union were defeated by the hosts of Morgoth. Many Elves and Men perished, including Fingon who was slain by a [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. With their liege lord slain and facing a rout, Húrin and Huor convinced Turgon to withdraw and keep the secret of Gondolin. To defend his escape, the Men of Dor-lómin formed a rearguard near the [[Pass of Sirion]] and held it giving as much time for Turgon to gather the remainder of Fingon's people and the host of Gondolin to escape. The location of Gondolin remained secret but for the Men of the Dor-lómin this was their last stand for they would not forsake the Northlands and were slaughtered by the hosts of Morgoth. By the [[Fen of Serech]], Huor was slain by an arrow through the eye, but Húrin remained steadfast crying ''[[Aurë entuluva!]]''([[Sindarin|S]]) for each foe he slew with his axe, seventy times in all. He fought until he was buried under the weight of bodies of his enemies, then [[Gothmog]] bound him and dragged him towards Angband.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

===The Curse of Morgoth===
[[File:Alan Lee - The Words of Húrin and Morgoth.jpg|thumb|right|''The Words of Húrin and Morgoth'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Húrin was brought before Morgoth, for he had learnt from his spies that Húrin was friends with Turgon, and was tortured for the secret of Gondolin's location. When he would not break, Morgoth cursed him and all his kin. The Dark Lord then chained Húrin to a chair high on the slopes of [[Thangorodrim]] where, through Morgoth's sorcery, he could watch the tragedies that would befall his family.<ref>{{CH|3}}, pp. 62-5</ref> However Morgoth concealed much of Túrin's deeds and what Húrin saw was contorted, lies mixed with the truth.
{{blockquote|'But upon all whom you love my thought shall weigh as a cloud of Doom, and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair. Wherever they go, evil shall arise. Whenever they speak, their words shall bring ill counsel. Whatsoever they do shall turn against them. They shall die without hope, cursing both life and death.'|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', [[The Words of Húrin and Morgoth]]}}
For 28 years,<ref name=""TS22"" /> Húrin watched the curse come upon Túrin and [[Nienor]], his daughter born shortly after his capture, and to those that they encounter. For instance Túrin's actions led to the [[Fall of Nargothrond|destruction]] of [[Nargothrond]], one of the last kingdoms of the Noldor. Now only Gondolin remained.

===Wanderings===
After the death of his children Morgoth released Húrin, where he hoped he could further his malice. The broken man first returned to Hithlum, which was now ruled by [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]]. Finding none of his kin, he travelled with outlaws to the mountains of [[Echoriath]], searching for the entrance to Gondolin. At first Turgon refused him, but later recanted and sent Eagles to bring him to Gondolin. Húrin had already left for the Forest of Brethil, but Morgoth's curse had already ensnared Gondolin, for the Dark Lord's spies now knew the general location of the [[Gondolin|Hidden Kingdom]].<ref name=""TS22"" />

In the Forest of Brethil he found the graves of his children. His wife, Morwen, was there and she died shortly after. After burying his wife, Húrin was taken by march-wardens to the settlement of [[Ephel Brandir]], the home of the [[People of Haleth]], with whom Túrin lived the last years of his life. Angry and grieving, he turned the People of Haleth against one another and ruined Ephel Brandir.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 291-4</ref>
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Húrin Finds Morwen.jpg|thumb|right|''Húrin Finds Morwen'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Húrin continued on to the ruins of Nargothrond, where he found the [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarf]] [[Mîm]]. The petty-dwarf had betrayed Túrin years ago and in revenge Húrin slaughtered him. Mîm had claimed the treasure of Nargothrond, but Húrin recovered the [[Nauglamír]] and journeyed eastwards.<ref name=""TS22"" />

Húrin reached the [[Meres of Twilight]] and was taken by the Elves who guarded the western borders of [[Doriath]] in {{FA|502}}.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 258</ref> He was allowed to enter [[Menegroth]], where in anger he threw the Nauglamír before King [[Thingol]] and 'thanked' him for aiding his son. Thingol's wife, [[Melian]], finally pierced through Húrin's madness and grief revealing the truth that Morgoth hid. Shamed by his actions, he picked up the Nauglamír to give to the king as a gift and memorial, then he left Menegroth no longer a thrall of Morgoth.<ref name=""TS22"" />

After leaving Menegroth, it is said Húrin, ""bereft of all purpose and desire"", cast himself into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref name=""TS22"" /><ref>{{SM|Q14}}, p. 96: ""''… it is not said that ''[Húrin]'' found ''[Morwen]'' ever upon the earth; and some have said that he cast himself at last into the western sea…''""</ref>

==Legacy==
It could be argued, that Húrin partly sowed the seeds of the destruction of [[ruin of Doriath|Doriath]] and [[fall of Gondolin|Gondolin]] or escalated it. Furthermore Húrin's presence in Brethil led to the extinction of the [[House of Haleth]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 297</ref>

His life, and the lives of his children would become known as the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'', ""The Tale of the Children of Húrin"". It was written by the Mannish poet [[Dírhaval]] who lived in the [[Havens of Sirion]] and it was highly praised by the Eldar.<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}, pp. 311-3</ref> Millennia later [[Elrond]] makes a passing reference of him to [[Frodo]] at the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>
{{blockquote|'But if you take it freely, I will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty Elf-friends of old, Hador, and Húrin, and Túrin, and Beren himself were assembled together, your seat should be among them.’'|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ""[[The Council of Elrond]]""}}

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Hurin Thalion.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Húrin'' is [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. However, in the earlier [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, the name is the combination of ''[[hûr]]'' (""vigour"") + ''ind'' (""heart"").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""ID"", ""KHOR""</ref>

==Other names==
''[[Thalion]]'' is simply Sindarin for ""Steadfast, Strong"".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''thalion''</ref>

When Túrin dwelt in Nargothrond, Húrin was indirectly called by him '''''[[Úmarth]]''''',<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 159</ref> meaning ""Ill-fate"".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[amarth]]''</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', his name was '''''Úrin'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, entry ''Úrin''</ref>

In earlier versions Húrin suffers a different fate after departing Doriath. In the ''Lost Tales'', Úrin returns to [[Hísilómë]] (Hithlum), later dies and his shade seeks [[Mavwin]] (Morwen) and together lament over their children.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 115-6</ref> This also occurs in the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'' except Húrin is not a shade.<ref>{{SM|2}} 14, p. 32</ref>

In [[Concerning ... 'The Hoard']] instead of going Nargothrond alone and leaving with only the Nauglamír, ""Húrin gathered a great company of violent outlaws, and they came to Nargothrond and slew Mim, and carried off a great part of the dragon-treasure."".  When he (and the outlaws) then goes to Doriath, he casts all the treasure ""before the feet of King Thingol in a proud gesture of scorn"". Though Thingol ""answered with patience and courtesy"", ""Húrin laughed in contempt and went out, unmolested, into the night.""<ref>[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]], ''[[Concerning ... 'The Hoard']]''</ref>

'''Morwen''' was a daughter of [[Baragund]] of the [[House of Bëor]], the wife of [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]], and the mother of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], [[Urwen]], and [[Nienor]]. She was described as being the most beautiful mortal woman of her time - tall, dark-haired, bright-eyed, and extremely majestic. She also had a stern and cold disposition. Her son Túrin, but not her daughters, inherited her beauty and her tendency to keep her emotions and thoughts to herself. She was called ''Eledhwen'', the elven-fair, by [[Men]], because of the light of her glance and the beauty of her face.<ref name=UT2>{{UT|2}}</ref>

==History==
Morwen was the daughter of [[Baragund]], [[Lord of Ladros]], and so belonged to the [[House of Beor]]. In the immediate aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Morwen, together with her first cousin [[Rían]], fled [[Ladros]] with the help of their kinswoman [[Emeldir]], first to [[Brethil]] and eventually to [[Dor-lómin]]. There, she eventually married [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]] and [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. They had three children together, [[Túrin]], [[Urwen]], and [[Nienor]]. Urwen perished to the [[Evil Breath]], a plague of Morgoth, when she was a young child.

After Húrin's departure to fight for [[Fingon]] at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Morwen, who was pregnant with their third child, remained in her husband's house as the Lady of [[Dor-Lómin]]. After Morgoth's victory at the Nirnaeth, hordes of [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] who had betrayed the [[Edain]], [[Incomers|invaded]] [[Hithlum]]. Even though they took control of the land, they left Morwen and her household alone for a while, as her incredible beauty led them to believe her to be a witch with dealings with the Elves. She was indeed in contact with small groups of Elves living in the mountains close to her house, but from them she received only information, and that very scant.

Eventually she thought it best to send her only surviving child, Túrin, to [[Doriath]] with [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]] to seek refuge. Being pregnant, and out of fear of drawing the Easterlings' attention, Morwen herself remained in Dor-Lómin.

Túrin was adopted by King [[Thingol]], who sent messengers back to [[Hithlum]] bringing her news about Túrin's well-being, invitations from Thingol and gifts from [[Melian]]. But she refused to leave her home, not the least because her daughter [[Nienor]] was still a baby.<ref name=UT2/> In her stead she sent to Túrin the dragon-crested [[Helm of Hador]], the heirloom of their house.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>

Morwen's house was oppressed by [[Brodda]]'s Easterlings, although she received the help of [[Aerin]], a kinswoman of Húrin whom Brodda had taken to wife against her will, and who knew Morwen's counsel.<ref>{{CH|12}}</ref> Meanwhile, Túrin had exiled himself out of Doriath and made himself a hero. The fame of the [[Black Sword]] reached to Hithlum, saying that he was cleansing [[Beleriand]] from perils, without Morwen knowing that he was her own son. Nienor now had grown up, and Morwen eventually fled the tyranny of Hithlum through [[Ered Wethrin]] and came to Doriath, only to find out that her son had left.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref> Túrin's travels also brought him to the north and liberated Dor-Lómin, but it was too late, as Morwen and Nienor had long gone. 

[[Elves of Nargothrond]] came to Doriath, bringing news about its [[Sack of Nargothrond|sack]] by [[Glaurung]] and that Túrin was under [[Orodreth]]'s service in [[Nargothrond]]; hearing this, against Melian's counsel Morwen left Doriath to seek news of him. [[Mablung]] and [[march-wardens]] were tasked to accompany her; unknown to both, [[Nienor]] had joined them. Mablung reached her near [[Sirion]] but Morwen refused to hear him; then Nienor revealed herself and both women tried to persuade each other to return.

As Morwen refused to go back, and Nienor wouldn't abandon her mother, Mablung perforce passed them over the [[Meres of Twilight]] and left the women with guards upon [[Amon Ethir]] before setting out with a small company to scout Nargothrond as were his orders by Thingol. Yet [[Glaurung]] left Nargothrond and Mablung was unable to prevent them both from getting ensnared in the traps of the [[Dragon]]. 

Morwen was then lost in the fog that arose from the Dragon's steamy breath and Mablung heard no news from her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Húrin Finds Morwen.jpg|left|thumb|''Húrin Finds Morwen'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Years later, Morwen, now in her fifties, came to the [[Forest of Brethil]] and found the graves of her children at [[Cabed Naeramarth]]. Húrin found her there. She was dying, and asked her husband how their son found his sister; but Húrin never replied. They spent the evening together until she passed away at sunset. Húrin dug for her a grave above Cabed Naeramarth on the west side of the [[Stone of the Hapless]] cutting the words ''Here lies also Morwen Eledhwen''.

According to the words of [[Glirhuin]], the mound survived the [[War of Wrath]] and as [[Tol Morwen]] was the westernmost isle off the coast of [[Lindon]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Morwen'' is [[Sindarin]] for ""Dark Maiden"", from ''[[môr]]'' (""darkness, dark, night"") + ''[[gwenn]]'' (""maiden"").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[môr]]'', ''[[wen]]''</ref>

==Other names==
Her epithet, '''''Eledhwen''''', means ""Elfsheen""<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> or ""Elven-fair""<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref>. In the early [[Noldorin]] phase, it meant ""Elf-maid"".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry ""ELED""</ref> J.R.R. Tolkien mentioned that the Old English adjective ''aelfsciene'' had been applied to Sarah and Judith and translated this Old English adjective as ""elven-fair"".<ref>{{L|236}}</ref>

She bore the title '''Lady of Dor-lómin''', being the wife of Húrin, the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]].<ref>{{CH|List}}, entry ''Lady of Dor-lómin'', p. 306</ref>

In early versions of the tale, she was called ""Tirannë"", ""Mavwin"", or ""Mavoine"".<ref>{{LT2|II}}</ref>

'''Thorin III Stonehelm''' ([[Third Age]] 2866 – [[Fourth Age]]) was the son and heir of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] of [[Durin's folk]], who was king of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and the [[Iron Hills]] in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]].

==History==
During the [[Lord of the Iron Hills|Lordship]] of his father, Thorin was more than likely born in the [[Iron Hills]] to Dáin II Ironfoot. During his younger years he saw his people able to finally return to the Lonely Mountain after many years of further exile, and wandering. He himself became a prince with the rise of his father as [[King under the Mountain]], and over all the [[Longbeards]].

During the [[War of the Ring]] at the age of one hundred fifty-three, Thorin fought the [[Easterlings]] in the [[Battle of Dale]], and took refuge in Erebor after his father was killed at its gates, along with [[Brand]] [[King of Dale|king]] of [[Dale]]. Thorin then became [[King under the Mountain]].

When the news of Sauron's [[Battle of the Morannon|defeat in the South]] came to the ears of the enemy, they became dismayed and the Dwarves and Men came forth from the mountain and routed them driving them back of the river [[Carnen]], never troubling them again.<ref name=""Chief"">{{App|Chief}}</ref>  

Under Thorin's leadership Erebor and Dale were rebuilt along with Dale's new king [[Bard II]], son of Brand, and once again both their people prospered, and their realms became close allies with the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] of King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].

During his rule [[Gimli]], son of [[Glóin]], led a number of Dwarves South to [[Aglarond]], where a new colony was settled. Also during his rule mining for ''[[mithril]]'' in [[Moria]] slowly began again, although Moria was not yet permanently settled.

Thorin III had a descendant who was held to be the reincarnation of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]], and would rule as [[Durin VII]] the Last.<ref name=""Making"">{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278-9</ref> 

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means ""Bold"".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, ""Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion"", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The origins of the epithet ""[[Stonehelm]]"" are mysterious: [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] doesn't provide us with any account that would shed light on its meaning.

'''Ufedhin''' was an [[Elf]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. He was notable for his treachery of [[Tinwelint]], King of [[Artanor]].

==History==
===Treasure of Glórund===
Ufedhin was a very wealthy [[Gnome]] who dwelled in Artanor. When [[Húrin|Úrin]] brought the treasure of [[Nargothrond]] before Tinwelint as a payment for his ""fair keeping"" of his wife and children, Tinwelint, on the advice of [[Melian|Gwendelin]], wanted to throw the treasure into the river. However, Ufedhin attempted to convince him otherwise and, due to the curse of [[Mîm]] the Dwarf, Tinwelint decided to keep the treasure.

Ufedhin - who was a close friend of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Nogrod]] - convinced Tinwelint to ask for their aid in the reshaping of the gold. When they agreed to work for Tinwelint, he sent half of the gold to Nogrod as a loan and kept the other half, which they were bidden to remake and reshape into many different objects.

However, Tinwelint was already blinded by greed and decided to take Ufedhin as a hostage so that the Dwarves would not trick him. This angered Ufedhin and caused him to plot revenge on the King. When the Dwarves finished their work (including the [[Nauglafring]], the Necklace of the Dwarves), Ufedhin convinced them to ask the King to pay an exorbitant price. Upon hearing this price, the King ordered Ufedhin and the Dwarves to be whipped and paid them a pittance for their work.

===Death of Tinwelint and Sack of Artanor===
[[Naugladur]], King of the Indrafangs, heard the news of what had happened in Artanor and also received a message from [[Bodruith]], King of [[Belegost]], of the death of Mîm and the true nature of the acquisition of [[Glorund]]'s gold. He was furious and decided to wage a war against Tinwelint.

Ufedhin offered to guide the armies of Nogrod and Belegost through the [[Girdle of Melian|Girdle]] around Artanor. At that time, another Elf from Artanor named [[Narthseg]] revealed to Naugladur that Tinwelint would commemorate the [[Hunting of the Wolf]] with a great hunt in the woods near the borders of Artanor.

In these woods, Tinwelint was slain by Naugladur, and the army of Nogrod ravaged Artanor. Coming to Menegroth, with Naugladur holding Tinwelint's head and bearing the Nauglafring around his neck, Ufedhin walked to the throne of Tinwelint and sat right next to his wife Gwendelin, who reprimanded him for his actions. This tongue-lashing would continue to haunt Ufedhin.

On the way back to Nogrod, Ufedhin tried to slay Naugladur in his sleep, lusting for the Nauglafring. Bodruith, who also lusted after the necklace, tried to kill Ufedhin in turn, but was slain by him. At that Naugladur awoke, but Ufedhin had already fled. While he was fleeing he was caught by the [[Green-elves]] led by [[Beren]] who had already heard about the sack of Artanor and Tinwelint's death by Gwendelin. However, he concealed his identity and told Beren where Naugladur and his host would pass on their way back to Nogrod.

In the end, when Beren's army annihilated the Dwarves and Beren himself slew Naugladur, Ufedhin saw Gwendelin for the final time. He could not endure the sight of her, and fled screaming in pain and terror. None knew what became of him after this.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ufedhin'' is a [[Gnomish]] word meaning ""outcast, outlaw"" or ""one who changes his clan and goes to a new kinship"".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 74</ref>

{{quote|Ulmo loves both Elves and Men, and never abandoned them, not even when they lay under the wrath of the Valar.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ""[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar""}}

'''Ulmo''' was a [[Valar|Vala]], also known as ''King of the Sea'', ''Lord of Waters'', and ''Dweller of the Deep''.<ref name=""UT1"">{{UT|1}}</ref> One of the mightiest of the [[Ainur]], he was third in majesty of the [[Aratar]], after [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].

At several points Ulmo was notable for setting himself apart from his brethren, and also for being the friendliest to the [[Children of Eru]].

==Attributes==
Ulmo was the Lord of Waters and King of the Sea.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> He was the Ainu most deeply instructed in music, and it was said that in water the [[Eldar]] could hear the echo of the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref> He lived in the deeps under [[Ambar]] who alone saw where he devised his music and whence he governed all waters, bays and rivers.<ref name=s1/><ref name=vala/>

From the beginning Manwë had been his closest friend and ally and they came together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air, or mists and dew. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.<ref name=ai/>

Ulmo was unique among the Valar in several ways; he was alone, taking no spouse among the [[Valier]]; he didn't dwell in [[Valinor]] but in [[Ekkaia]] from the beginning, preferring the deeps of the seas around and below [[Ambar]], and the rivers. He seldom appeared to the councils of his brethren, save in matters of great importance.<ref name=vala/> 

Likewise, he seldomly wore a [[fana]] and rather came to the shores unseen or entered firths of the sea and rivers. It was said his spirit was in the very veins of the world. He spoke through the sound of water, and made music with his horns the [[Ulumúri]]. But whenever he appeared, he was dreadful and terrible ""as a mounting wave that strides to the land""; he wore a dark foam-crested helm and a shimmering silver-green mail, and his voice was deep like the ocean.<ref name=vala/>  

Ulmo cared about Arda and the Children of Eru, and through the veins of the world he kept in touch with them and saw every grief and need, and thus knew more of the goings on with them than even Manwë. Even while the Valar were secluded in Valinor or when the Children were under the wrath of his brethren, Ulmo, alone of the Valar, was the one who never forsook them.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref><ref name=vala/> However, it was not done as rebellion towards other Valar, but because it was a role to which he was ""appointed ere the making of the World"".<ref name=""UT1"">{{UT|1}}</ref>

==History==
Ulmo was very close in friendship to Manwë before [[Ea]] was made, and although Manwë was the most dear to [[Ilúvatar]], of all the Ainur Ulmo was most deeply instructed in music. Ulmo with Manwë and [[Aulë]] were the architects of [[Arda]].<ref name=ai /> Ulmo's vassal [[Ossë]], and Ossë's spouse [[Uinen]] were, to the elves, the best known of the [[Maiar]]. Through them Ulmo would learn much of the elves.<ref name=vala/>

When the Valar retreated to [[Valinor]], Ulmo remained to the Outer Sea, and while his brethren neglected the [[Outer Lands]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], Ulmo kept the earth alive under the darkness.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> 

He seldomly came to the Councils of [[Máhanaxar]], such as the time when the Valar were to prepare to [[Battle of the Powers|attack]] Melkor's fortress of [[Utumno]]. He also was the chief of a minority of the Valar who believed that the Elves should remain free in [[Middle-earth]], and order and heal the hurts of the land with their skills and grace, but this opinion was overruled.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>

Nevertheless he eventually helped them get to Aman, because he knew that was what they wanted, and he accepted that. He tore a great piece of land off the shores of [[Beleriand]] and used it to transport the Eldar to the blessed coasts of Aman. He anchored the island (it was renamed [[Tol Eressëa]]) in the [[Bay of Eldamar]], which he did because he knew the minds of the [[Teleri]].

When the time came for Melkor to be given a second chance and was pardoned, Ulmo and [[Tulkas]] were still distrustful of him, but both obeyed Manwë's bidding.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

During the [[First Age]] Ulmo protected [[Sirion]] and [[Gelion]] and directed more than any other Vala the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]. He urged [[Turgon]] to build [[Gondolin]] and [[Finrod]] to build [[Nargothrond]]. 

He chose [[Tuor]] as his instrument before his birth, by helping [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]] reach [[Gondolin]] and telling [[Turgon]] to accept him, as aid would come from the [[House of Hador]]. Years later, he guided [[Tuor]] directing him to Gondolin as a messenger for Turgon. Despite [[Ulmo's warning]], Turgon chose not to abandon Gondolin. Tuor eventually married Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] and fathered [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]]; Ulmo saved [[Elwing]] from the sack of the Havens of [[Sirion]], and thus she took the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] to her husband Eärendil which allowed them to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for their mercy.

==Etymology==
The name ''Ulmo'' is said to derive from the [[Valarin]] '''''Ullubōz'''''.<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

Alternatively, ''Ulmo'' is a [[Quenya]] title, which means ""the Pourer"", from ''[[ulya-]]'' (""to pour"") + ''[[-mo]]'' (agentive ending ""-er"").<ref name=Quendi />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earlier writings his [[Gnomish]] name was ''Gulma''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 349, note ""Ulmonan""</ref> Later his Gnomish name was  '''''Ylmir'''''<ref>{{LB|1d}}, p. 93</ref><ref>{{SM|2}}, p. 13</ref> (see [[Tuor]]'s ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]''). [[Noldorin]] translations of his name were given as '''''Nûron''''' and '''''Ulu'''''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ""NŪ-"" and ""ULU""</ref><ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 7</ref>

In the [[Gnomish Lexicon]] he is given the name '''Vailimo'''.<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref>{{rp|18}}

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Ulmo is referred to by various names: ''Garsecges frea'' (""Ocean ruler""), ''ealwaeter-frea'' (""All-waters ruler"") or ''agendfrea ealra waetera'' (""owning lord of all waters"").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

His palace, on the bottom of the [[Outer Sea]], was called [[Ulmonan]].<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 270</ref>

'''Treebeard''', also known as '''Fangorn''', was the oldest of the [[Ents]], a tree-like being who was a sort of ""shepherd of trees"". Very tall and stiff-limbed, with bark-like skin and leafy hair, like most Ents, Treebeard took a long time to make up his mind. He repeatedly spoke of not ""being hasty"". 

Treebeard is described along with [[Tom Bombadil]] as the [[eldest|oldest being]] in Middle-earth. By the later [[Third Age]], he lived in [[Fangorn Forest]], which was named after him.

== History ==
Treebeard was the [[eldest]] living being of [[Middle-earth]], having been awakened along with the Ents during the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]], sometime after the [[Awakening of the Elves|Awakening]] of the [[Elves]], who taught the Ents to speak language in the first place;<ref name=Treebeard/>{{rp|468}} although he said that there were trees in Fangorn that were ""older than he"". His realm was the immense forest that spanned from [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]] to [[Calenardhon]] and saw it destroyed and diminishing by the centuries. From the [[Elder Days]], Treebeard had memories of the [[Willows|willow]]-meads of [[Tasarinan]], the [[Elms|elm]]-woods of [[Ossiriand]], the [[Pines|pine]]-trees of [[Dorthonion]] and the [[beeches]] of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}, ""[[In the Willow-meads of Tasarinan]]""</ref> 
[[File:Luca Bonatti - Farewell to Fangorn.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Farewell to Fangorn'' by [[:Category:Images by Luca Bonatti|Luca Bonatti]]]]
He was with his beloved [[Fimbrethil]], but as with all of the other [[Entwives]], she left for the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]], and had been missing ever since, especially after [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed those lands in the [[Second Age]]. 

The forests of the Ents diminished and [[Fangorn Forest]] was one of their remnants, where Treebeard and other Ents retreated. There he kept his [[Ent-houses]] one of which was the [[Wellinghall]] in the flanks of [[Methedras]].<ref name=""Treebeard"">{{TT|III4}}</ref> 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Treebeard and the Entmoot.jpg|200px|thumb|''Treebeard and the Entmoot'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
During the [[War of the Ring]], in [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}} he discovered [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] (""Merry"") and [[Peregrin Took]] (""Pippin"") after they escaped from [[Orcs]]. He welcomed them to the [[Wellinghall]]. The hobbits brought news of the Wizard Saruman's treachery and [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]] damaging the trees, but Treebeard already knew of these disasters.

The Ents—usually a very patient, deliberate people—did become angry at Saruman, whose forces were cutting down large numbers of their trees. Treebeard convened an [[Entmoot]], a meeting of the Ents at [[Derndingle]].<ref name=""Treebeard""/>

After lengthy deliberation Treebeard led them marching on Saruman's fortress at Isengard in [[March 3]], accompanied by the two Hobbits: the last march of the Ents. In the [[Battle of Isengard]] they destroyed the valley and trapped Saruman in the tower of Orthanc. Treebeard appointed the two Hobbits door-wardens of Orthanc. There Treebeard also saw [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] who brought a message for Saruman, and caught him and captured him inside Orthanc.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

[[5 March|Two days later]] they were soon joined by a company of [[Rohirrim]] with [[Gandalf]], returning victorious from the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After deposing Saruman, Gandalf asked Treebeard to pour back the water into Orthanc so that Saruman can never escape. Treebeard declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the ""Watchwood"".<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

The following months the Ents destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]], filling it with trees; Treebeard saw the flight of many Orcs who met their doom in the forest. He kept their prisoner informed, who would come to the window of Orthanc to listen. 

Eventually the Wizard withered away and eventually managed to make the Ents pity him, and on [[August 15]] they let them leave Isengard. However, before he left, Treebeard made him lock the tower and hand over the [[key of Orthanc]]. [[August 22|A week later]] Treebeard welcomed [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company at Orthanc, and related these news.

Presumably Treebeard stayed for some time in the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]], which King Elessar declared an Entish realm.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Fangorn.mp3|Ardamir}}
Treebeard is the direct translation of the [[Sindarin]] name ''Fangorn'', from ''[[fang]]'' (""beard"") and ''[[orn]]'' (""tree"").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 84</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In early versions of [[The Lord of the Rings]], Treebeard was an evil [[Giants|Giant]] who was in league with the [[Sauron|Enemy]]. It was he who held Gandalf captive, a role later given to Saruman, while in other drafts he tries to entrap the [[Frodo Baggins|Ring-bearer]] for his master by appearing friendly.<ref>{{RS|3XXI}}</ref>

In a later note he was considered as ""kindly and rather good"", and described as ""About 50 feet high with barky skin. Hair and beard rather like twigs. Clothed in dark green like a mail of short shining leaves. He has a castle in the [[Black Mountains]] and many thanes and followers. They look like young trees [?when] they stand.""<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>{{rp|411}}

== Inspiration ==
Treebeard's booming voice was inspired by the way [[C.S. Lewis]] spoke.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, "" 'The New Hobbit' "", p. 258</ref>

'''1978: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:[[John Westbrook]] provides the voice of Treebeard. His actions in the overthrow of Isengard are not mentioned: he merely brings Merry and Pippin to Gandalf.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Stephen Thorne]] provided the voice of Treebeard.  Thorne also sings the songs of 'The Lore of Living Creatures' and 2 verses of the 'Song of the Ents and the Entwives.' His participation in the destruction of Isengard is fully documented, but he is the only Ent given a voice in the production.  He also appears in the penultimate episode when the company pass through Isengard on their return.  As in the book, he reveals to Gandalf Saruman's departure from Orthanc.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Treebeard is played by Friedrich Schütter.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by [[John Rhys-Davies]], who also plays [[Gimli]].

:The Ents at the [[Entmoot]] initially decline Merry and Pippin's request for help. Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards [[Isengard]], claiming that it is the last place [[Saruman]] would look for them because it puts them so close to danger. Treebeard is initially confused, but ultimately succumbs to Pippin's request. When Treebeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents. They attack Isengard and manage to flood it.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Treebeard, fully CGI, makes some appearance at Isengard, when Gandalf, alongside with Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Eomer and king Theoden arrive there.

'''2002-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Treebeard is provided by Leopold Haverl.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:Bob Joles plays Treebeard, who engages Wormtongue during the Battle of Isengard.
:In the Evil Campaign, Treebeard and the Ents retreat to the Shire as the armies of Sauron sweep across Middle-earth. Treebeard fights in the final battle, but is killed by [[Durin's Bane]].

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Treebeard's encounter with Merry and Pippin, the Entmoot and the Breaking of Isengard are told in a series of flashbacks, narrated either by Gandalf, the Hobbits or Treebeard himself. The player themselves does not meet Treebeard until after the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman. Afterwards, Treebeard remains at the Ring of Isengard to watch over the Wizard.
